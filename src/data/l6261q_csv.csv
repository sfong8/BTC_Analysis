I have brain damage thanks to them.

My entire adult life has been a struggle, with little to no help for the problems caused by others, by a society that wants to destroy what is different rather than let anyone step out of line and flourish, unless a penny can be made off of their hard work.

Well, fuck them all. Fuck my shit parents, and fuck the sick fucks they were trying to emulate. Fuck the politicians that used middle class tax money to bail out the rich and kill the American dream. Fuck them all right up the god damn ass.

I have fuck all, but I'm in one share on GME at $293. Just to say that I was on the fucking line while we tore down these thieving, life destroying bastards.

I won't sell it for a penny under $5k. I keep making small amounts of money in other stock trading, I can make it up in a few weeks if I lose.

And now that I've joined you beautiful degenerates, maybe, just maybe I can actually pull together a better life for my wife and daughter.

Make the rich pay their fair share for once. The government won't do it, so let's tear them down right where they live."

WHEN WE FORSAKE OUR FRIENDS AND BREAK ALL BONDS OF FELLOWSHIP.
BUT IT IS NOT THIS DAY!!!!
AN HOUR OF WOLVES AND SHATTERED SHIELDS, WHEN THE AGE OF MEN COMES CRASHING DOWN,
BUT IT IS NOT THIS DAY!!
THIS DAY WE FIGHT!!!!!
BY ALL THAT YOU HOLD DEAR ON THIS GOOD EARTH, I BID YOU STAND AND FIGHT!!"

mango1144,1611760734.0,"Pump and dumps are fun but if you want to buy an actually good company that will at least double within 3 months B-F-T is the play.

B-F-T will be announcing its merge date with Paysafe by the end of March. 

Once the announcement is made it's shooting up to 20-25.

PT 30-60 EOY. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

There are a ton of other good SPAC dips to buy as well.

All of the money flooding into pump and dump short squeeze plays is creating a vaccume for SPACs. All of that speculative money will soon flood back into SPACs.

BUY. THE. SPAC. DIPS."

CaptainWeeks,1611760843.0,Your buying power balance? Depends on the limit of your account as far as immediate availability of deposits goes. If you have a basic account they only allow for a max of $1000 of deposits  immediately available to trade. Upgrade to gold and I believe that figure goes up to $3000 or $5000.

EDIT: /u/BurnnntBread, for example, created that account 59 minutes ago; /u/uponnorth created that account 52 minutes ago.  ALL SHILLS (in my opinion) 'cuz the ""big boys"" are **scared to death**...in my opinion.  

Did I provide enough ""in my opinions"" to constitute some kinda disclaimer.  :)"

Some investors are worried about mounting losses by hedge funds spilling over to other areas of the market as those funds sell other securities to raise cash. Investors are also concerned the speculative behavior is a sign the market is overvalued and a pullback is near."

TeamRyan,1611761696.0,"-This stock was more than 7$ before covid (And before GIGANTIC amounts of quantitative easing inflated the dollar) and over 20$ a year before that.

-Box office sales hit record highs in 2019

-Streaming TV/Movies did not replace ""going to the movies"". Box office sales hit records high in 2019 and watching movies at home had been a thing for decades.

-AMC is not going bankrupt this year as of yesterday, 900m loan secured

-Large amount of movies are ready to be released in the cinemas

-People have spent the past year inside, they will be eager to do go out things

-Short interest at 60%+ of float, potential short squeeze happening

-Many 7$ calls expiring friday, IF price increases above 7$ before then, this will take of like a fucking ICBM

-A lot of smaller competetion wiped out due to COVID

Even without the short squeeze, this is a buy and hold opportunity. Could easily go back to 7$.

TV didn't kill the cinema.

DVD didn't kill the cinema.

Streaming didn't kill the cinema."

There are HUNDREDS of these accounts active right now.    

Low karma accounts, new or many years old with no submissions for weeks/months/years. Suddenly now telling you to buy AMC, NOK, BB, etc.

The institutions are pay people to manipulate you.

There are many bots spamming other stocks as a distraction. Make no mistake, a lot of these bots are intentional distractions by big capital firms scared of what we (you) are doing. Just look at how many posts they have and when they were created.

This is a good sign - AND ALSO A REMINDER FOR US: WE NEED LASER FOCUS ON GME.

You stand here holding my hand, in this moment in time, wondering why you didn't get in when it was under $20. Why you didn't get in when it was under $40.

I bought back the sell leg of the covered call on the dip this morning making enough profit to cover my risk where I can sell another one now at the 35 strike with no money on the table now.

cuddlypolarbear1,1611763429.0,"Smooth brain time. I'm probably wrong but hear me out. Everyone's hopping on AMC for a short squeeze. Given recent price explosion following news of funding and current price level way above pre-covid levels, I'm inclined to think a lot of shorts may have already covered, likely collateral damage from GME mooning. That squeeze may never come and with this insane volume you might not even notice it. You retards may be trading an overvalued piece of junk amongst yourselves. Or it could just as well moon to $420.69 the fuck do I know"

WontonKill,1611763533.0,"NEW YORK, Jan 27 (Reuters) - Shares of GameStop and AMC Entertainment Holdings soared for a fourth day running on Wednesday, forcing hedge funds to retreat from heavy losses and sparking calls for scrutiny of a social media-driven trading frenzy.

Short-seller Citron, a target for some of the individual traders who have helped drive huge gains for a number of niche Wall Street stocks in the past week, said in a video post it had abandoned its bet on GameStop shares falling.

Wall Street opened lower despite the buying mania in a small group of stocks. The S&P 500 was off 1.3% in morning trade and the Nasdaq was 1% lower.

INVESTOR COMMENTS MATTHEW KEATOR, MANAGING PARTNER, THE KEATOR GROUP, LENOX, MASSACHUSETTS

""When you start to see this type of excessive exuberance at these levels, you have to stop and take pause and realize that valuations matter.

""It's a dangerous game to play from both sides of the spectrum, whether you're long or short. You get close enough to the fire you're going to get burned.

""At some point in time valuation is going to matter and it won't matter what social media is cheering the stock on. At some point in time that's going to be secondary to the fundamentals.

""It certainly is strange days for sure."" ERIC KUBY, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, NORTH STAR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT CORP, CHICAGO

‚ÄúThis is something that is not going to continue much longer because it is completely decoupled from any kind of economic reality. This retail-driven short squeeze is kind of taking these exaggerated moves to new levels that I have never seen before. It is sort of remarkable. I don‚Äôt know when it is going to end, but I don't think it can continue much longer because it‚Äôs so obviously irrational that it has got to end really badly, in my opinion.‚Äù

MATTHIAS SCHEIBER, GLOBAL HEAD OF MULTI-ASSET SOLUTIONS, WELLS FARGO ASSET MANAGEMENT, LONDON

‚ÄúA lot of this is driven by retail investors, and these platforms allow you to trade globally, so it's very easy for stocks like GameStop or Nokia to shoot up.‚Äù

‚ÄúGiven the liquidity that we have seen, this phenomenon might stay around for a while. But ultimately, it will come back to the fundamentals.‚Äù

""(On disrupting broader market) ‚ÄúNot at this point, it's too small. You could argue that we've seen big swings in stocks like Tesla that could impact the wider market. But that said, there is also a lot of institutional money in those stocks given their growth potential.‚Äù

‚ÄúRetail trading can lead to short-term distortion similar to what we experienced in the early 2000s, but longer-term, investors will focus on the fundamentals.‚Äù

Please let me know if I am but I've been pretty well on my own in reddit CANNABISfuturus trying to let the world know about all the benefits of cannabis legalization after being kicked out of reddit weedstocks for voicing my opinions on racial discrimination and non stop APHA pumping. I love what you guys have done to wallstreet and would love to have some of you post some of your opinions in my sub. Again I hope I'm not breaking any rules here. Never be afraid to get into good trouble. Always fight the good fight. Thanks guys and girls and please keep up the great work. FYI: I am a privileged white guy that hates injustice.

Has anyone had a look at SIRI? I think there is great upside there. Of course heavily shorted, but also rules the satellite radio market - infrastructure that isn't going away even if profits fall, so ripe for a pivot long-term.

Calls are a great value, in my opinion. Worth a look."

I get that they're trying anything and everything to bring in legal entities in because they got caught with their pants down but this is just a nuisance; I have to vet even retarded comments now to see if they're genuine human rocket ships or if they're fake robot rocket ships. 
I don't know how to solve this problem without detriment to the subreddit or reddit as a whole. I feel like there should be an open letter or something for ideas on how to remove spam and fake accounts.
I also wanted to say that the mods, including automod, are doing a noticeable job, if you don't believe me sort by new and watch spammers and shills disappear."

ANintendoGeek,1611764823.0,"I just started last week, and this is how I started. Im not an adult so I made a custodial account through Charles Schwab and it was free. I then got the app RobinHood and linked my account there and putting money for my Schwab account into RobinHood. Next, I watched lots of youtube videos on how to get stsarted, what to avoid, what some of the terms mean, some inspiration videos, and finally what to currently invest in. Truth be told, WallStreetBets is fun but you should stay away from it for long term investments. Short term and stuff like this, well it won't always work but it's fun and you can make money from it. Long term is probably the best option if you are young. Once your in the RobinHood app you'll see how easy it is to actually order a share."

If we bought at $20, $40, perhaps even $80 dollars a few days ago when it went down, it would have been a good investment. People are staying put, they're not buying more. They're just looking to see how high it's going to go before they cash out their already existing positions. I have personally just bought $1300 NOK and I'm looking to cash out of my AAPL position to buy even more. I think that's the next play. But I'm not offering financial advise.

If I wanted to be part of this I would need to buy shares or/and calls of GSE?

 Nokia I feel is a good long term play, same with BB, I sold my amc this morning because I only bought it as a lottery ticket. There are so many posts with only amc/nokia/ some other ticker with rockets and moon.

tdunlapjr,1611765857.0,"From CNBC:

Intensifying speculative behavior among retail investors is causing concern. Heavily shorted names, including GameStop and AMC Entertainment, continued to be pushed higher by amateur day traders in online chat rooms. Some investors are worried about mounting losses by hedge funds spilling over to other areas of the market as those funds sell other securities to raise cash. Investors are also concerned the speculative behavior is a sign the market is overvalued and a pullback is near."

**Press Release**

**Nokia‚Äôs comprehensive C-Band portfolio ready for 5G build-out in U.S.**

* Nokia‚Äôs complete C-Band solutions portfolio available for indoor and outdoor coverage
* Nokia C-Band solutions work across both 5G non-standalone and standalone networks; utilize latest AirScale infrastructure
* C-Band spectrum is a key resource for capacity and coverage capabilities of 5G networks

This deployment flexibility is an important capability as the industry moves towards standalone architecture. The solution leverages Nokia‚Äôs latest AirScale radio access solutions for C-Band.

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) recently completed its C-Band spectrum auction, which received significant interest from mobile operators. The C-Band offers huge capacity scaling and connectivity supporting the increased demand for mobile network capacity. The auctioned spectrum will be cleared for use for 5G services during 2021 and 2022. It is anticipated that the rollout of C"

shR3Dditt,1611766387.0,"Boys we need to focus on liking at most 3 different stocks at a time. 3 million strong can take over the world but not if we are divided up to liking over 10 different stocks.

 Notice how many day 1 or day 2 members we have in here?

Our best chances right now in this order :

1.) GME

2.) AMC

3.) BB

The rest will just slow us down, I know they are cheap but that does not mean we will make the same potential. This is all based off of short interest. Be smart, work together and pick the stocks WE like."

&#x200B;

This London Kings College Economics Professor and Hedge Fund Manager explains what is going on with GME and WSB. His explanation is exactly what I've seen on several DD posts here. 

&#x200B;

BTW, HOLD THE LINE! 

&#x200B;

This is for education and not financial advice, this is a respected economist saying the same things Redditors are saying in DD posts. STONKS TO THE MOON!"

Powergiraffe,1611783674.0,"I don't know. It sounds like you took your cash purchasing power and set a buy order. So from there, that cash purchasing power made from settled liquid cash is sitting in their-yours money market account (it's this account you and etrade share). Inside of that account, your money is on standby to for the purchase price that you set. You probably set it to buy at market price and the market price was too high or you set a limit order bid price and the bid price was just too low so it's waiting. While it's waiting, your cash purchasing power would reflect $0.00. If it's something else entirely then I don't know."

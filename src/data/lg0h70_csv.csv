Head_Paleontologist,1612870846.0,Curious as to what the chain of events is for a CSP to be profitable. I don't really have a grasp of the more complex means of trading options. So you sell a CSP expecting the stock to go up and hold enough money to buy the 100 shares at the price the put is at so when exercised you get shares cheaper than market value?

Wnkmilkme,1612871379.0,"You don't necessarily hope the stock goes up. All it has to do is stay neutral or not come down to your put price. 

But it all depends on how you set it up and how risky you want to make it. If you sell deep OTM weekly puts that you are fairly confident the stock won't come down to that price, all you have to do is wait until Friday, the contracts become worthless and you keep the credit.

The main thing is what OTM puts your going for, meaning how far OTM or how close to ATM they are (basically risk factor). Also make sure you spread it by buying a put same amount for 1 dollar less contract."

dube123,1612872879.0,"Dear Diary,

It’s been 14 days since the apes took over our homeland. I tried fighting back against the onslaught at first, but it proved to be in vain as their numbers just kept increasing. They seem to become more aggressive with time, while showing no visible signs of fatigue. 

After a few days, I made an attempt to find shelter and bunker down. I’ve been in hiding for a little over a week now. It seems they’ve worn themselves out. Most have blown up their accounts but they still linger. Their numbers continue to steadily increase despite no signs of long term survival. Fortunately even with the continued increase in volume, they’re seeming to grow more quiet. 

I woke up early today, in an attempt to assess the damage. They’re still everywhere. Shrieking something about diamond hand and not selling. There’s literal shit everywhere. Nothing is sacred of their footprints. I’m growing weary... afraid. How much longer will I last? I haven’t made contact with any of my fellow autists in over 2 weeks now. I can only hope they are still out there. 

I’ve heard grumbles of a report coming out this afternoon. I can only hope this will be what finally drives them away, so those of us who are left can finally rise up and reclaim our once vibrant and lively home. 

Ps. If you find this, please delete my browser history."

I'm sure it will be in a lot of newcomers' eyes and the mods will eventually cater to the masses. I just miss the vibe of autistic plays and those that suggested them. There were genuinely near genius people on here with a heart of gold underneath all those jokes they use to jab each other's with. 

They were really smart and so modest at the same time. Really willing to help out those that needed them even though they joke this isn't a newbie friendly place I learned and benefited so much being here. Now without having to replay them back, they seem to be all gone :(

Sorry if this sounds selfish but I don't want any active users. I want the community I used to love and cherish back without mods banning mods and having politics and back money on play."

ChadBreeder1,1612873428.0,"There are ways to cut costs and make a lot more of that fryer’s income disposable. I’m not saying it’s fair but it’s possible. As Americans, we all often forget how much money we make (compared to the rest of the world) even at the lowest income levels. The fryer could live in their car and invest all of their money in the market and probably have a nice amount to start a business after ten years. I’m not saying it’s realistic but think of how bad it was in the movie Slumdog Millionaire vs the fryer’s life."

NeuroRx : and Relief Therapeutics Report Initial Phase 2b/3 Study Results Demonstrating Significant Benefit of ZYESAMI™ in Reducing Hospital Stay Among Patients with Respiratory Failure due to Critical COVID-19
02/09/2021 | 07:31am
  

RADNOR, Pa. and GENEVA, Feb. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- NeuroRx, Inc. and Relief Therapeutics Holdings AG (SIX:RLF; OTCQB: RLFTF) today reported preliminary results from the Phase 2b/3 trial of ZYESAMI™ (aviptadil, previously RLF-100) in patients with respiratory failure due to Critical COVID-19. The study showed that patients who were treated with the maximal standard of care plus ZYESAMI benefited significantly from the treatment, compared to those treated with placebo plus maximal standard of care. If authorized for use, ZYESAMI would be the first drug indicated specifically for COVID-19 patients who are critically ill with respiratory failure.

In the study, patients treated with ZYESAMI were discharged earlier from hospital care than those treated with placebo. Among the secondary efficacy endpoints evaluated in patients treated with High Flow Nasal Cannula therapy and with Mechanical Ventilation, there were six of 8 comparisons, all favoring ZYESAMI, resulting in at least a three-day median difference in hospital stay. The likelihood of this constellation of findings being observed by chance was less than 3 in 100 (P<.03). The largest difference observed was among those treated with HFNC who experienced 13 fewer days in ICU (12 vs. 25) and 8 fewer days in hospital (15 vs. 23) (P<.05).

Length of hospital stay was a declared secondary endpoint of the study and previously featured in the granting of drug approval to antiviral drugs in COVID-19, although those drugs were not identified as achieving a difference in outcome among those already in respiratory failure.

With the improvement in survival since the start of the pandemic, differences in survival were not seen at day 28, and patients are being followed through day 60.  The study has not yet determined results for the stated primary endpoint of recovery from respiratory failure and the secondary endpoint data reported today should not create an expectation that the primary endpoint will be met overall or for any subgroup. Study investigators are in the process of confirming the timing of each case of recovery from medical records, following which the study's investigators' committee will review each case prior to unblinded data analysis of this endpoint.

Jonathan Javitt, M.D., M.P.H., CEO of NeuroRx, said: ""We are forever indebted to the study coordinators, nurses, respiratory therapists, and doctors who carried out this study in the midst of a public health calamity that so far has claimed the lives of nearly half a million Americans and millions worldwide.  Our study teams kept the effort going despite contracting COVID themselves, losing family members, and dealing with an unimaginable daily reality. We are greatly encouraged by the outcome of this study. The data provide support for ZYESAMI as a drug that may help get patients home to their families sooner.  The hospitalization data further suggest that patients treated at an earlier stage of illness (i.e. those who can be managed with HFNC) may have a better response to treatment.  We have launched a phase 2/3 trial to explore its inhaled use in patients who are not yet in respiratory failure.  Further study of ZYESAMI's role in critical COVID-19 will be conducted under the BARDA and DOD Medical Countermeasures-funded I-SPY trial.  In addition, we have signed a clinical trial agreement with another federal program the details of which will be announced shortly. We will also report on day 60 survival.

We look forward to discussing with the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory authorities the submission of an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) so that ZYESAMI can be available for treating this population that is at immediate risk of death and for which there is no approved therapy.""

Dr. Javitt added: ""To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of clinically and statistically-significant benefit by any therapeutic agent in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure in a randomized, double-blind, prospective trial.  Other COVID-19 therapeutics have demonstrated clinical advantage in patients with non-critical COVID-19 (ordinal scale 4 and 5) but have not demonstrated benefit in those with Critical COVID-19 (ordinal scale 6 and 7). Steroids have demonstrated benefit in open-label studies.  However, no randomized controlled trial to date has shown efficacy when patients are in respiratory failure and require High Flow Nasal Cannula, Non-invasive ventilation, or Mechanical Ventilation to maintain blood oxygenation. ZYESAMI would be the first drug for such critically ill patients.  Of note, the patients who received either drug or placebo in this trial also received all approved and standard of care treatments including Remdesivir, anti-cytokine drugs, steroids, and anticoagulants."" 

The study, conducted in 10 medical centers, also showed the safety of the drug when administered by intravenous infusion in the ICU.  No drug-related serious adverse events were reported.  The only side effect of note was mild to moderate diarrhea, an expected side effect of ZYESAMI, which was seen in 30% of patients who received the treatment and hypotension, which was seen in.

The data were generated in multicenter clinical trial whose subjects were COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure being treated with the maximal standard of care that included anti-coagulants, steroids, convalescent plasma and antiviral drugs.  The primary endpoint was the resolution of respiratory failure within 28 days after treatment started.  The secondary endpoints were patient survival, time to ICU discharge, time to hospital discharge, time to return to NIAID score of 6-8, and safety."

As a very long term marijuana investor, these companies do NOT currently have any way to sell cannabis in the US.  They are rallying because they are being hyped here, without really understanding why. Real companies that are actually profitable are already selling marijuana in the US, like Trulieve, but they won’t get hyped here because if you’re on Robinhood, you can’t buy them. Please be careful and don’t get hurt investing in things you don’t understand. I love the marijuana sector for the future potential, but just not seeing as much with the Canadian LP’s.

Every single Canadian LP has been focused on one goal for the past few years - gearing up for U.S. legalization. Tilray was setup for this one goal and has been investing heavily in  being on the ground one day of legalization. Same with all the other big Canadian LPs."

If it continues to tank it's at least fun to laugh along with the other idiots.  If it goes back up, well then that's just gravy.

What worries me are people who may be still in it that spent or are continuing to spend money they can't afford to lose on it.  People who jumped on board late thinking this was a magic ticket out of debt.  That's no bueno."

I'm a cheap fuck and always after a deal or chincing on things I don't feel I should be spending full price/name brand on.

But things like shoes (100's of hours spent supporting your ENTIRE body), mattresses (4-8hrs spent on DAILY, even more if you fuck a lot), car tires (only thing keeping you safe between you and the road), chairs (spent 3-12 hours a day in them), monitors (100's hours looking into a panel - should be crisp, clear, rich and cool on the eye) are worth getting new and good quality.

Get what I'm saying?"

Second, TLRY has pretty big news out this morning in case you didn’t know. Momentum is up if you’re a TA guy. Legalization in the US is being speculated on. And I hate to be that guy but a gamma squeeze may very well be taking place because the weeklies only go up to $42. So, depending on how covered the MMs are on the calls they sold they may be forced to cover. In addition, once again hate to be that guy, short interest is up from ~31% to ~52% so shorts may be covering as well. The situation is a lot more dynamic than saying wsb is the cause. Correlation does not equal causation."

Kledd,1612877492.0,"Copy/pasting this from the premarket thread since i didn't get many answers:

Possibly retarded question but are oil companies actually gonna be returning to pre covid levels? Most companies like Shell/BP/Total have already made a decent comeback but are now stagnating pretty far underneath their pre covid price. 

Is this because there's still less travel than before or are new green plans from Biden etc causing it? 

All the sources i can find are disagreeing wildly on when and if it will come back properly, so i just thought I'd ask here in case someone smarter than me has any thoughts."

I’d like three portfolios: one for day trading (penny and meme stocks), one for aggressive mid-term trading (tech and weed), and one for long term investing (blue chips, Apple, Google, Disney, Microsoft).

Can I do this in the same account or do I need to open up three accounts?"

ngh2b,1612877834.0,"You have a few options.

You can hold and hope for the price to rise as the lockdowns lift and the vaccinations prove successful. I doubt we will see the price go up very high as AMC was already hemmoraging money prior to all this; and streaming services along with cheap, big screen tvs have proven to be a comfy replacement. However, you would at least take LESS of a loss.

You can hold it in the hopes of a buyout by another larger company. This is possible in the age of mergers and with so much money flooding the system.

Or, you can hold it until the end of the year, and then take a capital loss that you can then apply against your taxes and capital gains from another investment. This option should at least make you feel less stressed.

Just take the time to do some research. This is coming from someone who is also holding AMC at the moment, so I feel your anxiety. Do not let it get you down, and just find a way to flip it into a win.

Best of luck."

jfwelll,1612878713.0,"Well if its to work its pretty early as they dont move shit right now. 

Was more asking an opinion on growth potential due to having a convenience store investing into them. 

I surely cant tell about how it is everywhere but where i live there is one store (its sqdc here) who is in the same building/ separate doors than a gas station and everytime I went i noticed how many people would go grab a beer, put gasoline and buy some goodies and then would just go get some flower next door. 

My thinking is more going in that way that if, a big company who own a lot of gas stations (at least here) is starting to invest in a company that got the first non-govt licence to sell , I would imagine at some point couche tard would want to replicate the model and have some cannabis stores linked to the convience stores, which is a first in term of making a monopoly an oligopoly and I can see it being profitable in the long run as people like to get everything at the same place. They will also want to try the competitor,  either because its new or when they arent pleased with the govt stores. 

As I said im not so good in analyzing fundamentals and I asked you because you said you followed what was going on so i tought you had an opinion on it because despite looking like nothing its quite a big thing to have the govt giving permit to exploit to anyone actually.

Right now I know they can operate in Ontario. Not sure if other provinces will follow. Pretty sure my province (qc) wont because they like to keep monopoly in these types of things (just like they do with alcool) but if it develops i tought it could have some potential, even if right now their numbers are pretty laughable. 

It may look like stupid thinking but I personnaly saw the growth of couche tard, having a few stores here and there when I was young and now they own so many things.  Maybe im wrong or just very early on something that could grow."

For me, since I want to stay in the position but also welcome a squeeze, I'll be taking the temperature more often than usual  e.g. paying closer attention to this stock and the sentiment surrounding it. I'll do this by keeping an eye on the media, and various other subs. This will give me a sense of the underlying sentiment. Price action, too. Just staying relevant and understanding the attitude around the stock. 


Exits: 

* I'll be looking for organic decline/reversion, organic growth moving forward (no more big spike likes this). I'll stay in under these circumstances.

* I'll be looking out for hype/speculation driven spikes in price. I'll get ready to turn my investment into an active trade. I'll sell where I think it's highest. 


* I'm going to get an ATM weekly call option at open. They're super cheap.



SPECIAL NOTE: this one is tricky since I have positions in both APHA and TLRY. Since they track, I'll lose both investments if it squeezes. Oh well, that's life."

Social_History,1612880531.0,I bought it. Let’s ride. 🚀🚀🚀
orfane,1612880533.0,"Some key points on TLRY/APHA that may be of interest:

* TLRY is currently in a bit of a short squeeze. When TLRY famously shot up to $300 a share, short interest was 33%. It is currently 51%

* TLRY and APHA will be merging this year, keeping TLRY as the ticker. APHA holders will get .84 shares of TLRY for each APHA share they own

* Currently, 84% of TLRY stock price would put APHA at $29 a share, $8 more than its current value. Meaning if you own APHA and the merger happened today you make a free $8 per share

* TLRY/APHA combined will be the largest weedstock company in the world, with footholds in every major market. They have higher sales and a higher market share than CGC, which is currently the highest valued weedstock

* When combined, TLRY will have a market cap of roughly $11 Billion. CGC is currently valued at $16 Billion. So TLRY/APHA combined will be a larger, more profitable company with a lower market cap

* TLRY/APHA to the moon

I just think many people will go just for the impression not buying from the govt, plus the novelty could help the launch but from there it still depends how they do if they want to keep customers and if thats something that may expand. 

As a customer I wish it does as monopolies are never that good. I prefer competition to push back the limits. Time will tell but I will look into it.

They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, their is no other competitors. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs.

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales.

They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, their is no other competitors. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs.

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales.

EOY target is $60

Worst case scenario, closes well above my strike.  I lose the difference.     

Best scenario closes OTM.

ctiller12,1612881858.0," 

Guys here's my DD on container shipping stocks. Simply put buy. Reason being 2020 was one of the most profitable years for this industry there were record numbers of containers being moved around the world. Container organizations like the alliance, which is the largest shipper organization in the world, to smaller organizations like C!T!R!M and ZI!M all made investments to increase those revenues from creating more containers to ordering new ships to going public. 2021 with the reopening of economies and demand for vaccines is going to spike these companies even more. I work for one of these companies Hapag-Lloyd and were getting slammed with orders and revenues on all ends. If HL was traded in the US I would be buying it as well."

Looseseal13,1612882174.0,AMC? Cause they diluted their share pool 75% and have an absolute shit balance sheet... $400 million in cash and $6bn in debt. If you take out the share dilution the stock would be over $15 though so it's still over priced. Also retail is such a small fraction of overall shares. Especially RH and Webull lol.

WallStreetRetardd,1612882221.0,"Here’s some DD on BB

They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, their is no other competitors. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs.

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales.

EOY target is $60

Lets do some backtesting in Thinkorswim and find out

On **March 23** the price of **SPY 3/19/21 $310** strike calls was **2.05**. Lets say we used $20k to buy 100 contracts and hold until expiration.

SPY **3/19 $310** calls are at the ask price of **81.23** which gives us a total value of:

#$812,300

No TA and no DD needed. Invest in a boring index **on a dip** and you can secure your retirement.

Dozens of huge hedge funds bet against Elon Musk since 2013 and they **ALL LOST**.

**The future is electric**, GM announced all vehicles will be electric after 2035 others will follow.

Competition doesn't matter, iPhone is still #1 even after tons of clones from Samsung, China etc.

I read through MGPI's 5 year plan before I bought - which is all about increasing their capacity for aged whiskey products that they resell to other blenders / distillers (like Angel's Envy.) They're about 2 years into it now and you can't accelerate how long it takes to age a barrel of rye or bourbon, so I'm long on them.

Maybe I should write a DD once this GME stuff dies down."

Also as a constant reminder to NEVER BE THIS STUPID AGAIN. That said, I love this sub. I mean, the basic concept. I’m glad I came here. I came to stay. I’ll do my own proper DD from now on and do more stupid shit (just maybe not as stupid as buying GME at over $300, while it is on its way down and then holding it to far below $60) and I’m all game.

Luckily for you you’ve likely got the 2/19 calls since weeklies weren’t a thing with CRSRso you got time to catch up."

TorontoCPAinvestor,1612884122.0,"Just added $10K to $APHA (on top of my already 7,000 shares).

The squeeze on $TLRY will be EPIC:

$APHA catalysts: 

1. Merger w TLRY
2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 20-25% at present

UP TO $300!!!!!

Do your own DD!!!!

NotThatSpecialToo,1612884316.0,"One guy had been watching GME since March 2020 (DFV).

he posted in defense of GME repeatedly and was mercilessly made fun of.

Fast forward to GME starting to go up and his calls started paying.

Others in the forum took notice both to DFV's gain porn in addition to the once-in-a-lifetime SHort interest on an obviously failing company and saw an opportunity.

The smart people bought it at .50 and sold at l;east half their shares/options at $400 while convincing others to ""buy and hold"" in a play to secure profits.

Some people took their windfall from selling at $400 and rebought at lower prices to gamble on a second short squeeze (gamble is still kind of on really). They continue to scream ""HOLD"" while hoping the 25% of profits they gambled (fronm the rise to $400) lead to another mooning (if not they already are in the green by selling at $400).

ANd we come to today and the hopes of the SI report from after close this evening to show over 100% short interest still.

If the SI report this evening shows low SI then expect a MASSIVE sell-off tomorrow where bagholders realize they are bagholders and take the losses.  


Most of the bagholders are starting to realize random people on the internet are not the best place to get stock advice and when a forum tells you they are degenerate gamblers, GME bagholders will totally believe it next time :)  


Current Position: GME bagholder ROFL"

MrGrampton,1612884481.0,"on 11 Feb we'll see if they are starting to turn a profit.

There is definitely a negative connotation attached to ACB bc of past false financial claims, and other moves that wasn't investor-friendly. I do think they could potentially turn a profit in the long run, but that is if they don't go bankrupt before that.

Right now, their new CEO is doing extreme cost cutting and I think they might be looking into some partnerships (idk for sure)

What about US legalization? Well if Aurora cannot handle sales within their own country, how can they expand? They need to turn up a profit in order to expand, biggest problem they have rn is to get rid of their accumulating debt and go into positive.

Though it may look bad for the company, I believe they can turn up a profit and this Thursday is going to be a test whether that's true or not. I put 30 shares on them cause I'm poor but still"

The squeeze on $TLRY will be EPIC:

$APHA catalysts:

1. Merger w TLRY
2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 20-25% at present"

&#x200B;

(GME) Just think about it logically.

These people hate us. They despise us and our low status. We are ants  for the crushing. They would never “let” us win one. They have been  insulted by our huberus. They are threatened by our collective strength.  They formed alliances to ensure their victory. They made deals for  others to take losses on their behalf. They cannot be allowed to lose.  They will not play fair. They think they can make deals to help  manipulate the price so that their cohorts can make money in both  directions. They have hedged their losses. They think they have  subverted our influence through media propaganda. They are STILL  EXPOSED.  They NEED OUR SHARES. They have until Valentines Day to settle  up before the SI report goes public and the world finds out they are  MORE EXPOSED than ever before. HOLD THE LINE! Squeeze begins soon.

$APHA catalysts:

1. Merger w TLRY
2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 20-25% at present

Make plays to take advantage of this absurd bull market, BUT make sure you have a plan for when the crash happens. Also be prepared for a prolonged period of flat. You can buy puts in anticipation of a major crash, but a long flat period can fuck your calls and your puts.  
Mainly I just have a bunch in standard index funds, a tidy sum of cash, and then I'm blasting off with OTM calls.  
My options will be worthless in a crash or flat period, but I can weather it with my index shares and buy some more with the cash. And if the ridiculous bull market lasts a little longer, I'll have made enough on my stupid options plays that I won't care about losing the ones open when the crash comes."

Sure some people get lucky, like I remember Zoom last year had one that was insane, also calls and puts tend to get IV crush after earnings so that's another reason not to hold through unless you have shares or calls much further out."

sierra120,1612885855.0,"What’s changed when you bought?

If you bought a farm for $100,00 and your neighbor walks over to you and offers you $120,000 do you sell? You told him nah I just bought it I see a little bit more value. He comes back the next day and tells you he’ll give you $90k. Then the next day $85k then the next day $75k. Everyday he’s coming to you with lower and lower prices... $50k, $40k, $30k. Now He’s offering you $20k. Do you sell? What changed? Your farms the same right, same foundation, same weather, only difference now is your neighbor is lowering his bid prices at you. 

Answer this, who’s the crazy one in this story?

meritorius_demotion,1612886169.0,That'd be a very fair price. Expect gme price to decay similar to stocks like hertz as its being melted down via options. You might want to start buying in at tranches of 40 35 etc. To guarantee a buy as it'll pop randomly just like kodak/hertz and other heavily shorted stocks that had a huge price rise on news

4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)

They only transferred about 173 that I had just sitting around (After the 75 fee). I'm on hold with Fidelity, and the fidelity sub is filled with RH horror stories about RH's illegal practices with transfers and failed transfers.

JOHNSNW19,1612888969.0,"A STUDY IN CANNABIS OPPORTUNITIES: Started discussing a few weeks ago when the stock was .25

PART1 **TRTC** 🚀🚀🚀**TRTC**: Was the first cannabis company to go public back in 2012, they went on a tear until the Canadian market launched a ton of competitors. Currently they have a $50 MKT CAP with COVID behind them they should be able to get back to at least a $20M revenue run rate. Major shareholders have lockups at .30 cents. Most interesting though is the company invested into HydroFarm (**HYFM**) Nasdaq for $5 million a couple years ago. HYFM just went public last December currently trading over $80 a share. Terra Tech **TRTC** has 600,00 shares and 300,00 warrants with a $16.85 strike price. Combined that's close to $70 Million in value. AGAIN the company has a $50 Million market cap and owns $70 Million of **HYFM** stock not to mention their retail and cultivation assets in CA and NV. IMHO it's only a matter of time before the market realizes the arbitrage. Already **TRTC** stock ran from .07 to .30 but there is still upside from my perch. And this stock has a history of trading into the $5.00 area. With cannabis legalization on plate there are several catalysts.

&#x200B;

In addition there is a high probability that the feds will work to pass laws favorable to cannabis this year.

Good trading you TARDS!!!!

DIAMONDS ARE MY HANDS 💎🙌 .....

PART 2: Kushco **KSHB** coming soon.

Since the company is doing so well the price is going up along with legalization in the US on the way plus merger with aphria. Because of all this great news the attention of big institutional investors is being caught. If these big institutional investors start hopping on board while there is a 55% short interest with the influx of retail traders buying in being an added bonus, a short squeeze might happen. Regardless the company is successful and has great potential heading into the future. If a short squeeze happens it is because their success is gaining them big investors while they have a high short interest percentage."

I’ve been bullish and playing TLRY since it was $9. TLRY has been making subtle jumps the deeper we were getting into a majority blue government. Now news is hitting about TLRY authorizations and partnerships, along with decriminalization and as far as possible legalization in the US. All of that on top of APHA merger.

TLRY is not spiking because of a squeeze right now. Yeah, short interest is building up, sure it might squeeze. But TLRY is genuinely building up value.

At some point over the next year COVID restrictions on evictions/foreclosures are going to be a thing.  Now because housing prices have gone up so much people who are behind on their mortgages should be able to sell rather than get foreclosed on at least at first.  It is hard to say if this will even things out and cause prices to stabilize or if we will see a fall.

COMBINED REVS $950M CAD

CURRENTLY TRADING AT A COMBINED MARKET CAP OF $17B CAD

REVENUE GROWTH HAS BEEN 130% Y.o.Y avg

US ISNT EVEN LEGALZED YET

APHA OWNS 20% OF CANADA MARKET SHARE

APHA and TLRY have markets in the UK, EU, South Americas, Canada, and US. US is the next big market to open up and will increase revenues massively once legalized.APHA is set to have $5B revenues \*\*\*WITHOUT\*\* any catalysts as it stands. With major legalization like EU and US APHA is set to become a 50b revenue company in the next 10 years.

ddonovan86,1612890964.0,"*Dumb Question Incoming!* (Please don't yell at me)

I am interested in entering this wild game. Gambling is fun, but stocks have always appeared to be gambling out of my depth. The developments of 2021 seem like an invitation to participate. 

I do not typically have excess funds to lose, and I'm still in credit card debt and have a mortgage to pay. Fortunately, those debts are well on track to being handled. This allows for a new opportunity to take a chunk of cash from my upcoming bonus to blow on stocks. Ideally, the plan is to put a thousand dollars in to the market across a handful of stocks and just play it out. The goal is more about learning than earning a profit.

**My Question Is:** Does the current market and trading app fees allow for me to play the game without losing money beyond my initial investment? Like, even if I am legit the worst investor possible and all my stocks become worthless, I have still only lost that initial thousand dollars, right?  
Huge thank you to anyone who takes the time to help a rookie out!"

TorontoCPAinvestor,1612891138.0,"Degenerates. I have been on r/weedstocks for years and held/holding $APHA for years!

This will be the global leader in weed. Many Catalysts:

 

1. Merger w TLRY
2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 20-25% at present

Now, $TLRY is going through a SQUEEZE. GME #2... Shorts are SCARED:

Why?

Because that's what is worth.  It's a dying business who only got this life injected into it by becoming the most shorted stock around.  

A million idiots have the ability to create a squeeze,  and we did.  A historic squeeze that likely would have continued had it not been for the involvement of robinhood and other brokers. 

But

They did it,  and with the first dips,  the end of the squeeze was solidified.  Now,  they have transferred a large enough portion of their bag to legitimate retards who insist gme is a worthwhile company (the same retards who collectively hated gamestop as a company for 5 years prior to this thanks to their shady business practices,  cheap attitude,  and hostile work environment).

Now that the losses are raining down on you,  your peers WILL begin to sell their heavy bags at ridiculous losses. 

Those of you who insist on holding like the Facebook follower bandwagoners you are,  will dwarf their losses with your own until you finally realize what an idiot you were and sell just to have literal beer money for the night. 


Meanwhile,  those of us who were smarter,  bought 10 dollar puts a week ago and will just watch our accounts grow.

They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, their is no other competitors. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs.

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales.

cazzo_di_frigida,1612891599.0,"If the merger happens, APHA stocks become .82 for every share of TLRY which is basically free money since the difference between the two is hovering around .5/.6 at the moment (obviously that could change). APHA already owns an American company (Sweetwater Brewing) which gives them expedited access to the US cannabis market. So even if the merger doesn't happen, APHA will be ahead of the game when the US legalizes cannabis, which is going to happen. It's just a matter of when.

Also the CEO of Aphria is going to be taking over as the CEO of Tilray once the merger happens and he seems to be more favorable in the eyes of investors as opposed to the current CEO of Tilray. 

It is important to note that Aphria is buying Tilray. They are just keeping the Tilray name because they have more brand recognition."

The Fremont, Calif.-based company earned an adjusted 53 cents a share on sales of $556.3 million in the December quarter. Analysts expected Corsair earnings of 46 cents a share on sales of $528 million. On a year-over-year basis, Corsair earnings rose 152% while sales climbed 70%.

For 2021, Corsair expects revenue of $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion. The midpoint of $1.875 billion would represent a 10% increase over 2020 sales. Analysts had predicted 2021 sales of $1.72 billion.

Smith Falls, Ontario-based Canopy posted a net loss of C$829 million ($650.9 million), or C$2.43 a share, for the quarter to Dec. 31, wider than the loss of C$109.6 million, or 26 cents a share, posted in the year-earlier period. The FactSet consensus was for a loss of 32 cents a share. Revenue net of excise taxes rose to C152.5 million from C$123.8 million, above the FactSet consensus of C$149.8 million.

Its_the_dankness,1612892288.0,"Oh sure, and that's a fair assessment, and to be fair the CNBC article I read actually used the term ""pot"" but marijuana is also viewed negatively within the cannabis industry. From Harborside, a long time operating California based dispensary explaining why they sparingly use the term ""marijuana"":

> We prefer to use the word cannabis, because it is a respectful, scientific term that encompasses the many different uses of the plant.  
>  
>The word “marijuana” or “marihuana” is an emotional, pejorative term that has played a key role in creating the negative stigma that still tragically clings to this holistic, herbal medicine. Most cannabis users recognize the “marijuana”  as offensive, once they learn its history.  
>  
>The “marijuana” term began as a Mexican folk name for cannabis, but was first popularized in the U.S. by the notorious yellow press publisher, William Randolph Hearst. Hearst was a racist, as well as being committed to the prohibition of marijuana, which threatened his timber investments. He used his control of hundreds of newspapers to orchestrate a vicious propaganda campaign against cannabis, which featured lurid (and false) stories about black and brown men committing outrageous acts of murder and mayhem.  
>  
>That campaign played on then-predominantly racist public opinion to make cannabis illegal at the federal level in 1937. Since then, “marijuana” has come to be associated with the idea that cannabis is a dangerous and addictive intoxicant, not a holistic, herbal medicine for helping people deal with the effects of cancer, AIDS, wasting syndrome and other conditions. This stigma has played a big part in stymying cannabis legalization efforts throughout the U.S.  
>  
>Language is important because it defines our ideas. Words have a power that transcends their formal meaning. When we change words, we can also change the thoughts that underlie them. By changing the words we use to describe cannabis and herbal medicine, we can help our fellow citizens understand the truth about it, and see through the decades of propaganda.  
>  
>That understanding will convert cannabis opponents into supporters, and bring closer the day when all our prisoners go free, and nobody else is ever again arrested for using or possessing “marijuana.”"

They will continue to go up. Just buy and hold till at least June for merger. If we pass legalization these will print hard even after then. So dont sell if youre buying for quick gains.

liquor_for_breakfast,1612892606.0,"I miss the olden days of like 2 months ago, when we could call each other the worst of names without snowflakes getting upset. When we would bet against each other and talk shit about the other's position knowing we might both lose it all to theta gang, who would then shit talk us both. When we would have a rotation of meme stocks instead of just one. When we would all play weekly options and laugh at the occasional newbie who played an earnings report and just learned about IV crush the hard way. When we made fun of people for having small accounts and being poor, and had exactly 0 respect for paper trading. When a YOLO post was 5+ figures into FDs instead of 50 bucks into a partial Amazon share. When anyone suggesting blue chips or index funds would be mercilessly ridiculed and banned.

Yes I own shares in the current meme, but I've had them more than a week or two, making it a long-term position that has no business here anymore. I also have retirement accounts with responsible long-term investments, but I don't talk about those here because that's not what wsb is for. I talk about my gambling account with its irresponsibly high risk but potentially stupidly high reward lottery ticket plays.

I miss shit talking hedge funds and investment banks but everyone actually wanting to work for them, instead of some fucking commie wealth redistribution mindset. I miss people wanting to get rich for the sake of being rich, to join the elite instead of having some half baked plan to bring them all down to our level in a single short squeeze. Wanting a yacht full of hookers and blow, instead of hating the mere fact that people like that exist. I MISS PEOPLE UNDERSTANDING AND PARTICIPATING IN CAPITALISM.

But mostly I just miss having fun here."

mountaingoatsclimb,1612894101.0,Bought 250 shares of VGAC. 23andme is going to explode and now’s the time to buy in before there stock ticker changes to “ME”. Only $14.50 today and this has easy potential to double in Q2 once people realize VGAC has officially switched to the 23andme name and they have the largest collection of genetic data. Their consumer business isn’t the play. Think about the value they have in the healthcare industry with genetic data on 15 million people.

They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, their is no other competitors. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs.

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales.

But in my personal experience just yolo-ing around and messing with a few call and put options last year, buying a few stocks I didn't see many gains, was up around 20% playing it safe. I got in on the GME train early, last October. 27 shares netted me $2300 in gains. I put those into weed stocks last week and my portfolio is now up 143% all time. I started in late 2019. Its part luck/timing and part doing your own research and just spending time being in the market. If you feel safe losing a grand, go for it. God knows I've lost 500-700 on slot machines many many times before I got into investing/WSB. I've also hit some real good jackpots along the way. So far this has been my favorite Casino."

Its_the_dankness,1612895020.0,"Shit you are right, 

"" 

1. Acquire a contract or option to buy substantially identical stock or securities.

What this means for the stock and options trader is that if you take a loss on a stock or an option and then buy back that same stock, or an option on that same stock, whether the option is the same month and strike price or not, you have a wash sale. The same holds true if you close an option position for a loss and then buy the same underlying stock within the 30 day window. There is no clarification in the tax law as to how far ""in or out of the money"" the option is, or what month and year the option expires. So TradeLog simply applies this rule as follows: If the underlying stock is the same, then the option is ""substantially"" the same. For details see our Chart of Wash Sale Triggers section below."""

You'd have to adjust for # of shares issued etc, but once the contract is in the market, it could be traded like any other security and whoever owned it at ipo time would receive the share.

chetpancakesparty,1612896578.0,"$MRO time. Crude prices have been in a very high incline for three months now and $MRO earnings are 2/17.

12,913 contracts of 3/19/21 $13 calls were bought this morning. This is truly insane.

There has been a rotation back in to oil/energy stock as crude prices have risen but I don't think we've seen anything yet.

$XOM just had a big OTM call buy block as well.

Unlike Melvin that was short probably a good 100% of float, the short sellers now are probably numerous and got plenty of cash. Besides, that was from the 29 settlement date (T+2), so... price crashed more than 80% they must have taken their quick money by now xd

Shorting up there was free money, but at lower prices not as much so I guess, this is my opinion, SI will be much lower with the next report."

It was so bad one company returned a half ton of product as unsellable due to I think it was mold or something like that. That represented 10% of total sales for the quarter. They then failed to report this to shareholders and got a firestorm of class action lawsuits filed against them. The stock hasn't ever recovered since that and I haven't really payed much attention to it after I cut out when the whole bombshell was reported.

A call is just a contract that if you do buy it will give you the *right* to buy a 100 shares of that particular stock at the price that the call says.  

The idea behind it is that if you are long on a company, and you wanna bet it will reach a certain value by a certain time (that's the important thing about options, they're time-dependant as you're betting it will hit that price by that time or before).  

If you have the capital to buy the 100 shares at that particular price that the contract is for, you can see how worthy it is if let's say the current price of the stock rose much higher above that price.  

You'll be getting one hell of a discount.  

Most traders and autists around here don't wait to execute a contract, in this case a call options contract.  

We would rather buy the contract, and sell it again at some point before the expiration date. If the stock has been steadily rising or just had a crazy quick upshot, that contract that you bought might be worth much more. If you sell it, that's you selling the contract for the premium's profit.  

You can't lose more than what you put in if you're playing with your own money, i.e. not on margin as far as I know.  

Hope this helps a bit, you might be able to figure the rest from here reading more about it yourself!"

Do I think some tickers are highly overvalued? Of course. A lot of value is currently undervalued in favor of growth stocks though. 

Rates are shit. Bonds are shit. 

Where else would anyone put cash?

Tendie_rizer,1612900561.0,Roth IRA u can contribute up to 6k a year with post tax dollars. Everything you earn on that money in that account when u get to retirement is tax free. U can also withdraw your contributions (6000 or whatever u contribute to it over the years). Yes buying etfs is safer but if u find something u like long term it’s a good place to buy because gains are tax free. And as I said u can take out ur contributions for free but why would u wanna do that! We want that to compound over time!

 $APHA is the way to go - this is NOT a pump stock; MANY catalysts to come:

1. Merger w TLRY
2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 20-25% at present

They are the forefront in the AI Autonomous cyber security software market, their is no other competitors. Partnerships with the 19 of the top 25 EV companies which make up 61% of the EV market. Not to mention the recent deal with ticker: BIDU to provide their QNX System to over 175 million EV’s. They’ve successfully moved on from their product sales of phones and at most majority of revenue comes from the software they provide to homes, stations, and EVs.

They have completely wiped their department, obviously bringing in the Almighty papa chen who’s know for reviving software companies and who also announced today they signed a contract to provide power and cyber security to ISS for the next moon landing.

If you look at the analytics of their department, they revamped the company completely. By browsing linkedin they have a 3:1 ratio of engineers to sales, which means they are keen on developing their product and not so worried about sales.

SnooPuppers2489,1612973381.0,"LMAO so we get a short report that says a company is shorted close to 80% still, the FTD rate on the stock is insane, there’s still mad institutions buying into it, but we need to ban GME talk? Even threads with good DD? If we can’t post about GME outside this thread, and there are no more daily threads, you’re basically saying you’re banning GME talk altogether right? That’d be verrrrrry convenient for y’all, it would make everyone you burned and who saw the coup leave the sub right so they can’t speak about these issues anymore? Okay mate 😂

EDIT: Also; what are you basing the assumption it’ll go to being a penny stock on? There’s nothing that says it will, so why bring it up unless you’re trying to convince people that it could go down that far. Why are you trying to suggest that’s possible with no data to back it up? I see ya 👀"

SnooPuppers2489,1612978423.0,Damn maybe they shouldn’t have lied to the Admins saying that zjz caused too much instability after they took over the sub and kicked him out. You’d think that they’d need him to help moderate the huge influx of users.... but I guess it was easier for them to throw him under the bus and then pretend nothing happened.

I have so many screenshots and screen recordings from that night, nobody’s gonna convince me or anyone else who tried to bring this up that we’re crazy, sorry man but nice try.

Proof the mod list was full of minute old accounts:

Flying_madman,1612982385.0,"Well yeah, I'm aware of what happened but, unless you've been sleeping off having stayed up that late, you should have noticed that all the ""new"" mods got purged by the admins and the OGs are back (*sans* zjz, who sacrificed himself for the greater good).

You don't need to tell me twice that the coup attempt (this was the second one, actually, zjz blew the lid off the last one too, and lost an entire account in the process) was bad news and that we're still dealing with the aftermath, but don't lump Opinion, Chainsaw, 1/Ryan, and the rest in with the bad ones. I can even vouch for Beavers and Vacation but I don't know them as well. I have no idea about DoucheCanoe, but if the rest vouch for him he's all right in my book. 

AutoMod can get rekt, though. (JK, <3 U AutoMod, don't sticky all over my posts)"

I know the old mods got let back in. That doesn’t change the fact that since this happened, this sub has devolved into a cesspool of [removed], even when it’s good DD. The fact that zjz isn’t allowed to come back and these mods said we have to wait 6 MONTHS to message them about it means that we aren’t all back to rainbows and daisies.

And also who cares, I’m talking about the fact that douche canoe is able to just be like “okay, no more GME posts ever now, thanks!” And he’s “vouched for”? LMAO"

dilleyf,1611821682.0,"no problem man

how ya looking with GME currently? i’ve been reading the discussion thread and i think it’s gonna boom at open haha"
gnomekingdom,1611822029.0,"I didn't go in on GME. I went in on AMC with 100 shares this morning. Buying into GME at mid-300 wouldn't net me much because I had limited capital to put in. I thought if I catch a break and AMC rockets, I might get a bigger return out of 100 shares. AMC is the 3rd of the top 3 being shorted. 
Makes me sick. I could've bought in at 87 but I'm new, I'm intimidated, and a big smooth-brained donk. I went AMC so I wouldn't make another mistake....which it may very well have been.
But I'm in full stop with the cause."
dilleyf,1611822172.0,"good shit man!

fortunately i actually got into AMC @ $4

— and yeah, GME is getting to the point where the price is so high that it’s becoming harder for more people to get in i think :-/"

gnomekingdom,1611827882.0,"Pre-market open! Yeah, started off on the-commodity-that-shall-not-be-named but ryhmes with ""hip-toe"" and learned the elementary school basics. Then I realized how volatile it was. Had me stressed. Lost my ass in “Ex Are Pee” and now I’m done with it. The first advice given to me from Reddit was 403b advice and to invest in FBGKX and VTSAX as long term growth. 
Best advice I ever got. EVER! (Doubled my retirement in 5 months.) Then they sent me here. In between all the chaos you get lucky and you get people like yourself looking out for people like me. Can’t thank you and the others enough for the guidance. I’m here for the long haul. 🚀💎🚀💎🚀💎
And I'm changing my mind.....I'm waiting for the GME dip at opening and I'm going for 3 shares."
dilleyf,1611828258.0,"(in PST, my time) i think the price will dip between 7 to 7:30 AM, definitely try to buy around there if you see a significant dip. and sorry to hear about your experience with EX ARE PEE, but hopefully $GME will make up for it !

and i definitely need to look into FBGKX and VTSAX then because that’s a new one for me"
gnomekingdom,1611829087.0,"Thank you for the condolences. As we do, I knew the risk- so I had to learn to stop sitting on the lump in my pants and get off the bus. Or something like that. ???
FBGKX for the win, my dude. It has been for me. This time last year I was sitting at a turd-less than 100k at the Covid crash. Now I'm whispering in the ear of 200k like it's a sexy donkey. VTSAX is good but not the growth FXBGK has had. Most of Fidelity's blue chip growth funds have been performing nicely all around. Something to chew on when you have time. Now, moving forward like a retard on a rocket, I'm looking for the dip here in EST so that'll be 10-1030 my time, so post market opening? Can't sleep. This might be game changing for me."

MortyXD,1611849997.0,"GUYS Every single dip is caused by a mass selloff.

It's not WSB selling. Even if we were, it wouldn't make a BLIP in the share price.

DeepFuckingValue could sell right now and it wouldn't make a blip.

These dips are caused by the shorts trying to tank the price. They are selling borrowed shares. Again. To each other. They are doubling down. They are trying to scare you into selling.

Every share they sell is borrowed. It has to be repaid. They will need to buy it back and repay it.

Every dip is just another rise waiting to happen.

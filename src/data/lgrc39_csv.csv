Everyone. DO NOT SLEEP on GSAT. 250 Million volume yesterday. Over 100,000 Calls purchased. Gamma squeeze is IMMINENT. HUGE news:

Globalstar, Inc. (NYSE American: GSAT) (""Globalstar"" or the ""Company"") today announced that Qualcomm Inc. has included Globalstar's Band n53 in its new 5G X65 modem. The X65 is Qualcomm's flagship 5G modem and adds global 5G band support for n53. With Qualcomm's support the potential device ecosystem expands significantly to include the most popular smartphones, laptops, tablets, automated equipment and other IoT modules.

This will be worth 20 billion dollars once Apple Iphones start using the band since they use qualcomm. $50 by end of year. 5G is the future."

PLTR will be massive because big data is still the future. I know the era of big data is here, but we are in the infancy phases still. AI and big data will allow PLTR to become the massive dystopian corporation that we all fear."

Nemo-pluribus-unum,1612957066.0,"I'm surprised no one here talks about undervalued stocks like Autonation here. It looks very interesting on a macro, but also on a stock specific level:

->macro play (real asset), inflation protection
->11million immigrants (a fraction of it that will now be eligible to apply for a drivers licence)
->potential for car subsidies in Biden infrastructure bill
->further stimulus for low income segment expected
->shortage in chips for car producers (supply shortage)
->new website (e-commerce)
->massive potential for operational leverage//smaller asset depreciation due to higher turnover rate (pent-up demand, stimulus, e-commerce)
->partnership with Waymo (google)
->very cheap in comparison to other competitors

What am I missing?"

I'm fairly certain what they are doing is the future, but, you know, it all depends on whether they can deliver on their projects. What's more, at least some of their current projects most likely aren't ones that will fill their balance up to the max.  


It can certainly work out, they have good affiliations and great know how, but I'm reluctant"

You know, hope is fading, at the very least for GME (am still very bullish on AMC).

I feel like that's the sentiment going around. People losing hope, people being driven closer to the edge of selling. If that happens, it will well and truly be over.

Me, personally, **I'm not fucking selling**. It's really not worth it for me at this point.

I still believe - and the data suggests the same - that it's possible for another, maybe even a bigger, short squeeze to happen. And it might happen as soon as next week. It might also happen later. Or it might never happen. And the chances of it never happening are increasing the more people are losing hope, are resigning, are selling.

I'll keep my ![gif](emote|wsb_emojis|diamond-hands)![gif](emote|wsb_emojis|richie-with-hands) even in possible defeat.

Edit: People seem to be misunderstanding what I'm saying. I'm not holding because of mere hope. You should never stake your investments or bets on hope or fear alone, always try to assess what's realistic."

They're  a key supplier to TSM, who just committed to spending billions on capital equipment upgrades.  Who are they gonna buy equipment from?  Not hard to put 2+2 together here.

Oh yeah, TSM and Apple just partnered to build OLED displays.  Guess who has products for OLED displays?  AMAT.

The apes are young, against the system and poor, so to regain liquidity they will sell their remaining shares in GME and invest them in a, for them, perfectly fitting asset class, called ""cannabis"".

At the same time, a bubble with patterns similar to those already seen in GME will emerge in the cannabis market. It will last 1-2 weeks and catch many investors on the wrong foot - most likely the GME-Apes again."

BofA released price target of 20 AFTER the hindenburg report and SEC investigation. They agree with Chamath and Clover that it’s all routine and the report was just a hit piece. 

Stock has so much potential. Medicare partnership with Walmart and CVS, and future potential drop it Medicare age eligibility (or hell, Medicare for all?). Plus their tiny overhead (it’s a tech company in a world of old school insurance companies) easily will allow them to outcompete giants like Humana. I see this as a retirement stock. Buy shares and forget you have them, one day they could be worth hundreds if the company takes its place as it should.

whereismynut,1612959533.0,"Search up grow healthy, sunterra, or any dispensary and the corporation that owns that particular business. More than likely they have low valued stocks that have insane upside in the next couple of years. Those first two companies also have a good position for delivery in medical marijuana. I know cause i recently did the DD Cause I applied for a card recently. (Was given good advise to invest on the next trends) 

Florida is getting close to pushing weed for recreational use. Probably can be huge for all the dispensaries in FL and even bigger for states that are pushing for medical marijuana like Georgia or other states that border us. (More convenient to outsource a company thats already well positioned. shit happens a lot down here with work in general, you get a lot of ppl from georgia coming here or vice versa. I know for a fact cause my dads whole line of work in the movie industry involves looking for work in other states. In fact you can apply for a medicle card in youre a seasonal resident meaning you just have to live in FL consecutively for 30 days or somethin) the point is that when these states open up medical weed who are they gonna hire to deliver or even cultivate? Sure a company will start up and have to grind it out but there are monopolies in this business that at times don’t necessarily have such a direct impact on smaller business. (Future investing). more importantly what im hopefull in seeing  is a larger merged company that operates throughout the southeast that is responsible for the distribution or cultivation of the stuff.  (fl,ga,...etc)  Keep an eye on them!

Let me know if yall wanna see any positions or if you have any info regarding my dd you’d share with me.

I appreciate you guys a lot."

I stopped waking up at 4am every day to drool over futures...I cut down on addy...I started working out again...cooking, reading, etc etc

Started trading again about a month ago with a clear mind -- avoided weeklies entirely -- and my account will open at $90k today ($70k of that in last month). Taking it all to cash today cause I can feel greed getting the best of me and slipping into old habits

mtheddws,1612959756.0,"From what I've read, 78% and 42% are using the same maths but perhaps different float figures. 

61 million/226%, you get the float they used to get 226% as 27 million. So, 21m/27m = 78%. 

And when we take 21 million and divide it by the float we see from different sources of around 47-50million, we get a short % of 42-44%.

So it could be two different floats being used. What the fuck do I know, though."

Short interest is no longer a good indicator.  To create a new short squeeze would require driving it up to probably a 300 dollar range and new shorts are probably very deep in the money and will probably close if it gets any where out of the money because they've learnt from the past.

Indeed, the Apes are still in denial in the daily, and here I am considering yoloing 2dte sndl or some shit called huge, damn them, damn them all to hell. 

Thankfully, one kind autist posted information about the UFO etf, a space etf with interesting holdings, many of which may overlap with my love, Cathy Ark's, overhyped space etf. Video games, weed, there's only one place left to go. 

Will the dip and/or crash foreseen by the fourteen year old bears come to pass? Will jpow send the market into a downward spiral when he speaks today? Should I wait until jpow flaps his gums or buy immediately at open? Should I trade during today's staff meeting, which overlaps with market opening, or find the will to stop staring at my phone?

Expecting it? Yyyyyep. 

Worried? Nnnnope. 

Unlike the other weed stonks, my position is in the one that was under a dollar a week or so ago, and is now over $2.00. 

If I see a massive sell off, I could:

A. Follow suit, take the profits and buy back in immediately after, but buy back more shares the I currently possess. 

B. If the sell off isn’t more than 20%, simply add more to my position at a discount. 

With the new administration, Weed stonks & green energy stocks are like herpes(without the herpes itself).

Stock has so much potential. Medicare partnership with Walmart and CVS, and future potential drop it Medicare age eligibility (or hell, Medicare for all?). Plus their tiny overhead (it’s a tech company in a world of old school insurance companies) easily will allow them to outcompete giants like Humana. I see this as a retirement stock.

Legal alternatives are always preferable to black market alternatives for most consumers (alcohol and tobacco are examples). The tech isnt unique in Marijuana so whoever wins is whoever is largest. CBD is the real innovation though, that stuff legit works.

Black market will shrink over time. There arent too many rum runners left despite alcohol being easy to make it's not worth the penalties if caught. Ease of access for distribution is important and i like the apha/til plan long term

Drugs have historically made people a fuck ton of money (pablo escobar, el chapo, the sackler family). This is the one drug pretty much everyone does and doesnt do near the harm.

In my town there is a dispensary on every street corner since medicinal legalization

Time-Elephant92,1612964279.0,"I’m thinking anything under 15 (20 if you hold the year or more) is a steal. BofA released price target of 20 AFTER the hindenburg report and SEC investigation. They agree with Chamath and Clover that it’s all routine and the report was just a hit piece.

Stock has so much potential. Medicare partnership with Walmart and CVS, and future potential drop it Medicare age eligibility (or hell, Medicare for all?). Plus their tiny overhead (it’s a tech company in a world of old school insurance companies) easily will allow them to outcompete giants like Humana. I see this as a retirement stock. Buy shares and forget you have them, one day they could be worth hundreds if the company takes its place as it should.

CorrineontheCobb,1612964841.0,"APHA/TLRY are up because of an expected merger being finalized.

SNDL is up because if it stays up over $1 after EoD Friday, it'll get to stay listed on the market. Also, it's leadership turned around and has been making a good effort of making the company profitable and better organized. 

Also, these weed stocks are all going up because it's expected that the demoncrat led senate is going to legalize it on the federal level.
Therefore, *all* of these stocks are expected explode in growth as drugs and alcohol businesses not only tend to survive in recessions, but actually thrive in them so they're a safe long term bet as well.

Hope that sums it up!"

short term i believe it will go sideways, spikes between 30 and 60 but mostly staying around 40~50, even if there is potential for another squeeze i think it will get shutdown, i doubt wallstreet would allow it to go to 400 again any time soon

long term i think the DD is still the same [gmedd.com](http://gmedd.com), wouldnt leave too much on it though, i think its better to let the dust settle before putting any meaningful money on the long play

Mrhipposause,1612965818.0,"RSI= Relative Strength Index 

Basically all you need to know is when a stock is around 30% RSI it is usually **undersold** and could mean that the price will go up as people buy into the stock more. 

When a stock is around 70% RSI it is usually **oversold** meaning the price could drop as people sell the stock back into the market.

lurkwhenbored,1612966239.0,"# Market arbitrage play with APHA and TLRY

##TLRY go up because weed deal in UK and other news
##TLRY do reverse merger with APHA

“Under terms of the merger deal, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share they own, while Tilray shareholders will see no adjustment to their holdings.”

##APHA should be worth 83% of TLRY instead of being valued at about 46% of TLRY 

APHA = 30 CAD = 23 USD
(23 / 50) = 0.46

So the difference between the two is the profit made (50 - 23 = 27) multiplied by the share given (0.83) (27 * 0.83 = 22.41)

# Guaranteed $22.41 USD per share of APHA at current prices"

I’m disgusted at what this sub has become. The first and only rule of wsb is to make money. I can’t believe what I’m witnessing. There was a front page post yesterday that in all caps said I’M PROUD OF YOU. The fuck? What is this gay shit.

Look I don’t currently have a position in GME, but it clearly looks like the game has changed. I think you all are collectively right that had the fuckery not happened last Thursday the squeeze to $500+ was on. But guess what, the rules of the game changed that fucking day and you all sat there in a prayer circle holding each other’s dicks telling each other to hold. You really thought these hedge funds weren’t going to figure out how to fuck you and your 4 shares of GME in your robinhood account were going to “break the system.”

Some of you were sitting on life changing money. I just sorted by new and some dumbfuck is down 2 million dollars today alone and has banked zero profit on GME. Like what the fuck. We are here to make money. End of story bar none. Fuck your feelings. Fuck your friends. Fuck the dude in the daily telling you to hold and diamond hands. There’s nothing noble about holding this to zero. Take your money and get the fuck out and buy a house for your mom. I can’t believe I have to type this shit out."

That being said, perhaps there is a reason that most threads are GME related? This may be because of the subreddit drama, as stated. 

All that said, as someone who has been a part of WSB for the better part of a decade, this is quite literally the subreddit at its absolute finest. Which is another reason why people complaining about all the GME threads is way more annoying than just allowing it to happen."

From there drilled down to try to understand the field and the players. Ark Invest helped a lot with that, would recommend them highly, they're used a lot as a starting point for people here I think. Then just looked at the fundamentals of the top players including PACB, saw strong technicals and momentum, growth prospects etc decided to jump in.

I'm still learning also so I'm sorry if that's not a super sophisticated answer but I just wanted to get across that I started at 30,000 feet, with a really birds-eye look at the world in general and then slowly drilling down step by step to one specific stock."

lurkwhenbored,1612967784.0,"# Market arbitrage play with APHA and TLRY

##TLRY go up because weed deal in UK and other news
##TLRY do reverse merger with APHA

“Under terms of the merger deal, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share they own, while Tilray shareholders will see no adjustment to their holdings.”

##APHA should be worth 83% of TLRY instead of being valued at about 46% of TLRY 

APHA = 30 CAD = 23 USD
(23 / 50) = 0.46

So the difference between the two is the profit made (50 - 23 = 27) multiplied by the share given (0.83) (27 * 0.83 = 22.41)

# Guaranteed $22.41 USD per share of APHA at current prices"

moazzam0,1612968862.0,"GME Valuation

Cohen [sold](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chewy_(company)) chewy for $3.3 billion, when it had $2 billion revenue. This was before infinite money brrr valuations, in 2017.

GME has an EV of about $4.4 billion (not counting receivables, inventory, and factoring debt) with pre-COVID revenue of $8 billion. This is before they became a worldwide symbol of sticking it to the man.

Assuming Cohen can only accomplish at GME what he accomplished at chewy and has no new tricks, he can easily get us to a $14-20 billion market cap with $8-10 billion in future revenue. That yeilds a post-turnaround share price of at least $200.

If we go further than this and assume Cohen can permanently increase GME's gross margins (digital sales of exclusive games), the sky is the limit. GME [already sells](https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-exclusive-gamestop-value-worth/) exclusive games, so this is not a huge stretch.

For those saying the console makers and game studios don't want GameStop to thrive: Amazon can simply add games to prime and become a real pain in the ass to all those console makers and game studios. They need GameStop more than you think."

lurkwhenbored,1612968990.0,"# Market arbitrage play with APHA and TLRY

##TLRY go up because weed deal in UK and other news
##TLRY do reverse merger with APHA

“Under terms of the merger deal, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share they own, while Tilray shareholders will see no adjustment to their holdings.”

##APHA should be worth 83% of TLRY instead of being valued at about 46% of TLRY 

APHA = 30 CAD = 23 USD
(23 / 50) = 0.46

So the difference between the two is the profit made (50 - 23 = 27) multiplied by the share given (0.83) (27 * 0.83 = 22.41)

# Guaranteed $22.41 USD per share of APHA at current prices

## Disclaimer: APHA has a market arbitrage opportunity, but remember it relies on TLRY maintaining it's current high value. If you don't think it will, you should sell APHA rather than wait for the merger."

HandsySpaniard,1612969061.0," 

* TLRY and APHA are merging.
* 1 Share of TLRY is bouncing around 60/share at the moment.
* 1 Share of APHA is about 28/share

When the merger completes the publicly announced ratio of the new company to the old is that current Tilray stockholders will retain exactly one share, while due to market cap+outstanding shares at the time of the merger, APHA shareholders will retain .83 shares per current share of APHA.

So, if current prices hold there is a HUGE gap here that must close. Either TLRY must come down, or APHA must rise. Based on current value of TLRY, APHA shares have an expected value of 49.8

Based on the current value of APHA, TLRY shares have an expected value of 33.5ish

OR, if for some reason the gap stays as large as it is, APHA shareholders will realize a 78% gain at the moment of the merger.

Positions:

APHA 35c Feb 12

effinwookie,1612969142.0,"DD: Been looking at the Apple/Kia in depth and honestly it’s kind of a strange situation.

-Apple didn’t seem to want a partner more a parts maker ala Foxconn to build not develop their car. Apple has always been shown to be very controlling of their product to a fault and toss aside vendors they use at the drop of the hat. 

-Hyundai/Kia at the highest level seemed to disagree with the move in general, the rumors that they would boot it down to Kia to handle now make sense. Apple would realistically bring little value to the company as a whole when Hyundai has invested billions in their own tech.

-Leaks were a way to walk away from the table and possibly a negotiating tool. Lots of articles quote the statement “negotiations paused”. We could very well see them come back to the table for a better deal. Even if not I believe Hyundai would walk away in a better position.

-No major manufacturer would want to take this project on if they are already developing their own self driving or EV platforms. They would also risk borking their own brand if they do take the deal. The rumors about other brands like Nissan seem far fetched at this point seeing Nissan is struggling to build and sell their own cars.

-We could very well see Apple outright buy an EV startup in the near future. Likely bets? Lucid and Canoo are two that come mind, I don’t see them attach themselves to Nio or any foreign brand. Canoo being the one they have shown interest in as recently as last year but Lucid being a more luxury brand that might mesh better with Apples identity.

All around it’s very a very bullish situation, you have multiple points of entry at this time. EV is poised to break out in the next year or so, you will do well to attach yourself to some EV companies this early. I still feel we will get some confirmation as the situation unfolds in the next coming months."

With a market order, it fills at whatever price someone is willing to fill it for; this is almost always above market price like in your case."

Abs0lut_Unit,1612969722.0,"I'm actually long on it, they destroyed their recent earnings report and have a decent div yield. Fundamentally strong company.

However, a lot of people seem to think that it's being shorted into the ground right now, which might be why you'll see the name pop up around here. It does have a small public float and the daily price movement is kinda sus. Others might say that it's a mortgage company and as such kinda boring, but if you look into it, it has fintech elements which show promise.

If you're considering it, I'd say go with shares. If it is being short attacked you're better insulated against that with shares, and ideally the stock gets included in the Russell 2k and bought up by dividend investors/institutions."

Let’s say you have 10k & You find a quality stonk you like. Would you buy long term ATM calls? For 9-12 months out. Or just buy the stock outright and hold for 9-12 months. Which would net you a higher return assuming the stock goes up 30%."

stanky_puss,1612969917.0,"That’s odd it placed so late. I’ve not got any experience with etrade so I don’t really know of what would cause that. As for the margin question you asked the other guy. Typically a broker will charge interest on the margin as long as you have enough assets to cover the margin. At any point, if they feel you are at risk of defaulting on your margin, they can do a margin call. This allows them to liquidate your assets and use the money to cover the margin. But again, I’m not familiar with etrade so it would be best to call them."

zoopboop-111,1612970064.0,"Check delta. It tells you how much the option moves when the underlying moves $1. So since you’re paying less that the full amount of shares for the right to control those shares, you should have a greater percentage profit at most strikes. But a lot if things determine premium and you could get crushed on IV. For what you’re trying to do (leverage with a call option because you’re bullish on the stock) it would be wise to get a delta close to 1 and that means you go deep ITM. Then you have less theta to worry about. Your option might be half the price of buying the shares outright but it will go up in conjunction with the stock and thus doubling your return (or loss). LEAPS in this fashion are generally deep ITM for this leveraged return but if you can’t afford that, then closer to ATM is just a bit higher risk with IV priced into the premiums. Hope that makes sense!"

I think TLRY will come down eventually, but that it’s new lower price will still be in the arbitrage area for APHA.

So if you’re worried about getting caught bag holding TLRY but are fomoing, go with APHA"

hawaiianpunchout,1612970164.0,"Aphria and Tilray will finalize their merger in either April or May, turning all aphria shares into Tilray shares at an exchange rate of .8381. So basically if you hold APHA, you’ll end up with TLRY anyway. But depending on where the stock price is at that exchange might change and you could make a lot on the swap. For example 100 shares of APHA at $28 ($2800) would become 84 shares of TLRY at $58 ($4872) so you instantly make money even if TLRY stock doesn’t go up after the merger, which it will. Good luck."

mscarce,1612970242.0,"weed stonks are long plays. Especially with APHA and TLRY. They are merging by the end of the 2nd quarter, so at the latest June. And any APHA stock holders will gain 83% of the  stock price of TLRY. If TLRY stays this far ahead, you will be gained 10+ bucks per share for APHA for free.

Once the US makes weed legal, it's going to be dirt cheap to produce like any other agriculture commodity 

Canadian weed companies that focus only on growing aren't going to see the huge impact the were expecting not to mention their will be tons of US competition. HEXOs is focusing on making weed drinks and already has a subsidiary set up with coors  that will be cranking out CBD drinks soon. Really what they are doing is getting ready for legalization, they are getting the infrastructure in place so that they can make a quick switch over to THC.

Weed products are going to be the money maker, not weed itself"

zoopboop-111,1612970689.0,Shares don’t expire. That’s a huge risk removed. I think LEAPS are often bought as far out as possible. So with Apple you can probably go to 2023 even ... September is more of a gamble. Still a good leverage if you’re confident. But deep ITM and as far out as possible will be the lowest risk while achieving roughly 2x leverage

If you're in it for the long run this doesn't apply to you. For those of you short term be careful.

For the past week BB had done great being detached from gme and climbing a good amount but for the past 2 days it has trended gme for no reason.

I personally decided to close any short term calls as I don't have any confidence on the stock while it's attached to gme. 

My believe is if gme tanks horribly it Will bring down bb with it. It was good holding with all of you.

This is a personal opinion, not investment advice."

RAGE_CAKES,1612971181.0,"I've posted this multiple times before, it's nice that weed industry is getting its comeuppance, but federal legalization really is a nothing burger long term. It will ultimately be up to states to follow through with whether or not they want to follow through with legalization. What will sustain the industry long term is states' choice to legalize (yes, just cause the fed oks it doesnt mean mean a state has to follow through) as it will be up to states to regulate their own trade. This will be something interesting to watch.

In regards to states, also keep in mind that once a state legalizes, it does not mean the industry instantly starts turning a profit. Take a look at NJ, the vote to pass legalization happened back in Nov iirc. They still haven't successfully passed any bills on regulation of the industry. There will be alot state political dickering if/when a state legalizes.

In short, legalization is alot more complicated process then I think people are aware of. There will be shake ups and new IPOs if/when this occurs. 

Imo I believe the smart play is GRWG, which has true sustained growth. It has clapped 12 earning's cheeks in a row.  GRWG doesnt sell weed but the equipment to grow it and is aggressive in opening up brick and mortar shops in states that do legalize. This is all hype right now but i think itll die down when this initial frenzy dies down (and it will, dont kid yourself, it's the nature of the market). GRWG will remain and grow steadily while these stocks will flair and die down. I prefer steady bets to hype and memes"

Hey everyone. This is by no means a meme stock.  
I was watching this stock closely from the fall of 2020 when they were around .40 cents and have been on a consistent grow. My average is 1.30 and I currently hold about 4000 shares, if I had the ability atm I would be buying more and plan to in the near future.

This pharmceutical research company is the VERY FIRST company ever licensed by Health Canada to PRODUCE, Sell, import and export Psilocybin, Psilocin, DMT, Mescaline and MDMA. They are the FIRST company licensed by health canada to trade on the stock exchange in this sector. Currently they have a monopoly on the emerging market in Canada and are also partnered with MAPS (the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Sciences) and work closely with John Hopkins University.

Earlier this year Health Canada have added Psilocybin and MDMA to the special access program which means that people with depression, smoking cessation   and a multitude of other alements may be referred to the special access program for these pharmaceuticals which are soon to be licensed and regulated accordingly.

Thanks for MAPS in the US, the FDA has designated MDMA assisted therapy for PTSD a breakthrough Therapy with UNPRECEDENTED results.

The same has been said about psilocybin.  
MAPS is also working now with Numinus to bring pass MDMA assisted psychotherapy in Canada aswell.

Something very special about this company (other than its the first of its kind) is that they are not making psilocybin or Psilocin synthetically (for a research company or pharmaceutical company to purchase a gram of synthetic psilocybin extract is around $10 000 per gram. NUMINUS WELLNESS is making their psilocybin naturally and extracting from actual mushrooms giving patients the choice to experience the natural medication in a natural way. Since they also have the license to sell their psilocybin to other agencies, this will drastically reduce the cost and make Numinus one of the PRIME suppliers for psilocybin to a host of different pharmaceutical companies and research agencies.

They are a new IPO that just came on the market less than a year ago. Back in May 2020 during some of the worst times of covid. They still emerged strong and have increased over 451% in the past 6 months. This will continue to grow, with names like Dennis Mckenna on the board of advisors its hard to see this company fail.  
If you go back to old episodes on Joe Rogan with Rick Doblin (the creator of MAPS) and Dennis Mckenna, you will discover how much of a life long passion this is for these people. They are not in this to make money but change the world and the way we view medications.  
There is alot of good information in those episodes of where they see their futures going and this was years before the company was created.

Recently Numinus has completed their first successful grow and extraction of psilocybin and also recently aquired MindSpace Wellness. A ketamine assisted psychotherapy company located in Montreal with a few active clinics.

Not only is this a reaearch company that has the licensing to produce and sell these pharmaceuticals but they also have the licensing and the rights for ANY NEW IP (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) that arises from their reaearch. They are in the works of creating a new pharmaceutical to release onto the market and own the rights to produce it for certain alements.

Currently Numinus has just released new Warrents to incentivize investors. Using warrents for a new emerging company is always a good idea rather than options since they can make the money directly from the warrents to themselves and use the money to further grow their company.

I suggest people take a strong look at their values as a company, their investor portfolio and a Google search on their new news they have released.

Here are some interesting links

[http://canadianwarrants.com/values/current.htm#axzz6m5A0YbgD](http://canadianwarrants.com/values/current.htm#axzz6m5A0YbgD)

If you scroll down you will find Numinus Wellness, ordered alphabetically.

[Https://ceo.ca/numi](https://ceo.ca/numi)

Their recent SEDAR filings also demonstrate them to be in a large cash position at this moment and earnings have increased dramatically.

They also do not rely on funding to support their research. They currently own and operate a Cannabis Company that not only grows flower for sale but does full scale extraction and testing for cannabis.  
This is how they primarily fund their research.

This is a company on the forefront of New medicine and is currently doing trails in Vancouver and University of Toronto.

ITS WORTH CHECKING OUT WHILE ITS STILL CHEAP.

I really like this stock.

PHK_JaySteel,1612972934.0,Just got in at -10%
Aldonall12,1612972934.0,"IV crush is usually around earnings. Essentially, an option's value comes from a few places. First, intrinsic value. That's how much the option itself is worth if you were to exercise and sell. If you have $65 calls and the stock is $70, you have $5 Intrinsic Value. Then you have Extrinsic Value, which is a function of both time and volatility. Basically, how much the stock is predicted to move by \* how long it has to move. Theta is how much time value you lose per day, and it generally ramps up the closer you get to the expiration. IV tends to rise around things like earnings or pumps, and falls afterwards. So even though a stock may rise after earnings (increasing intrinsic value), the volatility (IV) may fall so much that the total value of the option goes down.

TL;DR: A stock that is $65 but might go to $80 after earnings could be worth more than a stock that's $70 after earnings and won't be moving."

goodcleancannabis,1612973042.0," NUMINUS WELLNESS (LKYSF - USD / NUMI.V CAD)

Hey everyone. This is by no means a meme stock.  
I was watching this stock closely from the fall of 2020 when they were around .40 cents and have been on a consistent grow. My average is 1.30 and I currently hold about 4000 shares, if I had the ability atm I would be buying more and plan to in the near future.

This pharmceutical research company is the VERY FIRST company ever licensed by Health Canada to PRODUCE, Sell, import and export Psilocybin, Psilocin, DMT, Mescaline and MDMA. They are the FIRST company licensed by health canada to trade on the stock exchange in this sector. Currently they have a monopoly on the emerging market in Canada and are also partnered with MAPS (the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Sciences) and work closely with John Hopkins University.

Earlier this year Health Canada have added Psilocybin and MDMA to the special access program which means that people with depression, smoking cessation   and a multitude of other alements may be referred to the special access program for these pharmaceuticals which are soon to be licensed and regulated accordingly.

Thanks for MAPS in the US, the FDA has designated MDMA assisted therapy for PTSD a breakthrough Therapy with UNPRECEDENTED results.

The same has been said about psilocybin.  
MAPS is also working now with Numinus to bring pass MDMA assisted psychotherapy in Canada aswell.

Something very special about this company (other than its the first of its kind) is that they are not making psilocybin or Psilocin synthetically (for a research company or pharmaceutical company to purchase a gram of synthetic psilocybin extract is around $10 000 per gram. NUMINUS WELLNESS is making their psilocybin naturally and extracting from actual mushrooms giving patients the choice to experience the natural medication in a natural way. Since they also have the license to sell their psilocybin to other agencies, this will drastically reduce the cost and make Numinus one of the PRIME suppliers for psilocybin to a host of different pharmaceutical companies and research agencies.

They are a new IPO that just came on the market less than a year ago. Back in May 2020 during some of the worst times of covid. They still emerged strong and have increased over 451% in the past 6 months. This will continue to grow, with names like Dennis Mckenna on the board of advisors its hard to see this company fail.  
If you go back to old episodes on Joe Rogan with Rick Doblin (the creator of MAPS) and Dennis Mckenna, you will discover how much of a life long passion this is for these people. They are not in this to make money but change the world and the way we view medications.  
There is alot of good information in those episodes of where they see their futures going and this was years before the company was created.

Recently Numinus has completed their first successful grow and extraction of psilocybin and also recently aquired MindSpace Wellness. A ketamine assisted psychotherapy company located in Montreal with a few active clinics.

Not only is this a reaearch company that has the licensing to produce and sell these pharmaceuticals but they also have the licensing and the rights for ANY NEW IP (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) that arises from their reaearch. They are in the works of creating a new pharmaceutical to release onto the market and own the rights to produce it for certain alements.

Currently Numinus has just released new Warrents to incentivize investors. Using warrents for a new emerging company is always a good idea rather than options since they can make the money directly from the warrents to themselves and use the money to further grow their company.

I suggest people take a strong look at their values as a company, their investor portfolio and a Google search on their new news they have released.

Here are some interesting links

[http://canadianwarrants.com/values/current.htm#axzz6m5A0YbgD](http://canadianwarrants.com/values/current.htm#axzz6m5A0YbgD)

If you scroll down you will find Numinus Wellness, ordered alphabetically.

[Https://ceo.ca/numi](https://ceo.ca/numi)

Their recent SEDAR filings also demonstrate them to be in a large cash position at this moment and earnings have increased dramatically.

They also do not rely on funding to support their research. They currently own and operate a Cannabis Company that not only grows flower for sale but does full scale extraction and testing for cannabis.  
This is how they primarily fund their research.

This is a company on the forefront of New medicine and is currently doing trails in Vancouver and University of Toronto.

ITS WORTH CHECKING OUT WHILE ITS STILL CHEAP.

I really like this stock.

And yes, you're right. Longer expiry calls are less likely to get IV crushed in the short term, as you've got multiple high-impact events that can happen between purchase and expiry (multiple earnings calls, macro market changes, etc).

Another approach is to sell BEFORE earnings if the stock has run up at all (or IV has crept up), to avoid the IV drop afterwards."

It gets shorted and the price goes down. That’s what shorted stocks tend to do. That’s what happens normally. Short squeezes backfiring on shorts are an extreme rarity. 

The only one trying to have it both ways is you - you’re correlated a heavily shorted stock with a certain short squeeze. Of course, if I asked you why you didn’t sell during the squeeze on 1/27 you’ll say that the squeeze hasn’t happened yet, right?

So which is it? Is the squeeze on the cusp of happening again despite declines in shorting, which makes no sense?

Also... the data is from after the stock peaked. Easily verifiable. Hey look, guess why it was on a massive slide down since then!"

Unhealing,1612973656.0,"makes sense if you're not already in it. APHA and TLRY especially look like they could get a correction in the short-term. I opened positions weeks ago (mostly in CGC anyway tbh), so I don't think this should impact me. Long-term I still think the fundamentals are there for the well-performing weed companies, though. people treating them like they're a ""meme stock"" just because they got popular last night annoys me. They've been making bank YTD.

but I get it. if you're not in it early it can become risky with the added volatility of wsb."

The thing is most people simply don’t do it or think they trade differently when there’s actual money. If you can stand it, try it. Most people here likely just threw some money into a trading account and started small though. 

Example: you can paper trade TSLA calls and puts all you want but if you were to throw, say, $5k in an account (which might be much more than you intend to start off with), you still likely wouldn’t be able to afford a single TSLA contract so your IRL moves would be different"

I'd love to hear why?  ABNB went public 60 days ago, DASH 13 mos ago, BMBL tomorrow, UBER 2yrs ago.   So I can't be ""5 years late"".  

I'm up 43% on ABNB, +52% Lyft, +56% Uber, I'm out on EXPE right now.  It's a good price when we get out of COVID, but stupid high given current revenue.  I missed DASH (or did I?) ...but I am saving my cash for BMBL to diversify.  

Uber and Lyft haven't even turned the corner yet.  One of the two will be $1,000+ stocks when they start printing the money."

O_Sinnerman,1612974061.0,"Yes. A lot of people on here are hoping to get rich overnight. 

Especially with what happened a couple weeks ago. A lot of them are looking for that next stock that jumps 1000+% overnight. So they're throwing money at companies on a whim, and panicking when it goes down a little. 

Just stay calm, pay attention to the trends, and buy more when it dips. Every stock dips a little bit. But if you hold/add, and don't panick (as long as it's a good stock), you'll be fine.

A lot of people in here came too late to the game for gme and amc, and lost a lot of money in the process. So they're looking to recoup their losses overnight."

Which means smart money is on APHA. If merge fails the TLRY will drop hard."

teamdiabetes11,1612974345.0,"Check out the PLTR chart.  Technically, it looks very good.  Especially if you believe in the company and management.  It’s a 17 year old company and is still working on real repeatable revenue that they can grow.  For now, the stock is still looked at as a, “Prove it,” because it has not made tons of money yet.  I think it will.  That coupled with the PLTR chart makes me very comfortable adding to my position once this shakeout ends.  

The fact that it doesn’t hop around 30-50% every day actually makes it a better investment imho.  I prefer boomer stock behavior, not the volatility we’ve seen.  Not financial advice, but I think being down on PLTR is a poor decision in my personal opinion."

That being said, Paramount Plus will have over 30,000 episodes from ViacomCBS channels like BET, Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, etc. No joke, they want to be HBOMAX and they’re setting themselves up for it."

Celtic_Legend,1612974388.0,"Because no1 here owns stocks. Half of us own contracts that exp on friday, then 49% of us own contracts that exp next week. So a dip on wednesday fucks us because a dip of 5% can wipe our value of more than 50%. So we cant sell and then we bleed dry till friday. If i buy a contract thats 10% otm. The stock has to rise 10% by friday. Well now it has to rise 10% plus another 5.2% if it drops 5% today. Meaning im going to lose everything invested. But if it rises 10% on wednesday/thursday i could make 100% my investment instead of 10%

Also when the whole market is red, we cant buy the dip. Selling a -5% stock to buy another -5% stock isnt that great of a return"

&#x200B;

  
I was watching this stock closely from the fall of 2020 when they were around .40 cents and have been on a consistent grow. My average is 1.30 and I currently hold about 4000 shares, if I had the ability atm I would be buying more and plan to in the near future.

This pharmceutical research company is the VERY FIRST company ever licensed by Health Canada to PRODUCE, Sell, import and export Psilocybin, Psilocin, DMT, Mescaline and MDMA. They are the FIRST company licensed by health canada to trade on the stock exchange in this sector. Currently they have a monopoly on the emerging market in Canada and are also partnered with MAPS (the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Sciences) and work closely with John Hopkins University.

Earlier this year Health Canada have added Psilocybin and MDMA to the special access program which means that people with depression, smoking cessation   and a multitude of other alements may be referred to the special access program for these pharmaceuticals which are soon to be licensed and regulated accordingly.

Thanks for MAPS in the US, the FDA has designated MDMA assisted therapy for PTSD a breakthrough Therapy with UNPRECEDENTED results.

The same has been said about psilocybin.  
MAPS is also working now with Numinus to bring pass MDMA assisted psychotherapy in Canada aswell.

Something very special about this company (other than its the first of its kind) is that they are not making psilocybin or Psilocin synthetically (for a research company or pharmaceutical company to purchase a gram of synthetic psilocybin extract is around $10 000 per gram. NUMINUS WELLNESS is making their psilocybin naturally and extracting from actual mushrooms giving patients the choice to experience the natural medication in a natural way. Since they also have the license to sell their psilocybin to other agencies, this will drastically reduce the cost and make Numinus one of the PRIME suppliers for psilocybin to a host of different pharmaceutical companies and research agencies.

They are a new IPO that just came on the market less than a year ago. Back in May 2020 during some of the worst times of covid. They still emerged strong and have increased over 451% in the past 6 months. This will continue to grow, with names like Dennis Mckenna on the board of advisors its hard to see this company fail.  
If you go back to old episodes on Joe Rogan with Rick Doblin (the creator of MAPS) and Dennis Mckenna, you will discover how much of a life long passion this is for these people. They are not in this to make money but change the world and the way we view medications.  
There is alot of good information in those episodes of where they see their futures going and this was years before the company was created.

Recently Numinus has completed their first successful grow and extraction of psilocybin and also recently aquired MindSpace Wellness. A ketamine assisted psychotherapy company located in Montreal with a few active clinics.

Not only is this a reaearch company that has the licensing to produce and sell these pharmaceuticals but they also have the licensing and the rights for ANY NEW IP (INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) that arises from their reaearch. They are in the works of creating a new pharmaceutical to release onto the market and own the rights to produce it for certain alements.

Currently Numinus has just released new Warrents to incentivize investors. Using warrents for a new emerging company is always a good idea rather than options since they can make the money directly from the warrents to themselves and use the money to further grow their company.

I suggest people take a strong look at their values as a company, their investor portfolio and a Google search on their new news they have released.

Here are some interesting links

[http://canadianwarrants.com/values/current.htm#axzz6m5A0YbgD](http://canadianwarrants.com/values/current.htm#axzz6m5A0YbgD)

If you scroll down you will find Numinus Wellness, ordered alphabetically.

[Https://ceo.ca/numi](https://ceo.ca/numi)

Their recent SEDAR filings also demonstrate them to be in a large cash position at this moment and earnings have increased dramatically.

They also do not rely on funding to support their research. They currently own and operate a Cannabis Company that not only grows flower for sale but does full scale extraction and testing for cannabis.  
This is how they primarily fund their research.

This is a company on the forefront of New medicine and is currently doing trails in Vancouver and University of Toronto.

ITS WORTH CHECKING OUT WHILE ITS STILL CHEAP.

I really like this stock.

The thing is, people keep thinking AMC is still on the brink of bankruptcy. They aren't. They have raised over a billion in financing, 400M from private investors, and 600M from additional stock sales, plus they unloaded 600M in debt for a stock exchange, and may work  out a another deal with one of their largest creditors to do the same. The only issue AMC has right now is pandemic related, and studios holding back releases. Once that isn't a problem anymore (summer hopefully) then AMC is in a better position than they have been in a long time."

This graph and that website should jump start your due diligence.

Switch to fidelity or Schwab. Buy OTC US MSO. Wait for safe banking. Wait for nasdaq uplist. Wait for state level legalization news. Wait for federal legalization news. Profit at every catalyst along the way. 

Check us MSO merger status. Arbitrage into upper tier companies by buying their acquisitions stock on dips.

RedditIsDrunkAccount,1612975122.0,"Ed Zachary. Tumultuous election where a significant portion of voters went Republican, mid terms in two years. Pot is the biggest stick that they can swing, moderate democrats are more likely to be on board than moderate republicans are likely to *not* be.

15 states are legal, 12 are ""medical and decriminalized"" - and 6 of those
(AZ, CT, NM, NY, RI, VA) are likely to flip fully this year which gives you 21 and 6 - which is a majority of the united states. 13 are decriminalized and only 6 are full negatives. 


[18 months ago](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/11/14/americans-support-marijuana-legalization/) Pew research said 66% of americans support legalization, you think it's gotten worse over the pandemic? The democrats win more republican votes on legalization then they lose on it for certain. Add in stimulus payments and Biden overcoming the pandemic (regardless of ground laid before he's going to benefit from it) and you should see a good showing for dems at mid terms"

Named under tlry, as in the deal. After the merger, the deal is under tlry. Why pay for $3 milk when you can basically get “both” for the “price” of 1

They're not a mobile phone company anymore, my friend worked in zoning for them to rent out space to put up 5g towers literally everywhere, big towers, and they even are putting up these small 5g devices on telephone polls and light post literally everywhere.
They're doing this and then leasing out to Tmobile, Sprint, AT&T... In the near future, Nokia will have 5g all over the world, and your favorite mobile providers will be paying top dollar to lease this from them."

ManfromMich,1612976448.0,(Poking CRSR with a stick) do something....
coffetech,1612976449.0,"Nice, I got limited money so I can't do much :/.

&#x200B;

So the volume is actually pretty fucking crazy. Around 1.4 billion shares in total and the daily value is at 1.1 billion. Unless I'm reading it wrong.  I know some of those shares are probably the same being traded but it's still insane.

&#x200B;

YTD is already at 300% how long do you think the hype can last? If most stock holders are newer people and not old, their share price should be closer to market price and if a tank happens I could see everyone dumping pretty quickly.

&#x200B;

But if weed legalization somehow became a big topic in the next week/s it could back fire easily. Personally I feel the hype could only last 1 or 2 weeks.

&#x200B;

Looking at the price history the stock has had similar100% increase with a 40-100% dump in the following days, but that was pre wsb, if quite a bit of paperhands bought the stock then this shit could tank a lot more than its history.

Weed there is a lot of pumping going on and people trying to get in on mergers. There will be a big dump on weed stonks after this plays out. Will get in on it later this year. ICLN did go up a lot early Jan but has been flat since. Think investors are waiting to see how new Congress and administration handles the stimulus package before they dump into clean energy.

Interesting comment from Googlestoleourpatent on yahoo finance board

""David and Goliath story. Netlist (NLST) patent was stolen 12 years ago by Google after they signed an NDA to look at Netlists memory patent. Then Google promptly bootlegged it through a Chinese manufacturer screwing Netlist a California company. Google thought they could bankrupt Netlist but CEO fought back for 12 years and won a final victory against Google June 15 2020 when the federal appeals court upheld the lower courts decision against google in 78 claims with a rule 36 decision. Google exhausted all appeals and soon the USPTO will issue the new patent recertification upholding all 78 claims. Stay against Google will be lifted. Do your DD and understand this is a seminal patent that propelled Google to the forefront of searches with stolen Tech. Its time for Google to pay. Many of us believe that Google has paid manipulators to artificially deflate this stocks price. Check out their patent and see if you agree. Damage award should be in the Billions."""

World continues to move forward with cannabis legalization and $APHA is arguably in the best position. Valuations seem a bit high for the Canadian market, but the USA market is 10x which means they're still undervalued. Then factor in $TLRY making moves in Europe for medical, and merging with $APHA.

I'll add countries, etc. need money and solutions to the deficits COVID-19 has created. Cannabis legalization helps with this and is the biggest job creator. It's also nonpartisan, in that all political sides want it.

Long story short, but do your research, cannabis is not a fad and is a long term play. The world is slowly ending prohibition. Alcohol wasn't a fad, and cannabis can do so much more than alcohol."

With infastructure set up in america and germany already they are ready to launch the weed side of their business into those large markets the day they become legal. The senate democrats have also said they plan on legalizing weed by EOY. Not to mention the 1:0.83 ratio of share transfer and apha trading at roughly half instead of 0.83. You're looking at a 33% gain right there (at current prices). Assuming tilray or apha don't gap up/down. So. It's a play for a couple months from now."

They are still proving that they can grow repeatable revenue and have been moving in that direction.  But for now, it will continue to move in a tighter range and actually trade more on fundamentals than your normal WSB’s hype play.  I trust it and like the company and am waiting for this shakeout to end, then I’ll likely add to my position.  I’m expecting a pretty big increase throughout the year if management can keep the momentum shown in 3Q reporting going.  But I’d be lying if I wasn’t nervous at the rate of positive news headlines ahead of earnings.  Does feel like they may miss expectations.  I’m not a financial advisor though so maybe I’m just dumb."

APHA will take over as their CEO is taking the CEO position post merger and TLRY's current CEO will step down.

2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 20-25% at present

signsandwonders,1612980145.0,"Alright I'm fucking obsessed with capitalizing off the growth of Clubhouse (social app) right now. It's not publicly traded but services they use are ones to watch.

Full disclosure I'm a software engineer with some basic infosec experience and I'm ""reverse engineering"" their API by watching my phone traffic and seeing some non-public statistics.

A safe projection for minimum user numbers by March 1 is 22 million. That's up 10x from last month, and that isn't taking the acceleration into account so it'll likely be significantly higher. 

Anyone with a tech/data background want to discuss this? Thinking about making a post either here or a smaller sub."

If it cant it may get smacked into the high 50s again before making another move... If this helps you make a decision at all. Ive been holding march calls since it was at 35 in october so I've been watching it like a hawk, deciding to take profit if it gets rejected or let it ride if it breaks out."

TitoSantos,1612980412.0,"Take a look at shares available to borrow for TLRY according to iborrowdesk. Only 300 available at a 27% borrow fee. Just two days ago on 2/8 there were 1,500,000 shares available at 7.7%. 

What this means for the smooth brains - a good amount of shorts covered on 2/8 when the price was between $26-29, however roughly 1,499,700 new shorts have stepped in since then at a price of $35-50 paying between 7 - 27% borrow fee. The first wave of the squeeze has taken place boosting stock from $19 to 30  (+57%) but a second wave of short speculators has stepped in at around $50 which will fold and cover shorts causing another bounce if it does not fall below $50. 


TLDR: a large amount of shorts have stepped in yesterday at around $50 with 27% borrow fee.

optionsCone,1612981026.0,"A TLRY scenario:

Power hour (last hour in session) is when hedge funds/shorts close their short positions in TLRY. They can't afford to have TLRY run-up after hours, esp since volume is drastically lower with increasing buy orders. This naturally pushes the stock higher. Great for Bulls. Horrible for shorts 

Also Shorts can't afford to take on increased risk esp with substantive news and real deals Tilray managed to accomplish recently. Shorts are scrambling. I think 300 is realistic 

Not financial advice.

If it stays below 30 dollars, the option is OTM (Out of The Money) and expires worthless on 2/19. The strike price is essentially how high up you expect the stock to go (The higher above your strike the more money your option is worth)"

ignig,1612981547.0,"True story, I was at a party with Tim Cook once, call it a **Ice Cream Social.** I noticed someone brought Tim Cook a bowl of ice cream, of which only had a single scoop of ice cream. As the party went on, I noticed Tim Cook would fiddle with his spoon, move the delicious cream around the bowl and sometimes even put the spoon up to his mouth, but the fuckin weirdo never put the spoon in his mouth. 

This charade went on for no less than 40 minutes; an endless loop of Tim sirring a bowl of half melted handmade goop, placing the spoon to his lips and returning the spoon to the bowl with the entire contents of the spoon still visible. Long story short, the dude is an asshole and fuck Tim Cook."

I assume this will get ignored, but what the hell. I love WSB, but it can be hard to sift through the threads to find good information on stocks. If anything, I spend a lot of time on here because some of the members are friggin' hilarious and I really enjoy some of the funny comments. 

Since I don't have a lot of Karma, any new threads I post will likely get ignored, so I would love for a highly-awarded WSB member to post something like the following: 

""List your top 3 stocks that you think are a good investment and why""

""Rules: only post 3 stocks (with an actual explanation of why), no excessive emojis, exclamation points and keep the witty banter to a minimum.""

That's it. Just 3 stocks with explanations (choose only your top 3), no emojis, no jokes about your wife's boyfriend, etc. Just an old-fashioned boring thread that lays out what people are thinking as best bets for making some bank. This is not to take away any attention from GME or AMC or whatever else. (I have 8 GME and 52 AMC that I am holding and will not be selling, so I am still in it to win it)

Anyway, I am not new to Reddit, but fairly new at being *active* on Reddit, so maybe this is a retarded post and will be ignored. I just think that it would be nice to see what other members are buying.

speaking of members, my penis is 14-inches long

Its_the_dankness,1612982982.0,"✊ fist on chest, no fear. Nio and RXT are perma wsb-meme stocks, good hold depending on your basis. Thanks man, this last week has been transformative for my holdings. Weed is singlehandedly bringing me back towards positive all-time. 

As for FDs, I should go back and look at my all time transactions, sort out for anything a week and under expiry and see what my W/L is. Numberwise i imagine more losses than wins, but it would be interesting to see the actual value of the plays overall. Weighed down a lot by some really shitty plays I made during the March crash / April recovery"

Jumblyfun,1612983964.0,"I'm curious if it might be coming back down to earth due to retail sentiment? Buying might have cooled off. Personally in my own bullshit mind I'm very suspicious of the thing that shall not be named play and instantly makes me want to get some puts for tesla when more money clears. I feel like ""that"" exists to pump and dump idiot libertarians. I wouldn't ever want to use a naughty word for any real life commodity other than cash because it's so volatile. Remember when that dude bought a domino's pizza for like 2k ""ctsnbn"" in 2010? Shits like an 80 million dollar pizza by today's standards. Dude probably roped himself a few years ago thinking about it. Why would I spend said stuff on a car that depreciates crazy fast when that has the chance to double the next year. It's almost like they are trying to use the ""ctsnbn"" to increase cash reserves which is pretty risky for a huge corp. Seems weird to me and the news out of China about tesla might spell problems down the road as well

bicameral_mind,1612984105.0,"Essentially, yes.

Wash sale rules apply if you lost money on investments overall for the year, and want to claim that up-to $3,000 deduction.  Then you'll have to dig into the details on those 30 day wash trades to see what your 'actual' loss was which is a PITA.  Capital loss is a deduction, not a credit.

But it cuts both ways.  If you're profitable at year end wash sale will lower your taxable income on those gains.  Instead of claiming the capital loss, you get to say my actual cost basis is X, not Y, and X is greater than Y - thus your income for tax purposes is lower.  If you think reentering a position within 30 days of closing another stands to be a winner, then you should go for it.

It's just annoying come tax time to do the calculations, that's the only real downside."

thegininyou,1612985000.0,"Not that I'm an expert on it but some things I've learned from experience. 

Calls = I think itll go up

I'm going to stick with these.  
There's also Puts = I think it'll go down
(If you already know this I'm sorry just wanted to start with basics)

1. Do longer dated call options for stocks you believe in.  Look into LEAPs or at the very least, a few months out. 
2. Don't do insane OTM (out the money) calls unless you have a very very good reason. 
3. If you're going to do weeklies, calls should be for short squeezes or some other catalyst.  
4. Make sure you understand what implied volatility is. For ex call prices for SNDL are insane right now because it's so volatile so buying something like a $1 call would be like a $3 break even price.  This same call months before would have a break-even price much closer to $1 

Take everything I said with a grain of salt.  I'm still learning a lot and there are better more knowledgeable people here."

bicameral_mind,1612985198.0,"I mean it's up to you if you want to let it ride, if AAPL trends up in that time you stand to make money.  

As far as wash sale rule, yes it is better to let it ride and make money on the investment than to potentially claim a $900 deduction.  Remember you can only claim the deduction if you lost money *overall* across all your investments.  Any other capital gains on any other positions offset your losses on that one position.  

Moreover, a deduction is just a reduction in taxable income - so what you actually get back in real dollar terms on that loss is $900 * your tax rate.  So say your effective tax rate is 25%: $900 * .25 is $225 in IRS refund/reduction in taxes owed.  Likewise, if your new investment profits exceed the initial $900 loss, you effectively owe $225 less in taxes on that position.

In general, I guess my point is you just shouldn't think about the wash sale as part of your trading strategy in most cases."

Timbo2510,1612985391.0,"Yes but you need to be more specific when you invest in stocks.

&#x200B;

Sundial Growers is a Canada based cannabis company that distributes and produces pre rolls and vapes.

&#x200B;

With the US legalizing cannabis left and right, and the new Biden administration it looks like the weed market is going to have a really good year.

Many cannabis companies in Canada can expand. Look into HEXO, ACB, TLRY, CRON, CGC

&#x200B;

Especially Tilray it went up 130% within one week.

&#x200B;

They all just shooting to the moon. It's a good time to get into it.

If you have a choice. Don't bet on GME. Use that money wisely and invest it into something that actually has a future lol"

zhululu,1612985738.0,"Every time it got close there was massive sell orders on the L2 that buyers would have to buy through in order for it to keep rising.

Sometimes tards like us have a dollar amount in mind on when to take profit. Rarely do you pick a number like $2.43. You pick a nice even number like $2.50. So you’ll often get these walls of orders ready to go at big even numbers like that. They can put a stop to momentum but... if you clear through them there likely isn’t a lot of sell pressure on the other side and the price will boing faster than my 12 year old dick when I got my first Sears catalog."

option-trader,1612985835.0,"That could be true. But, I've seen a lot of new users around. My oldest just added Chegg, and he might be subscribed for 4 years at the way he uses Chegg. I believe their new subscribers were pushed here from the virus situation. Their growth should stay consistent as more and more users sign up. I don't think they've been able to penetrate the high school level yet, so there's potential there.

As for the price target, it was more about their recent earning report. That was a solid number with 6.6M users at end of Q4, up from 3.7M at end of Q3. That should easily be a 10pt pop from $102 up into $110-$115 range. That's why I grabbed the $105 calls. I wanted to see if that was possible by the end of next week."

throwmeaway_2,1612985865.0,"dipping my toes in options, so forgive the small values.

Bought SNDL 3c for 2/12.  Price was $0.45 and I bought 3 contracts + fees = $138 total

Obviously price is close to $3 now.  Looks like I can sell the option for $0.55 for total of $165.  If I did that immediately, it would essentially be locking in $27 profit.

If I wait and say SNDL increases, I'm more ITM and whatever it ends at EOD Friday closes out the option.  Say it ends at $3.50, then I get the $0.50 ""profit"" for 300 shares = $150 profit.

If it goes down and closes below $3 Friday, whether it's $2.98 or $1.98, the option expires and I'm out the initial $138 investment.  If it's hovering at say $2.75 late in the day Friday, it's also essentially worthless since no one would be buying my option that close to expiration.

Is that all basically correct?  Plenty of experience passivley investing over time, but trying to add some brain wrinkles on the active trading ^^to ^^YOLO ^^my ^^GME ^^losses ^^of ^^course"

These are all ""cheap"" stocks with a very promising year. When I say look into it I mean actually LOOK into it before you invest. All these might be up a chunk already but these are definitely runners. Let's be real.... you don't have to read the entire companies history. Just do some Youtube videos, to begin with and go from there haha

Pharma, cannabis, and EV industry are taking over. This is the year.

Just a piece of personal advice. If you want to grow your portfolio, maybe it's a good time to reevaluate your gambling position and actually start investing in something that will make your portfolio 5x. Companies that actually has a promising future... not GME lol

TLRY alone is up 130% within a week. Pharma stocks are all exploding, CCIV merger is speculation but when that's confirmed it'll double the price within days. CCIV is already up 300% and the merger hasn't even happened yet.

Anyway, hope everyone is making banks this year. Stop chasing dead stocks! lol"

schitaco,1612986236.0,"Yes that's correct. Typically you want to sell your options before they expire, unless they're ITM and you want the shares. That's because you can take advantage of the extrinsic (time) value of the option, which is basically represented by IV.

If you think it'll keep running by all means hold on, but if you think otherwise sell pretty soon because IV will go down if the stock loses momentum. You basically bought a high IV option on a hot stock which is a not great play for huge gains."

SmallUser,1612986349.0," U.S. Weed > Canadian Weed

I'll keep it simple.

* POSITIVE margins
* Larger market (by multiples)
* More favorable regulation
   * Only limited licenses available so pricing is rational
   * Vertically integrated
   * Once U.S. investment managers can invest, these things will be crushing their benchmarks and they'll be FORCED to buy (think Fidelity, T. Rowe, etc.)
* Growing \~20% QoQ (100% YoY)
* All of of them trading at 5-10x revenue (or less)
* Some ideas: AYR Strategies (about to become a top 5 player after a deal, Med Men, Harborside, Harvest Growth). ALL of these are \~$1bn market cap only, profitable, and growing **(HRVSF, AYRWF,  MMNFF,  HBORF)**"

I don't see them becoming a major distributor all of a sudden. its definitely benefiting from the industry as a whole blowing up right now. it will get another boost when it gets into Nasdaq in the next couple of days then I expect it settle down until actual news on legalization comes.

ProgrammaticallyHip,1612986661.0,"*Stocks like recent IPO Sundial Growers (SNDL) and OrganiGram Holdings (OGI) have market caps near $1 billion while Zenabis Global is only worth $200 million. The company has the capital plans in place to reach capacity of 143,200 kg, recently increased by 12,000 kg due to harvests that have consistently exceeded capacity designs.*

kdogb777,1612987067.0,In on some PLTR
lurkwhenbored,1612987067.0,"# Market arbitrage with APHA and TLRY

##TLRY do reverse merger with APHA

“Under terms of the merger deal, Aphria shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each Aphria share they own, while Tilray shareholders will see no adjustment to their holdings.”

##APHA should be worth 83% of TLRY instead of being valued at about 46% of TLRY 

APHA = 30 CAD = 23 USD
(23 / 50) = 0.46

So the difference between the two is the profit made (50 - 23 = 27) multiplied by the share given (0.83) (27 * 0.83 = 22.41)

# Guaranteed $22.41 USD per share of APHA at current prices

## Disclaimer: APHA has a market arbitrage opportunity, but remember it relies on TLRY maintaining it's current high value. If you don't think it will, you should sell APHA rather than wait for the merger."

Since then they have fixed their quality issue, they have no debt, they distribute in all of Canada and where they can in the US. Have great profits. Legalization looks to be incoming. I seriously don’t understand it being a “meme” stock or anywhere close to overvalued.

That’s a .43/1 ratio. So by buying 1 APHA stock you’re essentially getting 2x your money in TLRY once the merge happens in 2 months. 

Either APHA shoots up to match that .83/1 ratio or TLRY comes down. Why bet on the one that could go down. Bet on the one that guarantees you either a win or a break even."

SugaryPlumbs,1612987645.0,It means they are at risk of being removed from trading on the NASDAQ. It happens if a stock remains with a bid price under $1.00 for 30 consecutive days. Most companies just do a reverse split to increase the price of individual shares to avoid it if the price doesn't go up enough.

NrdRage,1612988149.0,"# OK,  time for some real talk, apes (no, really, gather round):

SNDL was fun.  Check my history, I was  playing it with you because it's always fun to play a garbage stock and  move the numbers around a bit.  But it's gonna hurt a lot of you Ganja  Gorillas if you stick around trying to keep milking it.

Fact  is, it's kind of a garbage company with no long term outlook and  they've proven time and again they're willing to dilute their  shareholders into nothing by releasing a billion + shares.

Almost  all of you are well into the profits on this thing right now, which  means you can afford to roll out of this and roll into something that's  not likely to turn on you like $APHA, $TLRY, $ACB, or even OGI (maybe  especially OGI if you want to keep playing with low strike price stocks)  that all have real plans besides ""we sell skunk weed with plastic  filler because it makes it cheaper"".

The  weed party is still going if you want it to, but put down the Dorito's  for a couple minutes and think about how more money = higher quality  weed, then move your money to higher quality weed.  Plus, those other  rockets have hot tubs and edibles.TL

LumpyFishstick,1612988284.0,Yeah look at some of the DD that has been done on this sub. post merger you get .83 TLRY for each APHA stock you own. Right now the ratio is about .44. So either TLRY goes down or APHA goes up to match (in which case its about 2:1). APHA is the buy right now if youre debating between the two imo. Do your own DD though!

FrancisCharlesBacon,1612988289.0,"To all the trading noobs, no stock goes up 100% of the time. Whenever it gets above 70-90 on the RSI it needs time to cool off and come back down a bit before climbing higher. This is most visible on the daily chart. This is generally the best time to buy if you believe the stock will continue to climb in the coming week/month. Have a long term focus of more than a day and it will keep you from panic selling and missing out on gains."

qdolobp,1612988858.0,"I’ll say it again for all you slow readers. 

Hey you idiots. TLRY and APHA are merging. For every 1 APHA stock you get .83 TLRY. You do the current math. Why would you buy TLRY? APHA is $26. TLRY is $60. That’s a .43/1 ratio. So by buying 1 APHA stock you’re essentially getting 2x your money in TLRY once the merge happens in 2 months.

Either APHA shoots up to match that .83/1 ratio or TLRY comes down. Why bet on the one that could go down. Bet on the one that guarantees you either a win or a break even."

Also if you have been holding since 2018 that means you have been bagholding since 2018.  Is it really a boom to hit 2018 levels?

Which means APHA should be .81x the price of TLRY. Instead it’s .43 right now. AKA you can buy double the TLRY for the price of 1. You enjoy not making money or something?

It is the safest investment this side of your mom. Long sony. Oh and fuck retarded PE ratios like Peloton with their 535 times earnings valuation. Would you rather own Peloton at 535 times earnings or Sony at 15 times. How about in a correction? If your answer is Peloton you are tripping."

No shit they are inversely correlated, it’s still a high correlation based on magnitude - not direction but apparently you are too simple minded to put 1 + 1 together."

tryhardfit,1612989846.0,"What if they both start dropping? TLRY and APHA could both lose 50% of their MC tomorrow.  Suddenly you will get a better deal than having owned TLRY, but the arbitrage won't have happened since you'll still be far behind.  (I was assuming you were trying to do arbitrage, if you just want to buy the stock then ya, APHA is better than TLRY right now).

&#x200B;

If you want to arbitrage, if you buy 100 shares of apha it costs you 2600. If you sell 80 shares of TLRY it will get you $4800. In total you will have 100 shares of apha, negative 80 shares of tlry and $2200.  When the shares merge the 100 shares of apha will become 80 shares of tlry and they will cancel each other out.  You will be left with $2200 with no risk (except the risk that the deal falls through)."

DongMeatSandwiches,1612989903.0,Can someone explain how APHA is only up 10% while TLRY is up 50%?
LisleSwanson,1612989904.0," TLRY and APHA are merging. For every 1 APHA stock you get .83 TLRY. You do the current math. Why would you buy TLRY? APHA is $26. TLRY is $60. That’s a .43/1 ratio. So by buying 1 APHA stock you’re essentially getting 2x your money in TLRY once the merge happens in 2 months. 

Either APHA shoots up to match that .83/1 ratio or TLRY comes down. Why bet on the one that could go down. Bet on the one that guarantees you either a win or a break even."

Their value is going to equilibrate around the arbitrage terms. Yeah APHA would be better for the long term just because the buy-in for TLRY is overpriced, but you aint making gains just avoiding losses.

also, CGC owns APHA so they will increase as well. They literally had to add 10$ more space to the calls cause they blew them through the roof"

But TLRY is also about to moon. Holding until I think it peaks, selling, then buying back it when it comes down for the long hold.

So I mean by all means buy APHA, but expect to be holding it - it's a true value play, one I plan to get in after I (hopefully) make it out with my tendies at the top of TLRY."

Right now it's not.  Which means one of two things:

&#x200B;

Either APHA goes up (good for APHA, has no effect on TLRY) or

&#x200B;

TLRY goes down (neutral for APHA, bad for TLRY).

Superfluous_GGG,1612991227.0,"No worries man. Nio is a legit great company to hold. I missed the boat on it's early rise, but holding it for the past three months and it's always done me well. There's a lot of great stuff in Nio - great cars, some of the best EV tech going, visionary CEO, great early sales, China is back to buying cars big time, potential roll out in Europe 2021/22 and rumours about the US swirling. It's a long term boring play for me, but everything I've seen would indicate it's going to $90-100 this year easy and a great future ahead."

the_glutton17,1612991228.0,"Brokers match up bid prices to ask prices, when they match a sale is made.  Your bid price of 30 dollars matched up to someone's ask price of 30 dollars so the sale was made, even though the average ask to bid price was 28.

A market order means it'll buy or sell at whatever the price is at that moment.

Why would you set a limit for 30 dollars anyways?  If you're gonna buuy the stock you want the lowest price possible.  It was basically on sale for 2 bucks less, but you insisted on paying full price.

Edit: not trying to be mean, but that's one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.  You might want to do some more research into the market before playing with real money."

fwoot_fwies,1612991645.0,"🚨 To all the new people in here during/post-GME:

No, this wasn’t a pullback nor a drop, nor even so much as a blip on the 6-month chart. However, if you actually use your brain and look at the June pullback, September & October pullbacks...THOSE are pullbacks. 

Expect at minimum another re-test of the SPY 50 Day MA before you see an influx of buyers. If you’re completely long with no protection, you deserve to get slaughtered like the pig you are after the run we just had.

> Aphria will get a 62% stake in new Tilray, old Tilray will get a 38% stake. To account for this split, Aphria owners will receive 0.8381 shares for each APHA share they own. Tilray stock holders will not see any changes to their holdings. There is arbitrage/free tendies because the APHA to TLRY ratio is lower than 0.8381.

TLRY will have to come down in price or APHA will have to come up to meet it. Both of these result in more value for APHA shares, no?"

faithandthemuse,1612993074.0,"That, I can't really comment on. I looked at their quarterly reports, their balance sheet, brands, partnerships, etc. Seems like a sound choice to me. 

My thinking is with their rapid revenue growth in California alone, legalization will pave the way for them to expand across the US quickly. Their jump in sales tell me people really like their products, so that might give them a competitive edge.

Honestly, the whole weed market is bonkers right now, so I'm finding it hard to jump in with confidence. So many stocks are sky high already, and others are low but deserve to go up. But, they might not go uo simply because of the current hype around a few companies."

The weed bears roared loudly, years after counting their tendies in silent isolation (being the only species of bear that possesses any tendies). The cnbc boomers once again blamed reddit for the increase in weed stonk prices, proving to themselves thar they are the true ♿ at the top of the food chain.

thegininyou,1612997857.0,"You'd be paying $2910 for the right to buy NIO at $32 
So that's $3200+2910 = 6110
Let's say the current price of NIO is 61.30
Meaning a $100 shares is 6130 
If you decided to buy this contract you'd make $20 if nothing happened to the stock.

Most people buy and sell contacts.  Its all I've done honestly. 
The only reason I could think to exercise a contract would be because you like the stock (like TSLA) and think it'll go up and want to own the stock instead of the contract. I'm sure there are other high level plays like exercising the contract to sell calls way OTM or something of that nature but I'm not very familiar with them. 

Just so you know (I know you're just using it as an example) buying that call doesn't really make sense to me.

You should look up strategies for buying options or even use sites that show you your best options."

So with that said, that’s why you hear all these “APHA is better” or “SNDL is better” a lot of them are uneducated and it’s just confirmation bias.

That’s not to take away from some who are actually very intelligent and did their DD. Some honestly believe it, and that’s totally fine. I’m not saying TLRY is better, just saying why there’s a lot of spam like that.

Regardless, ALL weed stocks are performing right now and I’m so happy for all you motherfuckers printing money. If you’re not playing weed by now, sorry, but you’re honestly a moron.

110k up in a day was nice and of course followed up with a 60k down day.

The great thing about both of them was I was happy on the up day but not too happy and the down day I was not sad (and I do mean great thing, both are extremely important to trading smoothly).

Its the most difficult part about trading is to not let emotions get in the way, I am not there but I am a way ahead of where I used to be.

coffetech,1613005042.0,"The number of total shares was much less compared to today.  [SNDL Shares Outstanding History](https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/?symbol=sndl) If this website is correct then SNDL had 100 million shares when it was $11.5 making its market cap 1.5 billion. Market cap = total of amount of shares value $

&#x200B;

Today SNDL has  1.4 billion shares, which's' 14x the amount of shares. with a market cap of almost 5 billion dollars.

&#x200B;

If you adjusted for the old shares SNDL would be worth $50 a share. THAT'S FUCKING INSANE, nothing can justify its current price, it's not a matter of if but when it will crash. BE VERY CAREFUL it could take day/s, or week/s.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Here is something to think about. Fucking, Wendys is worth 5 billion, its revenue is 1.6 billion yearly.

SNDL is worth 5 billion, it's revenue is < 100 million.

I just feel like it’s better safe than sorry personally.

raharley0,1613032485.0,To exercise the option it has to be above the strike price. But you can sell it at any point. Of course once it’s gone back below the strike it’s worth much less

iamsabriel,1613058450.0,"So with the warning that I’m so new to DD that no one should listen to me at all, I’ve been looking at oil and related industry since you gave this tip. Again, I don’t know what I’m doing and am using all of this to learn, but with that said, 

Look at MTZ. They just announced earnings coming at the end of the month. Trending up. One analyst said it’s expected to rise 58% in the next three months. Could there be momentum for this type of company based off of oil doing well in earnings report next week? Is this a good option to be looking at March calls?

I’m probably completely off. I haven’t learned to think about this stuff correctly to identify a good buy.  This is practice.  Hope I’m not bothering you. I just think your posts have more thought behind them than most I’ve seen."

Now it may still have plenty of potential into the future to be an accepted form of payment for various goods or services, but if used in that context one might trip into a double tax situation: a capital gains tax on the way out of the asset, and a sales tax in procurement of a good or service.

GiraffeStyle,1613156366.0,got up to $1K per contract. Hope you sold some.
discombobulantics,1613168111.0,Yes you will. Unless you have more than 25k in your account. Doesn’t matter if you use margin or not. Don’t listen to some whose name is “learningoptions” lol
learningoptions,1613177144.0,"Really.  In a cash account, no margin.  Huh."
discombobulantics,1613180866.0,Yep. Have you made a round trip yet? You’ll get a notification of how many more you can make. You get 4 in a 5 day period. Unless your account is worth more than 25k.
learningoptions,1613181785.0,"That hasn't been my experience, and when I was concerned about it I called TDA to confirm.  I was told as long as I wasn't using unsettled cash, it wasn't an issue.  

I also researched it, note the part about cash accounts. PDT only applies to margin accounts: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_day_trader#:~:text=A%20FINRA%20rule%20applies%20to,but%20not%20to%20cash%20accounts.

I'm not new to this, by a stretch, though I am actively studying *every day*, and I'm wrong often.  But I'm pretty sure I'm not wrong about this.

Edit: not to put too fine a point on it, perhaps dismissing someone with the word ""learning"" in their username isnt a great idea.  It implies they're working at something."
discombobulantics,1613188003.0,"Nor am I you sound like a pompous ass though. Your answer “no” to his question is not correct unless he means a cash account, all he said was he isn’t using margin. Not sure who uses a cash account entirely unapproved for margin, you’re in your own little league there my friend. If that’s what he meant, then you’re correct. That’s not what he asked though. And the vast majority of people here are trading options, aka approved for margin on TD Ameritrade"
learningoptions,1613191529.0,"Plenty of people use cash-only accounts to get around the PDT rule, it’s a standard reply to the question about how to get around the rule. 

Also: if you’re in a margin account, you’re using margin. Take a look at the buying power effect in your portfolio, or when you’re placing a trade; some stocks you’re paying full, others it only has a partial impact on your buying buying power.  If OP means he isn’t using the additional buying power that a margin account affords, then they don’t understand margin accounts.

Oh, and you’re *assuming* they’re trading options, but lately they could just as easily been trading shares.  I mean, we do have millions more ppl here now.

You’re also assuming I’m using a cash-only account.  Nope.  Have one, don’t use it.  I use my margin account

One other thing.  To do the full range of options plays, yes you do need a margin account, but:


“How to Avoid Option Margin Requirements
Certain option positions do not require margins. For example, there are no margin requirements for long options, whether they are puts or calls. In other instances, traders can use several different strategies to avoid option margin requirements.”

I don’t know, man, maybe I am the asshole here.

Powerful_Business,1612796233.0,"Your communist alliance collapsed, remember 1991, your mother failed to raise you, your father thinks you're a disgrace.

You will never be a real woman. You have no womb, you have no ovaries, you have no eggs. You are a homosexual man twisted by drugs and surgery into a crude mockery of nature’s perfection.

All the “validation” you get is two-faced and half-hearted. Behind your back people mock you. Your parents are disgusted and ashamed of you, your “friends” laugh at your ghoulish appearance behind closed doors.

Men are utterly repulsed by you. Thousands of years of evolution have allowed men to sniff out frauds with incredible efficiency. Even trannies who “pass” look uncanny and unnatural to a man. Your bone structure is a dead giveaway. And even if you manage to get a drunk guy home with you, he’ll turn tail and bolt the second he gets a whiff of your diseased, infected axe wound.

You will never be happy. You wrench out a fake smile every single morning and tell yourself it’s going to be ok, but deep inside you feel the depression creeping up like a weed, ready to crush you under the unbearable weight.

Eventually it’ll be too much to bear - you’ll buy a rope, tie a noose, put it around your neck, and plunge into the cold abyss. Your parents will find you, heartbroken but relieved that they no longer have to live with the unbearable shame and disappointment. They’ll bury you with a headstone marked with your birth name, and every passerby for the rest of eternity will know a man is buried there. Your body will decay and go back to the dust, and all that will remain of your legacy is a skeleton that is unmistakably male.

This is your fate. This is what you chose. There is no turning back."

GuardingxCross,1612797670.0,"I got a question about Robinhood

BoomerImpairedShtSux,1612806551.0,Glad we had this conversation.  Already made me some money.  Thank you.
techblackops,1612806719.0,Ha! Yeah my best one right now is GRWG in case you haven't seen it. I've had it for about 3 weeks and so far have made 20.08%. I bought up a bunch of weed stocks right before the inauguration.
BoomerImpairedShtSux,1612806939.0,Sweet moves.  Yeah just threw a grand at MJ because why not but glad I did.  Good times.

TheMariannWilliamson,1612814907.0,A ton of the OG users are in private subs or discord now. I have a feeling it won't ever be the same again because they gave up on it.
TheMariannWilliamson,1612815436.0,oops

HanSupreme,1612840475.0,You still need a reason?
qdolobp,1612840561.0,I did 3 days ago. Would’ve been nice if you told me then considering I was asking lol
HanSupreme,1612840680.0,"I told you the day of, and mentioned it going to moon come March lol. You just had to do your DD my friend, and you would’ve found your why lol.

I was speaking in code because I read HedgeFunds now have a bot that tracks ticker symbols on Reddit, and I didn’t want HedgeFunds seeing / manipulating again.

Anyways, still plenty of time. I hope you’ve jumped in and are making some gains. The March partnership announcement is still a long way. After that it should moon. But it looks to be on track to hit 10ish by then."
qdolobp,1612840746.0,If I sat down and did DD for every “buy *blank*” comment on here I’d die before I ever had time to actually buy anything
kk7766,1612844382.0,Sold half of them for 400% gain today. We were the only ones ;)

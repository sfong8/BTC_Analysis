alfapredator,1613474697.0,"There are a few concepts that you are getting wrong.

1) Equities do not need to sell off when bond yields rise - in fact the correlation between the two has been positive for quite a while now.

2) Bonds sell off on inflation EXPECTATION. Commodities inflation has not spilled over into the CPI basket yet, and will not be reflected until 2-3 months from now. Not to mention the fact that price levels are higher today compared to a year ago while an output gap is still present (i.e. GDP was higher a year ago). Think about what happens when the economy actually reopens.

3) The debate has never been about what the CPI number is today or a month from now (actually CPI will be very high YoY for the next couple months because of the absolute shitshow that last March/April has been), it's actually about whether structural inflation will remain due to a rebound in money velocity via fiscal stimulus."

HesselbachsTriangle,1613475045.0,So I may be wrong but it's my understanding LGVW will be re-named BFLY as they are bringing the company Butterfly to the market. Both stocks are currently not supported as the deal just finalized last week. Today (prob around market open 930-1030ish) we should be able to see/trade BFLY if all goes to plan. So if you are in LGVW then you should now own BFLY as of today.

We have to handle this emergency alongside an easier health crisis that was already too hard for us. This will not be resolved in the easily foreseeable future, the only opportunities in sight to solve it are distant and fuzzy.

[Projected 623% growth over the next 3 months](https://stockinvest.us/stock/ABML) with 90% probability of holding between $18-$36. Currently at $4. Up over 6000% in last year.

They are building a new plant down the road from Tesla. They recycle lithium  batteries in an environmentally safe manner, which is going to boom over the next few years. C-suite is former Tesla and Facebook execs. Get in now or you’ll miss out. Could be a $300+ over the next few years.

Upcoming catalysts;

-Uplisting to NASDAQ

-Name and Ticker change to “Technology company”

-Ground breaking on new “small” factory min from Tesla. Will be able to process there 1/4 of what the world did in 2019."

His bb call might have been worth $10 a month ago, thirty days from expiration. 

Today, with, say, for example, ten days to expiration, it will undoubtedly be worth less (unless the strike price was in or near the money, of course). But just like a stock, an option is still sale able."

They announced their share buyback program. Meaning that the amount of float will be lower increasing market value when outstanding remaining shares are brought.

Target Price is 29.93.

This is going to be a pretty big miss for late investor hoping to get in while it’s cheaper now as by May-June if the market continues to perform it should be mid-thirties to forties based on trend and sentiment."

I spent maybe 10 mins getting it back then and it's worth like $15 today.

[Projected 623% growth over the next 3 months](https://stockinvest.us/stock/ABML) with 90% probability of holding between $18-$36. Currently at $4. Up over 6000% in last year.

They are building a new plant down the road from Tesla. They recycle lithium  batteries in an environmentally safe manner, which is going to boom over the next few years. C-suite is former Tesla and Facebook execs. Get in now or you’ll miss out. Could be a $300+ over the next few years.

Upcoming catalysts;

-Uplisting to NASDAQ

-Name and Ticker change to “Technology company”

-Ground breaking on new “small” factory min from Tesla. Will be able to process there 1/4 of what the world did in 2019."

It was worth it at $40. It’s damn worth it at sub $30. Stop being idiots controlled by emotion and remember the scripture: “when others are greedy be fearful. When others are fearful be greedy”. 

Ask yourself this. Is PLTR a shit ass company that was only a meme like SNDL? No. It’s a legit company with a legit plan. So when you see a dip like this you buy. I swear you guys wouldn’t buy apple if it hit $100 today."

brbcripwalking,1613481870.0,"Dear Robinhood customer service, 

You’re not going to believe this but someone hacked into my account and bought a bunch of PLTR at $38.15 and loaded up on weekly calls.

They somehow got access to my email, password, and used my finger print to log in somehow.

This sick bastard even knew my mother’s maiden name and the name of my first childhood pet.

Then they used my Robinhood Debit card to buy a bunch of PLTR merchandise. Who would do something like that?

Anyways please refund my money ASAP, rent is due soon and I’m looking at a margin call.

Thanks!

*""Under the terms of the deal, shareholders will receive 0.8381 Tilray shares for each share owned.*

*Thus, using TLRY's closing price of US$29 on 2/12, this would mean APHAshares would be worth C$31,"" said Zuanic. Cantor is not expecting the deal terms to be renegotiated but rather views the gap as a result of recent volatility in Canadian cannabis stocks with Tilray the most liquid given its Nasdaq listing.""*

barelyrolling42069v2,1613483812.0,"Okay, but here's my counter argument:

Back in May, I flew twice, both times across the country. flights were about a quarter of the price that they usually are and there was no one in the airport. so this made sense as to why airlines were only half of the price that they used to be on the stock market. Now fast forward to October when I took a flight. Things seem to be bouncing back, the prices were up a little bit, a little bit harder to find the flights, and there were more people in the airport. Fast forward to January when I took a flight. all the airports  were completely jam-packed, couldn't find a seat at the bar, flights were double the price that they used to be. Fast forward to yesterday. trying to buy a flight, prices were jacked out of proportion, hard to find the flight that I want, and this is for something that I'm doing in a couple weeks. In all of this time, the stock price is really haven't got up very much yet reality has changed quite significantly. For this reason I feel as though the current stock price is undervalued, either that or the airlines were in a bubble before the pandemic which I don't necessarily believe."

All potstocks I'm watching are green somewhere between 5%-10% in PM. There is a lot of momentum from investors behind this industry. Last week we saw a rocket because of meme stock hype, and FOMO buyers, then a bubble correction. We now return to our regular scheduled program of steady gains."

bagtf3,1613484060.0,They cut the number of flights so their planes didn't have to fly half full and lose money on fuel. A good percentage of their planes are sitting empty. They schedule the remaining flights to major hubs and at busy times of the day so they're available to the largest number of people. Just because you take a flight and your plane is full doesn't mean the airline is at max capacity and all their planes are running 24/7 at capacity.

crungington,1613507361.0,"I think it’s mainly the new CFO, but I’m excited about them getting increasingly involved in space exploration (nuclear-propulsion engines for spacecraft). 

They’ve had a partnership with Virgin Galactic for awhile and recently announced a partnership with the UK Space Agency. Beyond that, they are in the running to produce new B52 Engines for the US Air Force and recently announced intentions to build the first ever fully electric aircraft. 

There is a real risk of bankruptcy, but I do not see the UK government allowing a company like RR to fold. The other risk would be an especially slow or insignificant recovery for aviation, but I personally don’t anticipate that. I have high hopes for RYCEY as a long-term hold.

They announce earnings next month. It will probably be a safer time to invest following that announcement, but you may miss out on some gainz in the interim period."

wallawalla_,1613507932.0,"hmm, interesting. I'm looking at this from the t1 perspective rather than t2. There's certainly a much larger t2 population. The sensors are good for 90 days, not 180, but your point does stand about less hassle for the end user, other than the insertion/replacement process.

My doc mentioned their product to me about 9 months ago, but I turned it down. I've heard stories of the sensor failing prematrurely. I don't find managing the external sensors all that much of a hassle. If there's an issue, I can easily replace the sensor. If there was an issue with the implant, I would need to go into the doctors office which would remove the convenience. 

I'm not hating on it by any means. It's awesome that they're becoming competitive in the cgm market. Expanding into the t2 population is going to be critical. Has that been something discussed during earnings calls? I'll listen to the last couple of those to get an idea of their strategy."

arandomnewyorker,1613508781.0,"Palantir Lays Out Growth Targets Following Public Debut

BY Dow Jones \&amp; Company, Inc.  
— 3:51 PM ET 02/16/2021

Palantir Technologies Inc. ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) shares dropped sharply Tuesday after the data-mining company laid out its expectations for revenue growth over the next few years and said it would beef up its sales force.

Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) has joined a cohort of firms whose market debuts have been welcomed by many investors, some of whom are looking for technology-driven companies to grow rapidly to justify their valuations. The Denver-based company, which provides software focused on helping businesses as well as defense and intelligence agencies analyze data, saw its shares rise from a $10 debut in a direct listing in September to as high as $39 in late January, according to FactSet.

The stock has fallen since then and traded down about 12% to $28.05 Tuesday afternoon, as executives said they expect Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) to generate revenue growth of more than 30% annually over the next five years. That rate could potentially be slower than the 47% gain it recorded for 2020 compared with 2019.

The company isn't ""focused on the day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, near-term focus that, quite frankly, destroys businesses,"" said Chief Executive Officer Alexander Karp. ""It's one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech, are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients,"" he added.

Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) plans to expand its sales team by triple-digit levels this year, operations chief Shyam Sankar told investors Tuesday.

Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) executives said the company reached deals with corporate clients including miner Rio Tinto PLC, utility Pacific Gas and Electric and oil giant BP PLC. They also said Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) would push to expand its work with the federal government, noting recent agreements with the U.S. Army.

Palantir ([PLTR](https://snapshot.fidelity.com/fidresearch/snapshot/landing.jhtml?symbol=PLTR#/research)) reported a narrower fourth-quarter loss of $148.3 million, or 8 cents a share, on $322.1 million in revenue. For 2020 as a whole, it lost $1.17 billion on about $1.1 billion in revenue. Stock-based compensation was a major expense last year, the company said."

the funds are so large now and ARK owns so much of the underlying that when people pile into ARK it actually raises the price of everything inside of the fund, which brings more investors in because they see prices going up so they pile in harder etc.

if investors pull out of ARK it will have the opposite effect of tanking much harder than everything else"

No profit for 18 years, so what? 18 years ago, even Bill Gates and Steve Jobs probably didn't know what Big Data was. Karp and Thil were way ahead of their time.

Now they seem to have their product at a point where it is so mature that more money is spent on marketing than on research and development.

The considerable number of contracts they have signed in the last few weeks, not only with the government, but with companies from the private sector, shows that there is a real demand for their product.

Especially the partnership with IBM should push the reach of Palantir enormously and thus lead to a clear earlier profitability.

Of course, I could be wrong, that's the beauty of the stock market. You never know how it will turn out. However, I would by no means call PLTR a meme stock.

to be fair though, there aren't many stocks that aren't wildly overvalued anymore thanks to the retarded ass fed

tldr; don't buy anything for fundamentals in this busted ass market, if you look under the hood of almost every company in the market you will realize you paid top dollar for dog poop, im in the market too but i aint married to anything, im out of this shithole when the fed says they are thinking about thinking of raising interest rates or ending QE"

InIce1234,1613511782.0,"Since you call the Fed ""retarded ass fed"", I assume that you are not satisfied with the monetary policy.   
Funnily enough, I notice that more and more people think that inflation is something evil and that the Fed's actions are totally wrong. Also, the fear of a crash is growing in many people. But is this fear really justified?   
What has changed from a microeconomic point of view? Of course, many companies have problems due to the pandemic, but there are also really big winners (you surely know who they are). So there has only been a transfer of earnings. 

What has changed from a macroeconomic point of view? Exactly the FED has lowered the interest rate and is using quantitative easing. (BTW not only the FED but the whole world is at 0 interest rate). 

This is enough to confirm the current level of the stock market. 

A look at Europe and Japan shows how long a period of low interest rates can last. In Japan since 1995 and in Europe since 2008. 

No the U.S. is not omnipotent either and will not be able to raise interest rates again just like that, especially not after the enormous increase in the national debt and the Democrats in power, who traditionally continue to drive up the national debt. 

TLDR: The markets are at a relatively expected level under current circumstances and no change in monetary policy is expected for a long time."

""we’re providing long-term guidance pretty radical in the sense that we are committing to keeping a growth threshold of above 30% for the next five years, but not focused on the day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter near-term focus that quite frankly destroys businesses is one of the main reasons why so many of our businesses, especially in tech are actually only serving Wall Street and not serving their clients and not serving an everyday investor and generate suboptimal returns over time, because they too are lacking indicator of the suboptimal performance.""

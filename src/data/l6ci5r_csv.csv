Top-Brief3444,1611776893.0,WE NEED TO AGREE ON BB OR NOK. I SAY BB BECAUSE ITS CURRENTLY NOT BROKEN. Blow this shit up you loser worthless degenerates. Let’s decide
Ozymandias-97,1611776893.0,"$BBBY, $BBBY and more fucking $BBBY. 

Here’s some quick DD.

1. Short Interest

$BBBY has a short interest of 67%. 67 fucking percent. The hedge funds want this stock dead and buried. GME had a short interest of 142%, hence its rally. 67% is not far off.

2. Market Cap

$BBBY's market cap is $5bn. GME's had a market cap of $9bn just a few days ago. There is tremendous amounts of room for growth and upwards movement. $BBBY’s a sleeping giant.

3. PB Ratio

$BBBY's price to book ratio is 3.2. Right now Tesla's is 50 and GME's is 30. This shows clear fucking upside potential and we haven't even gotten started yet. $BBBY's PB ratio is fucking cheap.

4. Financials

$BBBY's net income increased in the last quarter of 2021 and is showing an upward trajectory. Also 33% gross margin and a 6% ROI. Positive fucking financials so you're not investing in some company that's financially bleeding. Hell, they even pay dividends, grab your gain and pocket some cash while you’re at it.

5. P/E Ratio

Not even gonna sugarcoat this one, 7.9.
 7 point fucking 9. Undervalued and extremely cheap. Tesla's PE Ratio is at 1,685. GME's is currently unavailable cause you retards shot it through the roof but I guarantee it's fucking high.

TL;DR: Household name, undervalued, high short interest, positive financials and a low market cap. Hop on the fucking $BBBY spaceship and see you retards on mars 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌🏻"

JUST HAVE FAITH AND DONT BE SCARED OF THE LITTLE SPEED BUMPS!

MAKE NO MISTAKE. GME IS THE HOLY GRAIL

The huge spike in anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda, and bots shilling other stocks today should give you 100% confidence that this GME squeeze has not yet even begun. We HOLD for ourselves. We HOLD for our families! We HOLD for each other. HOLD THE LINE!!!!!!!

Remain calm. Don't watch the ticker or the news too much today if you can help it.

If these fuckers had covered by now, they would no longer have skin in the game and would not be putting so much time, money and energy into this anti-WSB, anti-GME propaganda. With every day they squirm more. They will realize in a couple days that there's no way out of this but to bend over and give a massive payout to the people. They REALLY want us to sell and are pulling out every dirty trick in the book to try to make that happen. Well all of them can all go fuck themselves because I'M NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!!!!!

There is definitely a huge spike in bots and hedge fucks in the subreddit now. THEY WANT TO SCARE YOU, THEY WANT YOU TO SELL. DO NOT LET THEM SWAY YOU AWAY FROM GME. WE ARE STILL GOING TO THE MOON, DON'T GET OFF THE SHIP RETARDS.

THE BIG SQUEEZE IS GME. ITS NOT TOO LATE TO BUY.

REMOVE YOUR LIMITS, WE'RE GOING $2000+ KEEP THE MOMENTUM UP TARDS

Someone posted this yesterday but I repeat if you love tendies.

Melvin is fucked. Plotkin is a great stock picker but he made a big mistake. Melvin says they closed out their position. We don’t believe it. They have to sell assets, like crazy. How do we get them on the other side, and profit while doing it? Buy puts.

LB is one of their largest holdings.

“Average volume of LB is 3m shares. Melvin sold 1M in an hour and tanked the share price 10% on Monday. Melvin owns 25M shares of LB, or 1/9th of the entire float.”

LB 2/5 30p rocket 🚀 this play is already up 20,000% today alone

ubeen,1611777596.0,"Market cap is stupid high. 

So at 7$ the cap is 37b

Gme 322$ the cap is 22b

So there us waaaaay more shares available in NOK compared to GME for instance. The smaller the Cap the more the stock price will change based on activity (normally not always).

It's like when a stock splits. If they do a 10:1 split and the stock was 1k now each stock is 100ea. So now ticker will say 100.00 instead of the 1000.00."

humptydumptyfrumpty,1611777672.0,"i just about threw up in my mouth earlier from the stress.

Here's some advice;

1) it's been a trying time with covid causing a lot of people to lose their jobs or other hardships underlying this rally.

2) this is a stressful time for everyone. many emotions, many life changing financial improvements for people.  don't put anything into play you can't afford to lose.  winning is great, losing because of greed or loss of fiscal sense is not.

3) Highly recommend apps such as PTSD coach from canadian and american governments.  They work well for mindfulness, deep breathing, anxiety, panic attacks, and general grounding during stressful times, not necessarily PTSD.  BREATHE.  There may not be another GME in our lifetime, but who is to say this hasn't changed investing for the better long term anyways? Focus on your mental and physical health during the next few days to keep focused and steady.  Go for a walk, spend time with the family especially after markets close.

4) Don't fucking paper hand sell below 2 or 3 grand.  Diamond hand that bitch.

&#x200B;

This has been brought to you by the better bunghole broker of America. Invest at your own risk, everyone has their own stake involved and their own path, but try and make it as good  as possible for everyone along for the ride.

>The Dow Jones Industrial Average is in selloff mode Wednesday afternoon with shares of Boeing and Walt Disney facing the biggest drops for the index. Shares of Boeing [**BA,** **-4.35%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/BA?mod=MW_story_quote) and Walt Disney [**DIS,** **-3.99%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/DIS?mod=MW_story_quote) have contributed to the blue-chip gauge's intraday decline, as the Dow [**DJIA,** **-1.92%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DJIA?mod=MW_story_quote) was most recently trading 429 points (1.4%) lower. Boeing's shares have declined $8.16 (4.0%) while those of Walt Disney have fallen $5.39, or 3.2%, combining for a roughly 89-point drag on the Dow. Also contributing significantly to the decline are Merck [**MRK,** **-3.68%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MRK?mod=MW_story_quote), Procter & Gamble [**PG,** **-3.11%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/PG?mod=MW_story_quote), and JPMorgan Chase [**JPM,** **-2.71%**](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/JPM?mod=MW_story_quote).

LISTEN TO ME. DO NOT SELL TODAY. OR ANY DAY THIS WEEK. Drops are coming. They are counting on fear to beat us. It’s the only weapon they have, but it won’t work because we are retarded. The people are finally taking the power back from these boomer hedge fund big money shorting douchebags - the same people who fucked everyone over in 2008 with CDOs and continue to fuck you over to this day.

We only have strength if we stay in this TOGETHER. HOLD THE LINE. THE SHORT SQUEEZE HASNT HAPPENED YET. Don’t pussy out you fucking idiots, we are going BALLS DEEP. The generation that perfected trash talk in COD lobbies takes shit from NOBODY. $10,000 IS NOT A MEME. I love you all you beautiful autistic bulls. Hang tight while we ride this thing into the FUCKING STRATOSPHERE.

HighronCondor,1611777722.0,Nok is the weird one in all this. All the others are small/mid cap with huge short interest. Nok is just Nok and many saw this price movement but over the year not this week. I had calls way before these bots came but sold out today thinking this is too weird. The others I’m holding because I’m confident they are squeezing and this would happen with or without the bots. But Nok may still run who knows
Asher_Duke,1611777722.0,As much as I want GME to keep boosting I think NOK is legitimately the next one. It’s going to grow with or without us so we may as well boost it to get something out of it.

SleepyBrayden,1611778155.0,"REMEMBER: Once you buy shares, you can hold them forever, for free. Shorts have to continuously pay lots of interest to keep their shares short sold.🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋🍋

There is literally no way for shorts to exit their costly positions without paying us, as long as we HOLD.💎💎💎💎💎💎🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼

Whether it happens today in a giant spike, or in small steps over the next couple months, the shorts WILL pay out.🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🚀🚀🍋🍋

As of market open, short interest was 139% of float according to S3. Which means the infinite squeeze hasn't even started yet.

BigSmokeBateman,1611778508.0,"WSB Homies - Regardless of what you are holding, this is about fucking over wall street. I'm spread evenly although I bought more NOK due to the fact that apparently I wanted to get rpd on exchange from CAD to USD to CAD. We all know what has short interest and I'd love to just see the entire Wall Street headcount burn to the ground. I've been fucked over on institutional hit pieces that had little to no basis (Hindenburg APHA hit piece) Citron.. and others. I want these guys to bleed from their pockets until they can't take out a 10 dollar loan to feed their families at Burger King. Keep up the momentum on the week. That's the news, that's the Motif. The gains are just part of it. The little man wins this time. It'll show by end of week."

Listen up retards: fundamentally little has changed about the GME situation that made us like the stock. The only difference is the 🚀 has left the launch pad and the price has gone up... WHICH WE WANTED.

HOWEVER, fundamentally, GME is still OVERLY SHORTED. Fundamentally, it cost us NOTHING to hold. It costs them EVERYTHING.

It's not like ""some 🤡S8N Ai"" has completely hacked and subdued the Ai systems that ""independent investment banks"" use to engage in last-minute hyper-trading.

That would just be crazy if you thought that.

Here's something else that's pretty crazy:

It's been said that ""millionaires don't believe in astrology; but billionaires do"".

Maybe [some of them have alternate understandings of ""knew age stuff""](https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/l6ashs/how_tptb_have_been_trolling_the_market_and/) and how they affect mar-K-👽 devlopments.

Listen up retards: fundamentally little has changed about the GME situation that made us like the stock. The only difference is the 🚀 has left the launch pad and the price has gone up... WHICH WE WANTED.

HOWEVER, fundamentally, GME is still OVERLY SHORTED. Fundamentally, it cost us NOTHING to hold. It costs them EVERYTHING.

The SQUEEZE HASN'T SQUEEZED.

Stay PATIENT. Stay STRONG.

Listen up retards: fundamentally little has changed about the GME situation that made us like the stock. The only difference is the 🚀 has left the launch pad and the price has gone up... WHICH WE WANTED.

HOWEVER, fundamentally, GME is still OVERLY SHORTED. Fundamentally, it cost us NOTHING to hold. It costs them EVERYTHING.

The SQUEEZE HASN'T SQUEEZED.

Stay PATIENT. Stay STRONG.

I_love_medicine,1611778792.0,"Hey Guys, anyone have idea when will Friday Calls be exercised? (fellow Redditor told me it depends on the bokerage but I was thinking in regards to Hedge Funds). A question regarding GME Friday Calls expiration date (my post was unfortunately removed). I do not want to sell, I have plenty of shares and I'm holding and buying more all the time <3  
I would just like to know if anyone by any chance knows when the calls are being exercised? (Friday or Monday, the first big bunch). In theory, they may be exercised even at 5 pm, after market closes. Should we expect super-peak-short squeeze on Monday then? Or still on Friday (people are talking about Friday but I just found out calls may be executed even at 5 pm).  
I'm a little bit lost on this one, help me dear autists <3

Cheers and many good days ahead!  
PS. If I'm braking some guidelines I am deeply sorry, that was not my intention! Cheers!"

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

#WE LIKE THE STOCK

#KEEP HOLDING UNTIL THEY FEEL THE PAIN, WHETHER THAT'S FRIDAY OR NEXT WEEK

Listen up retards: fundamentally little has changed about the GME situation that made us like the stock. The only difference is the 🚀 has left the launch pad and the price has gone up... WHICH WE WANTED.

HOWEVER, fundamentally, GME is still OVERLY SHORTED. Fundamentally, it cost us NOTHING to hold. It costs them EVERYTHING.

The SQUEEZE HASN'T SQUEEZED.

Stay PATIENT. Stay STRONG.

Citizen_of_Danksburg,1611779139.0,"Got 20 shares of AMC and 10 of BB, 11 NOK. 

I could only afford to get 5 shares of GME at 100 and have been diamond holding those. BB and AMC are more long term holds anyways. Once my GME shares get maxed out, I’m selling and probably dumping them 50/50 into BB and AMC.

That or doing whatever the fuck u/DeepFuckingValue decides to do."

So to update, if you were to set your ""limit order"" price to some crazy high number, theoretically as long as you were within the first however many million shares that corresponded to the 40% over- float, then eventually the shortsellers would get to your shares and be forced to pay that value (say $69,420 per share) because those are the only available shares to cover the borrowed shorts, which means the GME price would then be $69,420

It gets to a point where whatever the buyers and long holders do becomes deterministic to the price. (If everyone sends their limit order at$1000/sh, odds are that is where the max price would be)"

JoshuaTChandler,1611779306.0,If it peaks and then dives down that doesn't mean that it is over. It is over when the driving force (Short Sellers) have abandoned their position. Until then the drops are just people cashing out and probably buying back in to ride the wave.

bamber33,1611779330.0,"Look, to the SEC

This is all public info. A bunch of idiots hopping on a train because a price goes up isn’t illegal the last time I checked. This is a public forum, the hedge funds could have easily cut their shorts but elected not to. It really is starting to come across that you care more about the 1% than the 99. 

If anything, since when do brokerage houses (TD, Schawb) have the right to restrict what their constituents want to do? Last I checked, I don’t think this is legal. Or is it really because they have lost so much money they are trying to limit the losses? 

Leave Reddit alone, y’all got much bigger fish to worry about, and it isn’t the idiots in here who found a way to pay their loans/mortgages by sheer LUCK."

Just bought the DIP AGAIN on NOK - $10K

DON'T SELL YOU IDIOTS - BUY BUY BUY 

Americans please listen, most countries in Europe don't have RobinHood and other platforms to buy GME and AMC but we do have platforms to buy NOK and by the time the stock market opens tommorow in USA, Europe gang can already drive the stock of NOK to the moon 🚀 🚀and then together we can go to Mars!

randomuser00,1611779423.0,I’ve seen more good come from the returns of GME than any hedge would do. People using it to pay for their family emergencies to donations once they hit their goal. Screw the media for turning it into a negative. I’m glad so many people are/have been able to change their family tree with this. The same can’t be said for the greedy hedge funds.

As it’s under $2 now you would buy under the offering price and the stock also has warrants exerciseable at $2.20 so there’s strong incentive to at least reach that price.

Longjumping_College,1611780497.0,"The part that the people paying for bots didn't account for: 

Analytics actually look at this place in their metrics. You just threw them 500000x traffic on tickers and the random ticker jumps are your fault. 

You literally just manipulated the market again and I can't wait till they find out who did it. 

Best of luck!

LISTEN TO ME. DO NOT SELL TODAY. OR ANY DAY THIS WEEK. Drops are coming. They are counting on fear to beat us. It’s the only weapon they have, but it won’t work because we are retarded. The people are finally taking the power back from these boomer hedge fund big money shorting douchebags - the same people who fucked everyone over in 2008 with CDOs and continue to fuck you over to this day.

We only have strength if we stay in this TOGETHER. HOLD THE LINE. THE SHORT SQUEEZE HASNT HAPPENED YET. Don’t pussy out you fucking idiots, we are going BALLS DEEP. The generation that perfected trash talk in COD lobbies takes shit from NOBODY. $10,000 IS NOT A MEME. I love you all you beautiful autistic bulls. Hang tight while we ride this thing into the FUCKING STRATOSPHERE.

deleted,1611780614.0,"Historic moment - We like this stock! We choose to invest in companies we believe in as a value store!

We are at a historic moment in time a paradigm shift in investments.  This is the time when the retailers get to decide the fate of a company.  Previously it was the hedge funds.  Now the wealth gets transferred from Wall Street to the retail we gain more power to decide the fate of a company.

We like this stock!  When you hear that phrase, remember the meaning behind it.  Tesla became a store of value to protect against inflation similar to gold.  Why?  Because we like Elon Musk!  

Who’s to say some greedy Wall Street funds are right in being the demise of a good company and forcing them to bankruptcy?  We like GameStop!  Who’s to say GameStop can’t become a value store similar to Tesla regardless of their business model?

Why can’t we chose any stock to use as a value store?  We can and we will if enough go along with it. 

GameStop is the revolutionary war against the greedy shorts.  This is just the beginning!  This isn’t about making a quick buck and selling, all who hold their funds in the stock create a value store similar to Tesla.  We don’t need the financials or papers or knowledge to create our value store and put our money where we choose!

You’ll have regulators push and say this isn’t right and we’re in the wrong because we like this stock.  The truth is maybe we do like this stock to store our wealth as a value store against inflation! 

The squeeze hasn’t even started it was practically illegal on the market makers to issue more stocks in shorts than existence.  We are not in the wrong, we’re all in the right!  I like this stock will be here to defend companies we like against the shorts!!!

Let the entire market go down except for the stocks we chose as a value store to protect us against inflation caused by the administration’s policies."

It seems people knew that GME had a 140% short on it and which is why they started investing in it. But obviously there are probably momentum investors too. 

Just wanted to figure out how they know GME was at 140% short, so I could try applying that to other stocks"

jessebkrmusic,1611781046.0,I mean to be honest nobody really knows if it will tomorrow or not but it's getting a lot of talk on here which could possibly influx the numbers in your favor. Usually stocks gain or lose value based on the Outlook of the company but in this case it's inflating the numbers by multiple people investing in it for no good reason

I bought 50 AMC at 4.84, it was bearish during the day, then near market close it got back up, so I sold fearing it would go down (after reading news articles that AMC will not last even after the donation). I Mae 10 dollars profit. I woke up to see I could have made 800 dollars profit. It's a very unpleasant feeling, and im taking it as an opportunity for growth, any motivation would be appreciated ."

TinderForWeebs,1611781086.0,"I've been scalping free money from NVDA weekly calls. The IV is reasonable and the stock has price targets ranging from 6-700 with earnings coming up. Everyone knows the earnings will be good but they're not sure if the ARM deal is going to go through. Regardless, it's actually a good stock, and if you're trying for 1 baggers instead of 10 baggers, it's literally free money. 

Gamble at your own risk. But my gains doing weekly options from NVDA is way more than my meme plays."

KingBadford,1611781407.0,Volatility spikes depending on volume and all that.  Basically it's when a lot of big boys make moves while we sit and obsessively watch.  Also earnings reports are released either before open or after close.  After hours can make or break a trader on days like today.  Not there's ever really days like today.

&#x200B;

but seriously, we all have missed opportunities or times we took profits or sold early. Heck, I sold GME and NOK recently being in before much of this craziness. You can't time the market perfectly every time. Learn your lesson, move on, hope to do better in the future. And better to miss profits than lock in big losses -- plenty of people here have had some really bad days. Good luck, protect your downside...obligatory tendies in your future

Okay, I need this to be seen because theyre both concerns I have and would appreciate if someone smarter could provide their insight. I own gamestop shares, love the stock, and want to learn more.

The first thing is that on the Nasdaq site, tutes are showed to own 77 M shares. Outstanding is 70 M and float is even smaller at 59 M (not shown in pic). So can someone explain how this is possible and what it means? What shares are retail investors holding?

[https://imgur.com/v4uUHvY](https://imgur.com/v4uUHvY)

Second, I have one other thing. I heard the SEC is now investigating this sub. What are your thoughts? They can be pressured by Melvin to halt GameStop, and then Melvin can hire lawyers to pressure Gamestop to issue more shares, give up insider shares, etc. That is my main concern at this point; everything is fucking primed for the squeeze but they're coming in just in time to possibly ruin everything. Any insights would be appreciated so much; can't post in the GME chat because no one sees it. Lol. Thanks."

**LARP'd** \- They put out the bait, and you ate it hook, line and sinker.  

You diminished your GME returns position for the dangling carrot known as NOK, AMC, BBY, BB.  

They couldn't beat us, so they tricked you.  Dangled the carrot so you'd sell your shares of GME to them, and you could buy other stocks that they're positioned on so they could rape you.  Regaining their money on other stocks.  YOU FUCKING RETARDS.

LegalizeRanch88,1611787867.0,"Wrong. The market has been trending upward since March 2020 and it was already booming before this GME trend started. Today’s 600-point drop has nothing to do with the pandemic and everything to do with massive amounts of short selling.

Also, you’re naive if you think that Wall Street doesn’t follow WSB and similar social media. They always get their slice of the pie, unfortunately."

# My Idea to Fix the Bot Problem  

Ok retards I just got out of the shower and have an idea on how to fix a piece of the bot problem. I will make it in a simple list so you autist don't have to read much.

1. Make a website ( wallstreetbets.com -dont go here it's all ads) like the [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) in the same format as the subreddit.
2. Have people make accounts on the website that are connected to their Reddit accounts.
3. You can connect the Reddit accounts to the wallstreetbets.com accounts in this way  

   1. You put in your Reddit username to wallstreetbets.com which then gives you a code
   2. You get DMed a request for the code by [u/ultrachadbigdwsbmod](https://www.reddit.com/u/ultrachadbigdwsbmod/)
   3. You put in the code in the website and then your accounts are connected so you can post/comment on the website

""WHY A WEBSITE RETARD??"" u ask,

1. you can filter the fuck out of the bots / post as much as you want as fast as you want
2. You don't have to be afraid of Reddit putting the big fat juicy ban hammer down on [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) when Reddit inevitably gets a big enough bribe from the Hedge Funds losing billions to quarantine [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/).

(The money to host + maintain the website can come from periodic ads and a button that says click this if gay and it shows you a sponsored video) 

ok that was my idea I'm going to go back to lurking now"

McNasty420,1611807770.0,"Can we discuss what happened at the start of trading today?  Robinhood, TD-Ameritrade, E-Trade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, and a few others  all crashed the minute trading started.  Even the apps crashed.  They all eventually came up about 30-40 minutes later (Ameritrade was so slow, I tried moving 20K out of my bank into my TD account and they were putting it in A DOLLAR AT A TIME.  It was like being awake for my own surgery.)  Anyway.  

Um, am I the only one that was kind of terrified by this?  The big firms had no problems trading and seemed to have the entire NYSE all to themselves for a good half hour.  Is this a coincidence?  And if no, WHO THE HELL IS CAPABLE OF SOMETHING LIKE THAT?  I can handle this crazy volatility after market trading shit, but 8 or 9 trading platforms all going down along with their apps at opening bell is scary to me.  Like, Big Brother/Illuminati scary.   

I'm not selling shit, and i dumped the entire 20K into GME when I was able to around 10:30.  But I'm not going to lie.  That made me feel scared.  And now my own platform that has been my lifeblood for the past 10 years, TD Ameritrade is coming out saying they are limiting transactions of GME and AMC tomorrow to ""mitigate risk to their company.""  Dude, you don't think THEY HAVE SECURED A HUGE POSITION FOR THEMSELVES AND ARE SQUEEZING THEIR OWN CLIENTS OUT?  I don't know what the fuck to think anymore after this morning.   I mean, here I am thinking my biggest problem are these hedge funds with no intention of losing money,  when all this time I'm actually being cockblocked by none other than TD BANK!!"

They went offline immediately at opening bell, GME opened at an astonishing 352 where Ameritrade's client portal simultaneously went down for customer trading and the customers couldn't sell at the high opening price, but SOMEBODY was dumping the stock at the high price right away, where it spent the next 45 minutes dropping to it's lowest point of the day 249.  That's when Ameritrade came back online to finally let their clients trade.  Then TD fucking informs us at the end of trading that they will be limiting GME and AMC trading tomorrow to ""mitigate risks to our company.""  Are you fucking kidding me?  Please tell me that Ameritrade/Schwab hasn't secured their own massive positions with GME and AMC and are squeezing their own customers out.  Please tell me the company that has fucked up this stock today is some hedge fund with tricks up their sleeve to gain a 45 minute head start on trading, and not MY OWN FUCKING TRADING PLATFORM where I have been a customer for over a decade.  Because that's EXACTLY what the data is telling me right now.    If this is what is happening, go somewhere else you say.  Guess what. Robinhood, TD-Ameritrade, E-Trade, Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, and a few others all followed the same nearly identical pattern of when they went on and off line.  If the companies that are manipulating the stock price are our own trading platforms who have the ability to prevent us from trading at certain times in certain quantities, it's over.  We physically can't trade GME and AMC if the only place to trade are telling us how much we can buy and sell, with the capability of taking their customers offline.   We have no where else to go.  Game over."

thetost,1611828630.0,"Ok, si I'm holding GME like crazy because I trust you (been a long time lurker here), but there's something about the short squeeze that I don't understand (I'm regarded):

If the short sellers we're squeezing need to buy shares to give back what they borrowed, why aren't they buying the stock that we're buying right now? Are they just waiting for the price to rise up like dummies?

Anyway, thanks for the responses. Regardless, I'm buying some more at market open (from Spain. Here we also like the stock!!)"

Vanilla-Fresh,1611843781.0,"Robinhood has shown their hand.  

They support the suits, not the common man.

They've locked me from buying but not from the sell.

And that's why i'm telling them to go straight to hell.

I'm switching apps to one with a spine.

And next time this happens i'll be just fine.

&#x200B;

Come with me, leave Robinhood, they are crooks aligned with the suits!!!!"

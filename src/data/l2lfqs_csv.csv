realister,1611316879.0,"**Reason why $SPY will always go up**

One of the main requirements to join the S&P 500:

>last reported quarter must be profitable ✅

>aggregate profit generated over the trailing four quarters ✅

Companies are added and delisted a lot more often than you think!

Around 20 loser companies get delisted from S&P per year!

SPY will adjust to whatever happens to the economy, it can't go down by design.

Also nobody cares about the past, AMD market share went from 3% in 2017 to 40% in 2020, so what are you smoking? Their best CPU only barely beat AMD by a few percent in performance, and only in single core. It's like you live in a retarded parallel world."

LaGrangeDeLabrador,1611319425.0,"If any of you guys make some dough and are feeling charitable, don't forget about your local Veterinarian. Many accept donations to help Fur Families in need. 

 Not only that, but 99% of Veterinarians chose their career path because they love animals. And most of them end up euthanizing as many animals as they help 😞.  

It's emotionally draining to wear a Cloak of Death every day and many clients are unappreciative or unfortunately don't understand the costs of running a medical practice.

Anyways, may your tendies be crispy. If your an animal lover like myself, please consider sending some hot tendies(or pizza, or brownies, or a fruit basket) to your local Vet Clinic or Hospital."

Let’s all get this ten bagger and have Melvin and shitron pay for it. More shorts than shares. The institutions won’t even give out more shorts. The shorts are toast they have to cover or get margin called. Don’t waste your time on other things when a ten bagger presents itself.

Pugupine,1611322290.0,"No kidding, it seems like selling CCs on Ford is advanced boomer mode. I guess with the run up this week maye there were IV pumps for $12 and $12.50 that fleeced people on weeklies. If you want to hold stocks and sell CCs it seems like there will always be better stocks to do that with with the same capital. You need massive Ford holding to get more than gas money for the week if you want a safe strike."

I watched a few videos lastnight on 5G stocks. One that I found interesting is PCTI. Leaps are super cheap, too. 

Another that should have a good Monday, is LAC. 

The $22.00 offering expires today. Calls are still dirt cheap in comparison to this last Tuesday. 

For scale, a $30.00 2/19 call cost $299 before the offering announcement. 

You can buy them now for $128. 

I’d throw a few hundo at a $25 call."

Also you can buy far out of the money options and see enormous gains, but that’s a gamble and i wouldn’t recommend it to anyone just starting out.

We were in the low 20c/lb range just a few weeks ago and now I'm getting price increases from everywhere and working to pass those through to my customers. 

So the thought process is calls on miners/mills, puts on consumers like CAT/DEERE who are going to be unable to be profitable with the steel cost hitting the roof. All this is subject to change drastically depending on foreign steel (tariffs) and when more blast furnaces are brought online in Q2 2021.

USD Index: +.13

Crude: -1.4
Vix: +1.87
European Markets: FTSE -.68% DAX -.50% 
Futures: S&P -.62% DJIA -.71% NASDAQ -.59%

Ugly all around. Futures red. VIX and USD bounced off support. Bearish day. Looks like a small pullback after the strong run this week."

I transcribed the image below


""Why does everyone bring up free float like that matters lmao? If NOK hits $10 the amount of outstanding shares will not matter. Stop fear mongering and stomping on shit before it begins. Nokia is the future
I can’t post comments cause my account isn’t thirty days old. And you keep yapping your jaw like you know something. My calls are up and you’re broke and mad. Bozo
All you’re doing is regurgitating garbage takes. Learn to this for yourself. NOK is getting infrastructure contracts from all over the world and has a contract to put the first cellular network on the more. Next warning report it’s going to Mars. No one gives a shot about your fundamentals, boomer. Go buy stock in Apple
*think *moon
Earnings*
Yeah my grammar is fucked but whatever. Imagine calling someone a pussy cause they dmed you. Like I said I’m not allowed to post comments cause this is a new account, and even if I was I wouldn’t wanna expose you as the retard you are for shouting nonsense into the void. Dickhead.
Look at your comment history. Salty as fuck. “Let’s do spy put lottos but fuck the company that is mooning 8% in the last month. Truly autistic and most likely in the red. Neck yourself
Remember when the Steelers were 11-0? 💀💀💀""

In my opinion and that of many leading economists, the jobs lost from raising the minimum wage are minimal and largely insignificant; they usually come from shitty small businesses that are exploitative. The greater economics activity and stability that comes from an increase in wages is far more important and can actually stimulate new business and expansion as there is more cash flow in the market."

Specialized Cooling Systems dealing with military contracts, data warehouses, and massive generators for events (F-1 races/Coachella). Resigning the pact with Russia yesterday is the reason why I think it shot up, and also better news about vaccine.

I’m not a cruise person at all, I like to travel to less traveled places and be uncomfortable seeking adventure. With that said, to my surprise i freakin loved it. Sometimes you just want to lay around and have an open bar and do nothing. Also, girls on there are absolutely wild because their sluttiness “doesn’t count” because they’re not in their hometown or even home country. They’re with a bunch of people who will never see them again and there’s not even internet or social media. I hooked up with a different girl every single night and actually more. I told my buddy about this, he took a cruise a month later and had the same experience. 

What I realized, there are no single dudes wandering around on cruises. It’s only dudes obligated to be there with their wives or girlfriends. But there are plenty of single girls who take the trips together. It’s a target rich environment."

At the same time looking at the events of the last couple of days I feel the big money market veterans are going to be gunning for the retail segment. 

They are going to try and skim the froth and depending on how that plays out and how many autist’s survive the culling will determine the future of retail investing in the USA. The barrier to entry is non existent so it’s just a matter of who survives at this point. My $2."

1. If he didn’t say that, Intel would have fallen faster AH.  It would have meant Intel no longer interested in competing fab biz.  

2. TSM is already making 5nm and risk production 3nm.  By 2023 Intel making 7nm, TSM will probably be producing 3nm for AMD.

3. Fine, Intel doesn’t give any business at all to TSM.  There are plenty more businesses asking for production capacity from TSMC.  

5G, EV, self-driving car sensors, they all use semiconductors.

TL;DL: TSM for long."

Bears will not take this one.  WSB effect incoming."

If it starts the day in the red and there really isn’t news it’ll most likely go up hit a peak and come back down. If it starts green good chance it’s going to plummet a little and make it back,  buy the dip. 11-12 brings sell offs due to the guys who own all the stock taking lunch. Fridays most smart guys know to take their profits so usually a dip, buy some puts sell with meager if any profit and roll that into something else you like.  Don’t be afraid to sell sometimes liquidity is key."

Their biggest market is server CPUs, which is very slow to adapt. AMD's Epyc has been absolutely dunking on Intel, and if they continue the pace, they're on track to really start cutting into Intel's server monopoly.

Yes, Pat coming back is good and yes, they showed that they're not going to roll over anytime soon. No, they did not demonstrate that they're innovating sufficiently to stop losing market share to AMD or combat the rise of ARM (most notably Apple)."

anonymousname133,1611329928.0,"I've been watching the price movement religiously since I got in around 5 a couple weeks ago. Really been impressed by how well the stock has held up through two offerings. Unlike a couple of the emerging medical stocks, BNGO has had big surges followed by mild sell offs. You see a 30% surge and then a 12% cool off. But it always stabilizes after a day. I feel super confident in it.

&#x200B;

Still a bunch of potential catalysts to be had. It's still off the radar outside of retails. Some institutions are just now starting to buy in. Very few price targets as of now. But I'm very confident it'll go well higher from here. 30s in the not too distant future. Just my take. But the more research I did into the company the more confident I personally felt in it. Good luck."

notyetcomitteds2,1611330926.0,"The issue starts with you have energy, that cost money to produce.  You can charge an ev battery or generate hydrogen.   Then when that hydrogen is converted back to water to release energy.....you get inefficiencies.  Already cost more $/ unit energy output for hydrogen compared to ev.  Hydrogen corrodes everything ( upkeep costs) and diffuses through everything.   You lose about 1% volume per day of hydrogen through diffusion.   So thats 1% in the storage...1% in your tank...... 

Ev will always be cheaper, but you have longer charge times and less range.   Batteries need replaced sooner too.   Overall still always cheaper than fuelcell.  There is shit like solid hydrogen which helps with the costs, but refueling becomes a pain, so it defeats the point.   

Government could subsidize hydrogen, but it makes no sense when evs exist....."

This sub is turning into full Stocktwats where I feel like I am in a normie TikTok cesspool and not 4chan x Bloomberg. Inverse WSB doesn’t even exist anymore because if someone gets puts on a popular stock they’re downvoted to shit. For the love of all things autistic mods pls have a fucking paper trading competition. I am fucking sick of hearing the same 3-4 tickers on repeat. I don’t need to see 1000 DDs on a video game company. We get it $BB is cool, you’re so edgy and spamming it every few seconds will totally get it to $15 EOD. The good DD gets buried now in a flurry of 10s of the exact same ticker DD. The good DD in this comment section that used to exist doesn’t anymore or gets buried by “$Ticker🚀🚀” or “$Stock 1,000,000 EOD”. It was funny at first and I loved the rockets but it’s annoying now, .05% isn’t 🚀. I don’t really even post DD anymore because everyone is circle jerking 10 stocks.

Also ICLN is primarily global, it has maybe 3 US stocks and the rest are global, and US companies typically have more growth.

The other commenters made an excellent point that ICLN's volume is substantially greater than ACES so it makes it an arguably more viable purchase, just because it's more liquid."

Pugupine,1611331976.0,"I think Ford hanging on to the 11.40 area is super strong.

Ford is a textbook boomer stock. This two week runup is something this stock just never does. The fact that it ran up as much as it did and a general market down day gives big money a reason to cash out their 25-33% quick flips and they aren't doing so is very telling. A lot of the buyers the last few days aren't selling. Big money doesn't do its business by buying large lots of a stock at $11.90 and then sell the next day for $11.50.

I'm biased of course since I've got calls, but I genuinely think this prie action supports the runup continuing through earnings and I think we see above $12 again early next week."

Senseisntsocommon,1611332331.0,"Depends on the interest rate and how much the balance is relative to your income.  If it’s 0% for x months for an appliance or some shit and you can make the payments with no issues out of base income.  Might be better to keep money invested.

If you are paying actual interest on it, pay that shit off."

The gains of some of his call-outs to short are amazing. It seems like his tweets just cause people to establish short positions, a stock dip, and people buy the fuck out of the dip and squeeze the shorts out of their position. I don't see another explanation for how good the performance is of his 2020 short targets.

BloodMossHunter,1611332378.0,"can i ask you and anyone with a brain something. my friends been working on this startup for like 7 years now. it has some traction.. they got like 2m in funding.. but they havent made money. they got like under 200 users, maybe 300. they make some progress on the policies to make the thing work but honestly its a pretty archaic idea IMO.

&#x200B;

so now their funding is up, they even squeezed the programmer to run up his cc at one point and never paid him back, while themselves taking salaries of 7k a month.

&#x200B;

so they set up this fucking gofundme but for investments, and are pressuring me to buy something , first it was $500, then anything u can to get shares of this pos.  I said i dont really want to, i could throw $100 cause we're friends and they did help me but shit friends help each other so i helped them too. so they ask to share on fb, and again i said no, i aint sharing.

i said - dude i dont want to advertise something that doesnt make money or might fail and he said ""well its a risky investment!"".  I said well make it less risky and he said ""im not even gonna dignify it with a response""

i mean im not an asshole, right? their thing is not gonna work, i dont wanna advertise it to my fb friends. why are they pressuring me w ""you gotta help friends whove helped you?""

I have Feb 19 $60 GME calls, will likely be up 100% or more by EOD. Would it be smartest for me to sell these before close and rebuy next week? I don't usually buy options on this time scale, I'm typically either years or weekly earnings plays. 

Smart brain says that weekend news could bring price down and if I sell today I can lock in gains, then re-evaluate Monday morning and rebuy or whatever. Comes with risk of positive GME news coming out and it gapping up over weekend, but I'd at least lock in profits.

Retard brain is just full of rocket emojis so I dunno which to trust."

If things work out for Ford / rivian we can expect a good electric f150. Something consumers would buy in my opinion. Furthermore their earnings are coming up on February 2nd and they beat them last time. BB won a lawsuit but it still just a security company. It still hasn’t released a solid product in over a decade. It’s just going to become a contractor. Who at best is a low teens stock.

Generally if you buy in one trade you could sell it in 5 throughout the day and that would still be considered one round trip trade. If you buy in 5 and sell in 1, then thats usually also considered 1 round trip. If you buy 2 and then sell 2 then that would be considered 2 different trades. 

I would recommend you reach out to your broker to understand how they treat this. If its a major broker you can probably find with a bit of googling."

Dealers own 30 or 40m shares at this price level I think, so it’s 7/10 or float or something, and 30% od the ‘extended’ float (since long float share minus short shares must be ‘true’ float). You’d need a wave of selling though to activate that cascade."

throwaway__3012,1611335023.0,I know I’m going to get downvoted but I don’t see the play gme can make. I’ve seen some people say they could get acquired but why wouldn’t Microsoft acquire them(if that was their intentions) when they first made the deal with them in October when they were trading at $13 share. Gme can’t really compete with Microsoft or PlayStation for the online marketplace as it is so much easier buying games directly from the respective consoles marketplace. If they solely build computers(switch to a computer store) they are still in the dying retailer space. Other than the short squeeze from hopefully happening I don’t see too many opportunities for GameStop. Let’s see if Ryan Cohen just got lucky with chewy or if he actually knows what he’s doing and if he can turn GameStop around.

 Innovation also progresses for fossil fuels.   I'd wager they could reduce the cost of extracting oil to a point that each gallon of gas you buy would include the cost of a carbon offset and will be cheaper  than an equal energy amount of hydrogen....including upkeep and all of that....way before hydrogen is economically viable for general use.   Ev, im not so sure that claim could be made.

I think it could theoretically outperform once the economy really opens back up because of it's stakes in Heinz and Coke which are heavily beaten down by restaurants being closed. I also like how they have a ton of cash on hand. People keep dumping on Buffett but he is no idiot and I like how he has been delegating some moves to his lieutenants.

Analysis is also cool since you get the excuse of: ""Let me research this a little more"" and your boss will give you an extra 3/4 days.

Take a look at $PLSB it is 0.0001 it's a dead horse, BUT....

Their website was recently updated and looks like it will be a takeover target for a Korean gambling site.

Space_Lord_MF,1611340004.0,"NOK sucks and is a terrible investment.

A lot of the 5g stuff was priced in ages ago and a bunch of other companies are doing it way better. The biggest contracts were given already. 100 contracts last year sounds good on paper but you gotta look into those contracts. Would you rather have the one 5g contract from Verizon in the US that Samsung got (6.65 billion dollars) or ten Scandinavian fishing village contracts?

Nok missed on earnings estimates the last 3 quarters. In fact, their last earnings was basically unforgivable where they decided not to pay their dividends for the quarter.

Nok has a p/e ratio of 26 so its not really super ""undervalued""

Might actually be overvalued.

Has a massive float and a ton of shares outstanding. Nothing will pump this shit.

Look at the 1 year chart. Look at the 5 year chart. The stock has stayed nearly the same in 5 years.

Imagine putting money in a go nowhere stock when literally everything else is mooning?

You look at the people shilling nok, its all they post. The same few people trying to make this a thing wuth misleading DD and crazy speculation that makes stockrwit users look reasonable.

Nokia sucks."

Fizzy_T,1611342271.0,"My attempt to not only shit post today...

Market is down despite better than expected market purchase manager surveys and existing home sales report. Increased concerns over covid infections and poor vaccine distribution has created negative market sentiment. UK may be on lock down til summer, Hong Kong just issued lock down.

Bond prices are slightly up from yesterday.

Reports:

Vaccine distribution: only 800k a day, we were expecting twice that. States are starting to throw away vaccines.

Existing home sales: December report showed 6.76 million homes sold, higher than the expected amount of 6.55. Better than November report as well.

Janet Yellen: received unanimous approval. High hopes.

Markit pmi reports: released survey of purchasing managers. This report came out at 58.0 for January, higher than 55.3 in December. Both manufactoring and servicing sectors showed increased purchase manager activity. A key footnote in here is supply chains bottlenecks have been reported, this could drive up inflation.

Next week reports: Tuesday's consumer confidence index for January, market is predicting 89.1.

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing but this is financial advice you should act on."

I have one question regarding so called attacks from the big institutions. I followed the GME posts today a bit and people were speaking of attacks when it dipped. 

What are they doing during such attacks, selling a massive amount of shares, ordering puts? I know it’s not our way, but while my flacid dong regenerates from watching my wife’s boyfriend, I want to grasp the overall idea a little better."

Just a because some dumbass Hedge Funds overshorted a stock doesn’t mean that retail is taking over.  They took a huge risk and it blew up in there face. Funds did the same shit in 2008. 

Retail is the best thing to happen to the markets and don’t let them try and convince you different. More money and more trading is good for them in every conceivable way.  If they overleverage themselves then that’s thier fault and the deserve to go bust. 

What happened was people found a stock and saw the potential and took advantage.  Just let the MM take advantage of every piece of information usually before retail cuz they can afford Bloomberg terminals or have their  office right on Wall Street and make trades faster than anyone. 

Retail is not going to make any MM leave the market. They make billions of dollars off retail. This guy is talking out of his ass for clicks"

deleted,1611342966.0,If you sell short (sell at x with idea shares will drop and you can buy back cheaper) when the price starts to rise you have to buy your shares back to stop losing money. This causes the stock to rise more and more short sellers to have to buy. A short squeeze pushes a stock to extreme highs like GME.

And unlike almost all other meme crews I've seen go toxic in here since the market crashed, you've been nothing but jovial through every up and down just legitimately having fun with the ride. To me that's the true spirit of WSB, and you all deserve today no matter how much you're in for. If you make life-changing money this week, write a short journal entry about it for you to look back on and relish this victory, because it's a bona fide conquest. I hope it ain't the last.

If I was working on this i'd want to try to determine the 'quality' of the comments on WSB. Maybe an indicator that's the amount of new signups with new comments, out of total comments; maybe weighted by post quality (comment length/sentiment/user prior activity of wsb etc)

With that said, momentum usually lasts 2-3 days, on average. If it was me, I would sell sometime Monday, if not Monday, definitely Tuesday. If you want to be safe, you can set a trailing sell limit order at around 15%."

UnpluggedUnfettered,1611348424.0,"lol ok i am a poor nostradamus but i had a vision

for 3-4 weeks wsb is going to do a real house-cleaning on shorts, a very much needed one.  the sort that eventually makes it not profitable to try to fuck over a stock by releasing shitron level research bs anymore.  weirdly the sort of thing you'd expect the sec to do, but whatever.

companies are going to fucking get \~tictock clap\~ it \~tictock clap\~.  this isn't exactly a private chat.  they'll prep offerings in time with bs shorts and make some cash with offerings that prevent a true squeeze . . . and very slowly all that nonesense balances out and we go back to guh videos here because most stocks are gonna be valued much closer to correctly because yet again the free money button gets nerfed."

Correct as of right now only realized gains are taxed.  Short term is held for less than a year is taxed as normal income.  Long term is taxed significantly lower.  

And it’s total performance for the year.  So if you are up 10k right now and lose 5k from now until end of year you pay taxes on 5k not 10.  

The usual place people get fucked is they have gains in December and losses in January and now they have to pay taxes on money that’s gone."

Senseisntsocommon,1611358558.0,"Very welcome, with income at that level you are looking at 10% tax on your first 10k in gains and 12% from 10k to 55k.  Would guess you probably see a tax return most years right now.  So if you see big gains in a year it would be reasonable to expect your return to disappear that following year.  Rule of thumb for you would probably be to set aside $1200 - $1500 per 10k gains into a savings account.  

You are actually in better place than I was when I turned 30.  Since I had massive student loan debt and wasn’t making that much more than that.  Took me awhile to get my shit together but it at least sounds like you are on the right path."

247drip1,1611368928.0,"I partnered with a us-based company as my manufacturer and they handled all the production and distribution. I designed the product/packaging and they executed when I got sales. It’s literally “dropshipping” but you say that and people automatically assume it’s shitty premade Chinese products (which I strongly recommend against most of the time).

The good news is it was a custom product that was made to order so neither I nor the company I worked with had to worry about a huge amount of storage. 

In terms of testing, I made sure they were able to manufacture to my specs before starting to sell and then would spot check throughout to make sure everything was in line. And this is a very good idea because unless you are working with a massive company with good oversight and quality control, the production guys will cut corners or unknowingly/knowingly fuck shit up on you. I had issues like people not putting my labeling on, not packing the shit correctly so that it would get damaged in transit, not using the marketing materials I specified to include with each order, etc.. lots of little issues to correct over time but nothing terribly catastrophic. This is another reason why it pays to have a US-based manufacturer/distributor, especially one local or within reasonable traveling distance to you. I was able to drop by unannounced a few times and correct issues in person rather than having to hear about them from customers.

And speaking of the customers...the return during covid issue...basically it’s just pretty commonplace now to have a disclaimer “due to the pandemic and increased safety precautions, we are unable to accept returns or exchanges at this time...” People would usually be turned off by that and it would hurt your conversions but now you can get away with it much easier. You don’t necessarily have to do this — a lot of the time you can have a great return policy and nobody will use it. For most it’s just a peace of mind thing to help them make the purchase. But for certain products and certain demographics (I.e. DTC for lower income/status people) having to deal with the moronic return/exchange requests is not worth the time you spend on it. Especially for products with a relatively low price point/margin. I specifically had one product for Uber/Lyft drivers and it was an absolute nightmare dealing with those people. Really gave me a newfound appreciation for B2B business and how clean and professional those transactions typically are. 

The other thing about your return policy is it will come into play with any chargebacks or disputes so make sure whatever you decide on is very clearly advertised on your site/product page. 

Hopefully that gives you some ideas. I could talk ecomm shit for days so if you have any other questions, would be happy to do my best to answer."

blakesidea,1611487561.0,"Hey guys.. absolute retard here.

I may have missed the train of opportunity but fingers crossed I may not be too late. 

I'm about 2 weeks out between transferring accounts and BS.

I will have 22k to drop and go all in. 

PLTR/GME/BB/SPCE? 

WHAT do yall think is a decent option at that point? I guess I'll just all in on PLTR? 

Idc about shorts, I'm in it to HOLD baby."

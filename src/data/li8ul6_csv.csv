RebelliousBreadbox,1613127911.0,"Would you let your kids watch a version of The Big Lebowski where it's all re-shot with talking dogs and uses the original censored version of the audio from the original movie but with some dog related dubbing?

The Dude is now a pug voiced by Jeff Bridges with lines like ""yeah, well that's just, like, your opinion, man.""

The wheelchair Lebowski is now a bulldog with a doggie wheelchair who says ""the pugs lost, Mr. Lebowski. The pugs will always lose!""

His assistant, Brandt, is a golden retriever. 

The Dude's best friend Walter is a dachsund voiced by John Goodman with lines like ""this is what happens when you find a stranger in the alps!""

Donny is a cat voiced by Steve Buscemi. He is out of his element. 

Bunny, the runaway wife, is a poodle.

The Jesus is an Afghan hound.

Malibu's police chihuahua throws a mug at the dude's head.

A human cab driver who is barely willing to tolerate having dogs as passengers in this crazy talking dog filled world he lives in throws a pug out of his car for talking shit about his taste in music. Likewise, the human bowling shoe seller remembers when he sold bowling shoes to humans to wear, not to dogs who just chew on them and still fuck up the hardwood. Adult nerds on the internet can speculate about why this world seems dominated by dogs and humans only appear in service positions. 

Dogs are bad at bowling but still do it and sometimes get really lucky and oddly kinda skilled. This should win the director an Oscar for running a production that involved training dogs to bowl. I'm hoping this will be a good family friendly remake of the Big Lebowski. 

TLDR - just answer first paragraph then.

SnooDoughnuts3377,1613128192.0,"Don't get lost in all the pump & dump FOMO: Weed is a thing for 2021, from a buy and hold perspective. Just listen to Democrats talk about criminal justice reform and not one of them forgetting the weed decriminalization effort. Congress is split, but Republicans from legal-weed states are aware that US public opinion is 70% in favor of decrim.

&#x200B;

My time framework is:

First 100 days of Biden/Kamala - a bill of criminal justice reform being presented (mostly by Kamala initiative), trying to grant access to banking for all the weed stocks in the US and pushing for federal decriminalization (which is harder, and will probably fail);

Until the end of 2021 - bill is passed in a minimalistic framework (so, probably no money to rehab districts that have drug-related issues, but with the federal requalification of control substance status.

&#x200B;

If you ignore the whole Tilray's pump and dump, you see that weed, as a whole, has a huge upside since most of the price movements will happen in the weeks where rumours of this reforms appear."

potatoandbiscuit,1613128566.0,"*The most retarded DD you have ever seen*

Reasons to buy T leaps/shares.

1. Its HBO Max/HBO has gathered 41M subscribers in the US till now. It will go higher. A lot higher(although there's some difficulty in its pricing structure due to its TV ventures, but this problem will eventually be mitigated).
It‚Äôs quality of programs is also subjectively better in my opinion compared to Netflix/Disney's offerings.

If management decides to go bold(which they probably won't), and declares some good shit targets like Disney. You can be ready for an explosive ride.

2. 1M+ fiber optics net addition and this will go much more higher in the future. Fiber optics based internet is the real shit; unless of course you think Elon will eat this lunch.

3. After Covid-19 thingy ends at the end of 2021, it‚Äôs mobile related revenue will increase. Plus, 5g will slightly help(that's what others are saying).

4. It‚Äôs not ATH. Leaps and shares are not really that expensive. One can sell CC, after getting shares, not a terrible investment in any sense. Plus, F are not bad for this company; one could even argue that they are great, though it is not upon oneself to utter the F word.

5. Warner Media related losses will probably decline pretty quickly.

6. Their debt load is declining and would probably decline more in the coming years and quarters. Especially, expensive debt is declining.
One could argue that their debt is unsustainable, but then you would also have to say TSLA's debt load is unsustainable.

Everyone and their mother in the S&P 500 is loaded with debt, and if inflation truly comes after the end of 2021, having more debt is good, not bad.

7. Overall, I would say, in T's case, more doom and gloom is being priced in. Its potential is being mispriced.

8. If ever the management decides to not pay dividend any more, the stock would tumble for a bit and then skyrocket to infinity and beyond.

9. DirecTV will be probably sold. Granted it was a complete waste of time to begin with.

Reasons not to buy leaps/shares.

1. It‚Äôs a dividend paying stock. Which means one can easily calculate the true price of something rather than relying on some fancy FCF predictions which are absolutely retarded.
That means, as long as the company pays this huge amount of dividends, the stock would have to remain connected to reality.

2. 5g investments would make it incur more debt.

3. Management expects only 1% growth in 2021. But again, my common sense tells me, when the time comes for pricing in the growth at the end of 2021, it would probably be already too late to enter. Or maybe, I am retarded.

4. There's no short squeeze opportunity in this stock. Short interest is below 2%.

5. Some of its investments and ventures are now kinda like ICE manufacturers' valuations. People are giving even negative valuations in this sphere. I don't know if it‚Äôs negative or not, but it probably isn‚Äôt much.

*That's all.*

I think, given the bull case and bear case, bull case outweighs the bear cases substantially and the stock has substantial room to run in the future. That's why, I think leaps or shares would be the best to get into this play."

Alexshvd,1613128991.0,"What we know about NOKIA?

It hurts me now to look at NOK. Not because I have 1,100 shares at a higher price. No, I didn't take them on growth. I just think Nokia is one of the most underrated companies on the market.

&#x200B;

Let's just see what we know about Nokia today:

\- Nokia is in second place after Huawei in the field of telecommunications.

\- Nokia will replace Huawei in parts of BT's radio access network after expanding the terms of its contract with the UK phone incumbent.

\- Nokia and Google Cloud have put together a global strategic partnership aimed at supporting telecom providers' compute needs for 5G in both the core and the network edge.

\- Nokia's reporting for 2020 exceeded all expectations!

\- Nokia 3310 is the most indestructible phone in the world.

\- JP Morgan promises its growth.

&#x200B;

Based on all of the above, I can say with confidence - the **NOK = buy**.

No pump, no rockets to the moon, guys. Just a fair investitions. Good luck!"

Last time this amount of preloaded calls were bought on Uranium, it was for CCJ and they jumped from $9.50 to $13 after the group bought all of the $12c.

Big_Stick01,1613133535.0,"Im amazed organigram has stayed close to it's closing price; these dudes have literally been sued for using illegal pesticides in their weed that's harmful to smokers. 

https://ca.topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/personal-injury/organigram-tainted-cannabis-class-action-lawsuit-heads-to-supreme-court/

Literally the same shit that was found in vape carts that undergoes a chemical reaction and turns into Hydrogen Cyanide when heated.

This pesticide has literally killed 12 people stateside when it was in Oil Carts.

https://www.nbcnews.com/health/vaping/tests-show-bootleg-marijuana-vapes-tainted-hydrogen-cyanide-n1059356

if you smoke, and you're in on OGI, get the fuck out. I don't give a shit how bullish they are in discord, OGI is a shit show and can't even post profits to boot. It's literally THE most overvalued one out of the bunch. I sold all my shit except aurora because i feel confident even if i take a loss on it today, it will still get me a gain later."

JhoLow_1MDB,1613133789.0,"If you're playing the chip shortage you gotta have a basic understanding of how chips are made and what each company does. You have chip designers, manufacturers, and suppliers.  The best positioned will be the suppliers and the manufacturers.  TSM is the manufacturer everyone knows, but you gotta understand how a chip is made. TSM still  requires supplies for things like chemicals for vapor deposition and photo resist, machines needed for photolithography, etc. Etc.  Target the companies that make machines for manufacturing and the suppliers of materials that TSM needs.  LRCX, AMAT, KLAC are some examples.

My personal favorite is applied materials, which constantly beats earnings, had a record backlog of orders last quarter, and looks like it'll get even more business with the shortage.  Applied Materials is a key supplier of equipment to TSM. TSM also committed to spending billions of dollars on capital upgrades. Who do you think they'll be buying machines from to address the shortage? Applied materials.  Also, TSM is opening up a new factory in Arizona that'll likely need new capital equipment to get up and running. Applied materials is right next door in CA. 

Finally, did you  see the apple news? Apple id partnering with TSM to make oled displays.  Guess who got into the digital screen market and who has products for manufacturing OLED displays?  Applied materials again.  For a while, the foray into digital screens hasn't been a smashing success for AMAT, which some bears nitpicked on, but it's very possible now that the Apple-TSM deal will rub off on Amat because TSM buys a ton of Amat products.

 Imagine how bullish the upcoming forward guidance may be for AMAT during the next ER. It could be monstrous due to the shortage and if there are some easter eggs in the display division that may be changing course from a laggard to a highly in demand area, the response from the market may be outstanding.  But just based on last ER from AMAT, I'd expect this upcoming ER to be a smashing success. Hell, we may even get lucky with a raised dividend because they have so much cash."

He said, ‚ÄúOh, like you‚Äôre doing now?‚Äù
I was taken aback, and all I could say was ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù but he kept cutting me off and going ‚Äúhuh? huh? huh?‚Äù and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.


The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like ‚ÄúSir, you need to pay for those first.‚Äù At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.


When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually ‚Äúto prevent any electrical infetterence,‚Äù and then turned around and winked at me. I don‚Äôt even think that‚Äôs a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly."

Lots of bullishness behind CVS -- lot of cash so there's upside of them maybe indicating a higher dividend or return of a stock buyback program at some point which would really make the stock soar.

Ran up to $77 last month during the JPM healthcare conference. 2/19 strikes through $75.50 have an implied price below that."

maverick_845,1613137414.0,You can still trade but you cannot make any day trades. You broke the SEC rule that accounts under $25k in value can only make up to 4 day trades per week. To day trade again on Robinhood you must either wait the 90 days or get your account above $25k (where you will then be allowed 3 day trades per day).

JMorg49,1613137632.0,"So now we are just reasoning based on emotions? It doesn‚Äôt matter if you think it‚Äôs true or not, anecdotal evidence (as a methodology) is literally the most flawed. If you follow it up with an actual observational study or something this is slightly better, but still not perfect. You need a variety of methodologies to confirm a theory. And your idea of ‚Äúpsych research is generally flawed and biased‚Äù is also incorrect. 

I have plenty of experience with these dating apps and dating online and my experiences are different from yours so whose experiences are correct? See what I mean? I am just saying that this is more anti-women than anti-toxicity and that you‚Äôre observations can be distorted by your biases (such as confirmation bias, availability heuristic, etc.). 

Perhaps you want to refine what you are arguing. You said women are more ‚Äútoxic‚Äù but do you really mean shallow? Or maybe do you mean that women are manipulative or gold diggers or something? Perhaps that would help me understand this generalization you are making better."

maverick_845,1613137826.0,Correct. A day trade by definition is buying a set amount of a specific security and then selling that exact order in the same day. With the PDT restriction you have to wait at least until the next day to sell. It's not that big of deal. I barely day-trade even though my portfolio is over the $25k minimum (giving me access to day trading). The restriction is sort of a blessing in disguise IMO.

1) don't buy at open if its green. In fact just don't buy at open unless its a sale
2) if its on WSB you're at the 30-60% tipping point. 
3)if its on the news or there are emojis GTFO because it will be -% by EOD
4) previous points are symptoms of FOMO
5) set those stop loss tools and/or alerts. Once it goes off its probably too late
6) if you're feeling dumb but not fucking retard take the profits  keep 30% of those shares in to be a pig.

BobLaChance,1613138296.0,"HUYA v2.0 DD:

1. Yesterday Morgan Stanley and RenTech filed 13-G announcing they now own 30%+ of HUYA (see [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895421/000089542121000175/HuyaInc.txt) for MS and [here](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037389/000103738921000105/0001037389-21-000105.txt) for RenTech). The stock skyrocketed 20%.
2. Tencent already owns 51% of the stock (see article [here](https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/10/tencent-huya-douyu-merger/))
3. Hence approximately 97.5% of total float is owned by institutional that don't actively trade at all. 
4. On the short side, you still have 20% to 30% of the total float sold short (see fintel [here](https://fintel.io/ss/us/huya))
5. Finally fundamentals are excellent. High growth, low EV/Sales vs comps. I'm not even mentioning the potential of livestreaming in China.  

I'm guessing a lot of the shorts are aware of this possible clusterf\*ck and will be exiting their positions over the next couple of days. However, there is still a monumental short-term opportunity as the available float is 1/10 than of the shorts as well as a long one buying a solid stock.

Enjoy !!"

The only difference is that in Communism and Socialism, the poor get poorer and stay there.  Everyone shares the misery with no way of escaping.

At least with Capitalism, the opportunity exists for ppl to pull themselves up out of the muck if they are smart and willing to do the work. 

The media pushes the victim mindset onto everyone so they are trapped and hypnotized by the programming and can't find a way out. It's a mental trap to keep people stuck at the bottom."

That allows them to push down the price while they accumulate. Investing in futures and demanding delivery would destroy the entire financial system. 2/3 of all silver mined every year is used by industries and with the green energy coming, demand for silver will skyrocket.

Uncle_Samoyed,1613138800.0,"The fact that the same analyst gave RMO an underweight rating and QS an overweight rating when QS literally does not have a product or factory yet, will not have a factory until 2024, and won‚Äôt be profitable until 2027...... meanwhile RMO has a product, has a factory, has a partnership already with BorgWarner, has a contract with Lion Electric... I could go on and on. It REEKS of manipulation so the hedges can get in lower before some big news pop. Just reeks of it. I will be buying this dip on RMO.

Can *anyone* explain why an analyst would give an unprofitable company with no product and no factory a good rating while giving an established company with a factory, product, and active contracts a bad one? Besides manipulation?"

jfwelll,1613138801.0,"Well you holding Aurora and Aurora went through illegal growing,  firing up execs, overproducing and losing and selling their old crap, mmm did I mention the moldy episode and quality control problems ? 

Not defending ogi not even invested in it rn but what I mean is that shit hapens and what hapened to Aurora can (and will) hapen to others at some point. Doesnt make it necessarly a bad pick. I lost on Aurora and gained on cannopy but I almost feel i just shouldve invested and not looked until 5-10 years after. 

So many growers, thriving market,  it will go through some better and darker times for many of them. Either its production issues , quality issues, bad management, buying from illegal growers on the side or other shaddy things or just having hard times with regulations... lot of things will hapen in this growth process of a fairly new industry. You can expect these to hapen even more in a bigger market with more players. Maybe exception of overproducing.  I think thats at least the good part of it, many will be able to have a run and from there the strongs will rise and the others may not but  may end up being bought as in the long terms every grower will needed to supply the increasing demand and using installations that are already in place just seems perfect. 

In a long perspective  , since legalization here in Canada 28 months in and the legal vs illegal weed sales are estimated to have become even. With such a high demand there will be a lot of room for growth and many companies , even the ones wholl be going through dark times, can bounce back and become good long term investments.  Thats what Aurora teached me. Was a painful experience going through all this though. 

Im almost thinking of buying, set a reminder and not even look into it for years."

At least they are being straight forward, unlike the guys who don‚Äôt want to date heavier women but sometimes will still give them hope, maybe fuck them once, and then ghost them. I bet all of these guys would love it if these chick would do that to them, but because they don‚Äôt even give them the time of day they get puffy and say they are bitches. How? Maybe shallow, but no more than men (and if guys are just fucking things to fuck then that‚Äôs pretty shallow too). Again, not all guys do this either but men aren‚Äôt just the innocent victims here. 

I am just cautioning you about using your experiences to generalize to all women. I have said repeatedly that this happens and that some women doing this are toxic, but that doesn‚Äôt mean all women are more toxic than men.

DasTooth,1613139679.0,"Why are well written posts about certain stocks getting deleted? I feel whoever is deleting valuable information, is doing just as much harm as what robinhood did, as well as the media, etc. You are blocking solid info from reaching the people that want to read it. For example, I had a friend who just lost out on a weed stock. I forwarded him a write up that just got deleted for him to read and potentially throw 250k at a certain stock.  Now he can‚Äôt read it, and likely won‚Äôt have the same confidence I had after reading said write up."

shockfast,1613140392.0,"For all of you not familiar with trading weed stocks you should know all the crap names like SNDL are gonna drop like crazy! All the OG weed bag holders from the 2017-2018 hype have relived there bags and now many of you have become the new bag holders. That being said, once legalization happens there will be another hype train but that may take a year or 2 so quick trying to pump those stocks. I own many different weed stocks, but I am investing and swing trading for the big payday of legalization. Most of the stocks that are good investments are MSO but they only trade on OTC.

jfwelll,1613140445.0,"It did, when you look at the big picture. But would you have been as confident when they were in the middle of their dark era ?  Its easier to say afterwards. My point here is not to shit too fast on any of them in such a new and growing market. I did it with Aurora and time proved me wrong. Even stocks who have their dark days/weeks/months can make it through the storm. And while in the storm, its harder to see the light. 

Also, im pretty sure growing illegaly is also intentional. Still, they are there.

Cant predict the future, and I dont know much about this pesticides thing in particular. It may be related to trying to save their asses after some bugs problems or you know, having some production issues. It doesnt mean its meant to die and that they cant bounce back. May just be part of the learning process.

My comment was more aiming all weed stocks than only about these two. I just used them as exemples because you mentionned both and I been going through it when Aurora had its loads of problems. Back then I felt it was going down and down and down and I was right , until I ended up being wrong.

And with such a big growth in the next years, you can expect some rollercoasters. 

I just mean to look at them as long , long plays over a few years because meanwhile you can go through all the emotions in the world. I try not let my emotion and dips distract me on how many of these stocks will end up being good investments despite having to go through some shit in the process."

You guys who joined in the last month or so have only had days of chasing other people's trades, and have been left holding the bag. These are the days where you stake your claim. Somewhere out there, there are companies having -5% days with call prices dirt cheap. Some of those companies will double in value over the next few months. Your job today is to get out there and identify those companies. Then you can leave the next generation holding your bags while you cash out your calls 4 months from now and buy a yacht just in time for summer."

d10srespect,1613140915.0,No such thing as a medium term hold these days. Make moves in anticipating a quick flip. Anything you hold for a longer period of time will destroy you in this sort of market imo.

BrandonIT,1613140916.0,"The big players already own their own fabs - they'd need real money to invest in a very expensive (and polluting) fab here on American soil.  That said, this came from \*Intel\* PR back in October 2020:

>""The sole U.S.-based advanced semiconductor manufacturer, Intel is committed to protecting industry leadership and to our continued partnership with the U.S. government. A reliable, secure, domestic source of leading-edge semiconductors remains critical to our country.""

One company tried to build a new fab in America already in the past two years, got almost all the way to the building part, then backed out. ( I need to go look up who it was but they were going to build in the Midwest - it was a smaller player.)

But I think at the time it was a Chinese company 'making nice' with the Trump administration.  I doubt a Biden administration will get the same kind of deal, just my opinion."

ADeepCeruleanBlue,1613141352.0,"If you're going to follow the herd you need to do it early and with gusto, set a profit target, then get out once you hit it.  None of those stocks are good buys but all of them would reward you with big gains if you didn't hesitate and bounced when the bouncing was good.

The correct move for a majority of your portfolio even in WSB is to hold Actual Good Companies You Believe In With Good Fundamentals For A Long Time.

Place your longshot bets, buy your FDs, straddle earnings--whatever, enjoy yourself and maybe make some fast cash.  But do it with a small chunk of your portfolio.  money is hard-won in this world and to make it grow consistently requires more patience than a couple of weeks.

I then get a mysterious email from some dude named Santiago threatening me to leave her alone and I learn she used to be a Colombian pornstar involved with some bad dudes in the drug trade. She comes over starts crying and rubbing my cock which btw is now üíé in dream and real life. She apologizes deeply and says I‚Äôve always known how you felt about me I want to make it up to you. She smiles, stops crying, and starts to unzip my pants and that‚Äôs when..

One thing to hold your positions but wow you all must have cash to throw away.

Guys do research when investing in a stock.

SNDL is garbage company producing garbage weed. Even if congress passes legal weed this company would most likely go under due to competition.

AMC is about where it should be (minus a squeeze? Lol) invest long term is not a bad deal but expect that money to sit for 6-10 months before it hits $7?

Look into companies who are innovative! Virgin space
$SPCE was recently downgraded and dropped 10%. This is a solid company with long term potential and a 10% swing is a good opportunity? 

Look at the news. Rite Aid was a re-emerging pharmacy who just grabbed a piece of the covid vaccine pie, and has an earnings report for fiscal year in april. Price just dropped because of a mis-reported stat in WSJ. 

Buy red sell green my friends. You all buy green and sell red lol. Red is the fire that fuels your rockets."

If you are planning to buy $GME LEAPS use limit orders at around these prices. They're slightly outdated but the ASK is about twice as high as the fair value for these options. I put my limit three cents above the fair price and it got filled after a few minutes because it's also way, way above the bid."

xltaylx,1613142625.0," Okay guys heres my DD on why Bumble is the WOKEST stock and you should invest immediately:

1. Women driven and the CEO is also a woman.
2. Acronyms contain B, L and M. You do the math
3. If Bumble ever were to get Cardi B as a spokesperson for Bumble it's over. Cardi B. B. Bumble. Bumblebee. $$$$$$$$$$$$
4. Online dating during a pandemic.
5. BMBL sounds like Rumble. Michael Buffer approves.

YoloSnek,1613142692.0,"# TDC put in a floor at $47, upside to this week's high of $59.50 and $70+ beyond that

# Original DD [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfulsm/tdc_deeper_dd_as_promised/).

TLDR; Teradata is a data warehousing leader in direct competition with Snowflake. Last week's earnings show TDC's cloud business growing at 165% in 2020; CEO even suggested that they won business back from Snowflake.

We know the legacy business is worth $3 billion. TDC was a $3 billion stock before management broke out the cloud revenues last week.

**Price Targets**

$47 per share or $5.1 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 20x sales)

$66 per share or $7.2 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $4.2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 40x sales)

$76 per share or $8.3 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $5.3 billion (TDC Cloud @ 60x sales)

$105 per share or $11.5 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $8.5 billion (TDC Cloud @ 80x sales)

$125 per share or $13.5 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $10.6 billion (TDC Cloud @ 100x sales)

$190 per share or $21 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $18 billion (TDC Cloud @ 170x sales)

Compare that to other somewhat related cloud stocks: SNOW (170x), MDB (43x), FSLY (50x), DDOG (60x).

If Teradata Cloud successfully catches up to Snowflake, and is valued at the same P/S as Snowflake, it would be an $800 stock."

So while we brought attention to it, I‚Äôm fairly certain some big players jumped in to pump that shit up, not Reddit. 

Legalization is happening, but most of these publicly traded companies you see trending now will probably not fair well when legalization hits. There are state operators that already have their hands in the jar, along with a lot of private funding. When pot becomes legal, I expect these operators to make off like bandits while these publicly traded cannabis stocks take a back seat and most will probably fail due to not being able to handle all of the regulations that will surely follow."

EV tax credit renewal and expansion gets first big push under Biden administration
Tesla and General Motors are no longer eligible for tax credits, but the reintroduction of the GREEN Act would change that.

The House has legislation that would make GM and Tesla very happy.

Back in 2019, Tesla and General Motors approached the cap after selling enough qualifying electric and plug-in hybrid cars that would exclude each automaker from future federal EV tax credits. Despite pushes in Congress to extend them, the measures ultimately failed. However, on Feb. 5, Democrats in the House of Representatives reintroduced the GREEN Act, which among many other tax code revisions would once again open Tesla and GM to federal EV tax credits.

Representative Mike Thompson (D-CA) and Chairman of US House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Select Revenue along with every other Democratic leader on the subcommittee signed onto the bill, hoping Congress will take it up under a Democratic-controlled Senate and the Biden administration. A similar bill was introduced in June of 2020, though it failed. The 2021 iteration of the GREEN Act is largely the same bill, but like its predecessor, it makes some notable changes to the current EV tax credit system.


Foremost, the max amount of money eligible drops by $500. Today, qualifying vehicles are eligible for up to a $7,500 tax credit; the new bill reduces the max amount to $7,000. Just like today's system, the amount follows an electrified vehicle's energy storage capacity. Essentially, the bigger the battery, the more money buyers can claim on their taxes with totally battery-electric cars eligible for the full amount. Plug-in hybrids often qualify for less since the battery only does part of the work powering the vehicle.

Most importantly, the provision includes nixing the 200,000 ceiling on these credits -- the cap Tesla and GM passed in 2019 and early 2020, which triggered a sunset period for the credits. Throughout 2019, Tesla's credits started to reduce, in accordance with the current law, and buyers snapped up all credits by the end of 2019. By March of 2020, GM ran dry, too.

Removing the ceiling would give Tesla and GM fresh ammunition to sell their EVs, and the 2021 GREEN Act would instead cap the credits at 600,000 qualifying vehicles sold. Just as importantly, the federal government would give automakers that already blew past the 200,000 cap a pass on any cars sold in the meantime. In other words, the vehicles Tesla and GM sold between the time their credits ran out and the day President Biden potentially signs the bill don't count toward the 600,000 figure. Instead, they start at 200,000."

SirioBombas,1613144013.0,"Forget the Shorts %, look at those numbers!!

In the post below, it says 1,43MM Etoro customers hold GME Stock, 11% of Customers:

I myself, have 1500, a lot of people have thousands or hundreds of them, more now with Bid price. But let's take lower average of 5shares/pers = 7MM shares on Etoro.(lower average)

Now, we all know that GME was on top list of RH users, but lets take the same % (lower case scenario) of RH users and same amount of shares:

As they Arte the same users number on RH than Etoro (13MM) = extra 7MM shares on RH (lower average)

Now what about Fidelity users:

32MM users so 11%= 3,52MM x 5shares = 17,6 MM shares on Fidelity (lower average)

DEGiro has 600K users:

600K x 11% x 5 = 330K shares Degiro

What about Trade 212 : 13MM users= 7MM shares on T212

‚Äã

ANd I am not counting the whales and those by brokers in direct

so we have here on those most popular APP = 7 + 7 + 17,6 + 0,33 + 7 = 38,93MM retailers Shares

‚Äã

Yes you read that right !!! 39MM shares detained by retailers without counting the others app or direct brokerage or even the whales, and I took a lower average!!

We know that they the Float share is 48,89MM

OK now you see what I see right? Hold your belt !!!

Last data shows 110% of Institutional Share = 110%/48,89 = 53,779MM institut (lower as I think is higher)

38,93MM + 53,78 MM = 92,7MM Shares detained within Institutions and Retailers while only 48MM are available

==============>>>>>>>>>>>> GME is detained at 193% TOTAL !!!!!

‚Äã

Shorts = 73% so 73% of 92,7MM = 67,6 MM Stocks are shorted

67,6MM but 48,89MM is the real Float = 138% real short Number !!!!

‚Äã

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gamestop-amc-reddit-investing-213609595.html

In this article it said 4,5% of Americans detained at today GME Stock , let's take just 2% with only 5 GME share= 2% x 5 x 329MM = 32,9MM detained by Americans and let's say just 20% extra for rest of the world.

32,9 + 20% = 39,5MM shares by retailers remember up when I said 38,9 MM ??? Quite close right??

‚Äã

TNDLR

Retailers hold 39MM Shares = 80%

Institutions hold 113 %

Total= 193 % shares are on the market

SO the real Shorts number is 138%

‚Äã

‚Äã

Alright , I am going to serve myself a Gin Tonic ! do you even realize what s that means? it is even worst for HF that we even dreamt about!!!!!! they will have to buy any fucking shorts available twice!!!! So Guys, no matter the price you will put, they will buy it, they HAVE TO !!! even at 100K/share!!!! Be ¬£Greedy ::

If you see mistakes please correct me....

‚Äã

Alright even if living abroad not financial adviser just sharing my DD so please share for those paper hands scared and let's enjoy the road.... ;)

Cheers!

ADDED AFTER COMMENTS:

1. yes I forgot the world and Revolut and other APP
2. Read that article

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/implied-volatility-surging-gamestop-gme-135301233.html?guccounter=1

Options @ 800 are skyrocketing just today more than 3M shares. for the newbies, means a HH take an insurance buy paying a premium that if a Stock goes up 800 (in this case) they will ""only pay"" 800$, the other company pay the extra. Options are with termination dates. You can check here and click on strike to have the higher amount.

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME

Meaning they are expecting the stock going way up that 800 so they are taking contract to protect their shorts. (so another premium to add on their shorts premium)

Again they expect to go way up 800..... just think about that.....

this_is_my_epiphany,1613144547.0,"> Free Riding
https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freeriding.asp

Example of Freeriding
Say you decide to sell shares of Boston Scientific (BSX) on Monday. You then use the cash from the sale to buy shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) on Tuesday. You sell those JNJ shares on Wednesday, a full day before your sale of BSX shares settles.

Because settlement for the BSX transaction did not occur until Thursday (T+1), there was no cash to cover the purchase of JNJ on Tuesday and the sale of those shares on Wednesday. To avoid freeriding, the investor would have had to wait until settlement‚ÄîThursday‚Äîbefore offloading the JNJ shares.

 Investors who don't fully understand the regulations may inadvertently violate freeriding laws, so it's important to do your research before you begin trading.
As this example illustrates, active traders could easily find themselves in violation of freeriding rules if they do not fully understand cash account trading rules. One of the biggest problems with freeriding is that many investors don't know they're doing it or that the possibility of doing something like this is illegal. For this reason, it is important to become familiar with how freeriding works as well as the SEC rules that prohibit the practice."

Avocadonot,1613144612.0,"Pretty sure it's something like this:

-brokerage let's you instant deposit, meaning you have access to the money immediately even though your actual money hasn't transferred yet

-any purchase you make with this instant deposit is using borrowed money, under good faith that your deposit will settle in a few days

-the next day, you sell the position you bought with the borrowed money

-this means you are getting a ""free ride"" on the money you borrowed, for example you could then cancel your transfer meaning you used margin without putting up your money for collateral

This is pretty important because otherwise you could just instant deposit money you don't actually have, and then use that borrowed money to gamble and potentially lose it all without having the funds to replace"

Wingardienleviosah,1613144711.0,"Yes, serverless simply refers to spot pricing of someone else's servers essentially.  On something like snowflake, you are paying for s3 pass through costs and their marked up EC2 costs. The risk with them is that AWS could put them out of business overnight. I'd also agree with what you mention about programmers not making the decision here, but when the engineers and architects speak on tech solutions the C-suite tends to listen since they generally have no idea what's going on in the space as it evolves very rapidly in my experience. It's 100% possible its a good play short term I just wouldn't want my money wrapped up in TD given my personal experience and the size of the clients we have off-boarded from TD. I have my masters in Data Science and have been a data engineer/architect for 6 years so I feel pretty comfortable with my assessment tbh. In order I would rank the cloud data warehousing software:

1. Snowflake
2. Google Big Query
3. AWS Redshift and Athena
4. Azure Synapse
5. Legacy Oracle + TD offerings

\* Honorable mention to Databricks which hasn't IPO'd and may do a direct listing, but thats not really data warehousing as much as data lake/spark as a service."

JawnxWick,1613144802.0,"I'm sure it will. My simple bull thesis is that its a covid-recovery play. Once entertainment venues are open, along with more indoor seating and post-covid where we don't have to wear masks, online dating (and dating in general) will boom significantly since there is pent up demand to go out and meet people after being in lockdowns/stay at home for months. Since you cant go to clubs to meet girls/dudes most people just use dating apps including but not limited to BMBL to find someone.

Plus expansion globally with their newfound funding and possible future partnerships, sponsorships from celebrities and acquistions, I think its a great hold for the long term."

As a finance guy, I've followed TDC for ~7 years and have never been attracted to the business until I read the results from last week. Their guidance is damn impressive, I'll be watching closely for signs that they continue to win customers back from Snowflake, etc

Wingardienleviosah,1613145475.0,"100%. Really what TD and Oracle sell is not tech, but peace of mind. People want to interact with something simple. Our analysts and data scientists don't give a flying fuck about what's going on on the backend that's 'neat'. They just want to point and click and not have to manage servers or linux instances. I would say snowflake does the best job understanding and giving the best UI experience. In fact, thats the only thing that sets them apart, it's not their tech really. I suppose that makes sense given the founders of Snowflake were long time Oracle engineers. AWS and Azure would do well to understand the power of offering more SaaS point and click managed services."

It has created millions upon millions of shares to stave off bankruptcy and was shorted a tonne because they were poorly ran.  They got a run up for the anti shorters and skyrocketed.  They are not a billiondollar company and if this nonsense wasnt happening they are probably a 10-20 cent a share company.

I consider myself a ""value buyer"" of stock.  I have the best results when I buy companies that have been beaten down.  I'm currently up 87% on GE, of all things.  I'm going to start commenting here about stocks that I like, because... why not?

&#x200B;

Amicus Therapeutics (FOLD) is down 33% today as of about 10:45 AM, and has hit its 26-week low.

The drop appears to be the result of a product candidate phase 3 study that reported difficult-to-understand but positive results.  I believe this stock fell to unreasonably low prices due to a sell-on-news selloff followed by a selling-begets-selling selloff and a stop-loss selloff.  In my opinion it is currently very undervalued.

I had never heard of $FOLD before this morning, but I bought it this morning after some quick research.

Anyone with $FOLD opinions to add?"

Stocks moon and crash overnight as a result of gamma squeezes on options. 

At the same time, every stock dumps after earnings no matter how good/bad because of the same gamma pump into earnings and IV crush post earnings.

Are we not the market makers then? We‚Äôre buying so many options, taking advantage of significant leverage that we are literally moving markets, by forcing hedging on calls."

AMD holding vs INTC at this point is more emotional than rational. Beyond the quality of the product they both produce there are many variables that are underpriced in INTC as a business. Its strategic (even geopolitical advantage) of having its own fabs in a world where East and West is ever more polarized. INTC can improve its products its just a matter of time, in the mean time they racking in free cash flows 2 times bigger than AMDs entire revenues. Its a matter of time before Chipzilla takes its throne back and honestly in this industry it wont take many years before they break the 1 trillion market cap."

If you buy something online, like coffee beans or whatever (from the actual seller, not like on AMZN), sometimes on the bottom of the transaction page you'll see ""powered by Cloudfare""."

No_Ordinary_916,1613146193.0,"No I'm mad because i asked what happened, and you responded with market terminology and looked down on me for it.

As an electrician, I'd never outright berate an apprentice for him asking something, me responding back in terms he doesn't understand. I have no right in getting mad at em' for not know what I was talking about. 

Obviously you're in no obligation to teach. You don't have to repeat that line, but very fucking obviously I knew nothing about what even happened. At best your reply was meant to be smarmy and smug. Not fucking playing that game homie. I don't care if I don't know stocks stocks, and I'm just asking what's going on. Your decision to respond wasn't with any intention other than to feed your fucking ego and get a laugh.  


If I don't know what happened, then why would you expect someone to know what you're talking about. That's fucking inconsiderate and disingenuous. It seems like you're half assedly responding to things with expectancy. You know more often than not, people are new here? So yes, your response is disingenuous because you want everybody to be where you think they should instead of trying to help.

I never said shit wasn't complex, so fucking thanks for fabricating my opinion I guess? I'll take your thoughts of my  thoughts and try to weave it into your assumption. Also, I'm mad at being swindled after being told I was helping people take a stand against something unjust. I'll always stand for the little guy, that's just my way..I understand that I understand less than I should, but my goal was to help people out who again, had a working format and be a helping hand to what was very obviously a movement in the making.


So take it, justify it how you want, you were being a cunt, and you're not gonna walk it back. I understand you."

MeasurementHuge8429,1613147050.0,"Options don't necessarily ""fuck"" the market. You can be bearish and bullish with options, on both sides of the strike.

Gamma squeezes do not necessarily moon/crash stocks. To say it is because of one metric or formula is incorrect.  


Every stock does not dump after earnings. Earnings consist of a CPA's evaluation of a company at a certain time. Conference calls, also have market outlook and more underlying information. Companies can have better than expected earnings, yet have a bleak outlook and decreased sales- which could drive a stock price down.  


MM play in options and not really individual stocks. GME is an example of what happened when stocks did not follow the options. It's a question of what came first, the chicken or the egg."

No matter what. It will be worth more then 30, i think in 5 or 10 years we will be seeing a 200 to 300 dollar stock. This is a global cannabis comapny. And they are one of the bests. Stay strong.

Like Apha and Tilray are merging and look like they will be pretty dominant in Europe which is seriously bullish long term because Apha has great facilities.

Canopy looks to be leading the charge on beverages and has the backing of STZ and while I am pretty meh on the idea of beverages damn near every woman I know loves the fucking idea.  One drink instead of half a bottle of wine or half a dozen beers at an event is pretty appealing.

Cron is damn near a pharma company at this point and could get acquired by MO of legalization does occur.

ACB has made a pretty dramatic turnaround for a company many expected to be out of business right now.

I personally am not rushing to buy Canadian companies right now at these prices but there are a decent number of bull cases to be made."

OgreMagi_is_shit,1613147348.0," Buy Build-a-bear. people were shilling it during GME, but upon looking closer the short interest is literally not even there because the play is actually solid. Build-a-bear has a unique advantage compared to most businesses in that the product it sells markets itself entirely, you go to build-a-bear to build yourself a stuffed animal and tell everyone else you built it and stuffed it yourself, rather then just simply buying a fucking stuffed bear. This gives it a unique position to capitalize on social media that the board just has not done yet, but have come to the realization of in the the nick of time. The brand alone is worth a billion dollars, this is a household name trading at microcap levels due to crystallized and stagnate valuations. This is essentially the greatest retail redemption arc ever told waiting to happen, and with JUST 15 million dollars could buy a controlling stake, including a bunch of autists pressuring the company to make frog plushies. Imagine if the shitty dress up games that 10 year old girls love to play asked them if they wanted to buy that doll in real life after they dressed it up, that is essentially the monetary minting machine waiting to be unearthed by build a bear  


They're turning more money then before covid, management has picked up on it being time to seriously turn the business model around. The brand value is mostly held in the 15-24yo consumer segment group who were children and interacted with the business every time they went to the mall, brand value which can now be tangentially turned around and spread through social media like wildfire by selling either sex or memes. Build-a-bear lets you bust-a-nut on valentines for example, or else switch to selling stuffed frogs and emojis or other random lulz shit and give people weird decoration options. It is a fundamnetally unique buisness model that deserves a unique valuation, the brand recognition on that business alone is insane and it's only 80 mil mcap."

MeasurementHuge8429,1613147578.0,"You make money off volume. More gunpowder makes bigger boom. Generally speaking, 1 lot of stocks = 100 stocks. If you have 1 lot of stocks and it moves $0.05, you are up $5; $0.1 is $10; and so on.

So your $42, you will need to find a stock about $0.42 a share to buy into. So basically you need a penny stock which you could get a weed penny stock like C L S Holdings and maybe get lucky since you are going in on the weed play.

You could buy something more, yet you are sacrificing volume. You could buy 10 shares of NOK right now, and when NOK finally hits %5 again in 5 years. You will have made $8."

andrewpwiener,1613147683.0,"From doing the most I could do by researching the shit out of AMC and BB with technical analysis because lets be honest, I just can't trust you fuckfaces to know what is actually going on. They both seem to have a breakout pattern forming around their MA's.. and maybe need slightly more volume to get those pumps. 

 \- AMC has a ‚Äúwedge breakout‚Äù pattern forming with their respective SMA‚Äôs and MA‚Äôs. Basically, the highs from January are trying to break the lows and then converging to a pump. Think about it like a rollercoaster going up and down its peaks and valleys but continuously goes down, slight peak and down and then is slowing down a valley but getting held back without enough force to get to the next peak (like you trying to finger your girlfriends until she comes but you realize you‚Äôre in her ass instead). The area if people want to buy more in should be around $5 area to get it to pump to at least $20-18/a share. Plus, statewide theater reopening‚Äôs will bring in more revenue for some value in the stock. 

\- BB has something similar going on, with more focus on the breakout coming through the middle of the $15.50 area. The VWAP was high this morning because of news on your mom's car Hyndai and that generated more volume from institutional buyers. But fuck those ‚Äúinstitutional buyers‚Äù and fuck Jim Cramer. BB has legitimate value in terms of going long but if you really focus on the breakout of the MA VWAP cross pattern that‚Äôs forming it could pump to the $32-29 area. You could essentially skim a few shares off the top and keep 50 to 100 for long term profit.

We need more volume buys, can one of you guys troll Chamath into placing enough call orders in to pump the stock up more. There‚Äôs money under the table and on top of the table that could be easily grabbed. 

Also FUCK CNBC and FUCK Jim Cramer"

I confess, it's kinda boring (the asterisk-labelled stocks are those with too low a market cap to be mentioned). As a beginner, I have yet to go all-out YOLO on anything. Today, I'm not going to fuss over this.  Instead, I'm going to do some errands.  Also, I plan this weekend to do some [reading](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/wiki/index) to better familiarize myself with the concepts of stocks.  


Regarding the few GME stocks I've got, since I am going to be away from the computer, I set a limit sale of $100 for them.  I doubt it will reach that today (or ever), but, just in case the price does unexpectedly swing up, I'd want to take advantage of that.  Otherwise, I plan to keep them as a souvenir, since the GameStop saga is what first inspired me to show up here."

Shamizzle,1613148204.0,"lockup can't really be priced in well, imo.  No one knows what the current shareholders are going to do once they're unrestricted to take profits.  Sure they will, but the price on PLTR was juiced from demo day and all the big contract announcements. It's barely gotten time to cool off, and a big earnings beat could muffle the potential loss from lockup.

Right now, it's very much up in the air as to what will happen.  I'm not big on playing through this uncertainty, but there IS money to be made on theta and IV so I'll hold my shares and sell covered.

I'm longterm bullish, so if there is a big selloff, i'm buying heavy on the dip.  I doubt i'm the only one, so volatility will probably be pretty jacked next week and the following."

brad4498,1613148688.0,"Someone tell me what I‚Äôm missing with this play or why it‚Äôs a bad idea. 

So let‚Äôs say I buy a deep ITM spy 2023 leap. Say $200. With spy at $390 it costs about 19k.

Say I also buy an ATM SPY $390 put leap for 2022. Say it costs 3.5k. 

Between 200 and 390 my net loss exposure is 3.5k. Below 200 and above 425 is profit. 

So net risk is 3.5k and net investment is 22.5k. Upside is unlimited. 

Comparatively if I buy 100 SPY at $390. My risk of loss is unlimited to the downside. And my upside gain potential is like $1000-$2000 more if I hold the stock versus the option with the put hedge. While also requiring a $39k capital outlay. 

What am I missing? Seems a great play. If the market keeps mooning I‚Äôm winning big. If it falls or stagnates, I‚Äôm out 3k only. Unless it really tanks, in which case my put would become profitable enough to still result in net gains."

ie, everyone has always played the earnings run up. Speculating on it. But now instead of buying shares, we are buying options. En masse. 

Which then requires hedging. And through our use of leverage, on top of the rest of the earnings momentum speculation, you see price rise into earnings, after which IV crush hits options and people either take gains or losses and close their options. Which then reduces the hedge risk for the call seller, right?  

Which is why we see the pronounced exit after earnings. Basically it‚Äôs the same market mechanics as always, but amplified by the options flow and leverage at work."

As for GPS, If you look back at GME and other pumps you'll find that there was a lot of unusual volume a few days/weeks (depending) before the pump run up. Figured I'd let you know that **if** GPS is on that track, today looks similar to those opportunistic buy ins prior to highs."

MrBdstn,1613149229.0,"TWITTER tells me URANIUM is going to be ""trendy"" soon.  

A quick guide:   

\- Nuclear is the cleanest source of energy after Wind / Hydro.   

\- Nuclear has the best space-to-generation efficiency compared to the cleanest sources (wind / hydro / solar).   

\- Nuclear power is safe, the only  thing that still needs some work is the waste disposal, but while we learn how to dispose of it safely we at least know how to safely store the waste.  

\- With the ""green revolution"" coming this year, we need a short-term solution to phase-out coal / oil. While eventually it will all be overtaken by solar / wind / hydro, the ""fastest"" way to phase out the old ones is to go Nuclear, Nuclear can produce enough power to sustain us while we build the necessary infrastructure for renewables.   

\- URANIUM MINING companies and URANIUM ETFS will xplode this year.  

\- GO LONG!"

Shamizzle,1613149231.0,"No way.  High IV is the ideal market environment to sell shorts to gamblers.  Jacked prices on premium on \~ 30DTE is my play around most scheduled events. Even if there's a big swing and it puts my contracts ITM, the likelihood of them reverting gets higher the longer I wait.  Then the event crushes preems and even an ITM contract is a loser for the holder.

It's the theta gang way, but I only do it around high volatility stocks that I hold long. I use the jacked up premium I took to load up on more of the stock.

I'm not expecting to go from low IV to high IV over the course of my contracts. I'm expecting to sell high IV that crushes after earnings."

Last generations investors have been burned and bored by the companies lack of turning this intangible MONOLITH of a brand into monetary gains, and have become jaded by it, overselling and undervaluing the company because it. Overselling it to such a degree that you can now buy the brand SEARED into every single childs brain in every small across america, for 80 MILLION DOLLARS.

 

First, some juicy numbers:

 üÖ±Ô∏è  üÖ±Ô∏è W corp has nearly 450+ stores operating internationally and domestically, in high traffic areas. With stores in most major malls across America, brand recognition for Build-a-bear marketing and products is inconsistent with the valuation.

From November 2nd 2019, to October 31st 2020, BBW had a comprehensive quarterly income increase of nearly 7 million dollars. Quarterly income for 2019 was plagued by low sales both online and instore mall locations. You would expect this trend to lead the companies demise after total mall retailer meltdowns from Covid, but with the companies 100%+ growth in ecommerce over the past year, as well as the closure of many liability locations, the company is actually far more profitable then before!

The companies liabilities have only increased a marginal 80%, largely from mall leases, which is nothing compared to the growth.

# What does the future of this company look like? üåï  üåï 

How about ""Build-a-meme"" or ""build-a-emoji""  
All it takes a slight shift, and the social media machine will PUMP this company to the moon. Take the timeless, cutesy, girly brand of Build-a-bear, and tweak it ever so slightly so that everyone across america wants to go out and build a fucking bear. Just imagine the front page of reddit, ""LOOK WHAT BUILD-A-BEAR"" LET ME BUILD FOR MY GIRLFRIEND"" with a stuffed heart or rocket emoji, with little stitching saying ""luv u bby""

Suddenly the masses want to build a fucking bear, they know where it's at, they know the website, they know the process, they know their girlfriend loves stuffed animals. Just a little push, all the brand needs"

SportTheFoole,1613149634.0,"I‚Äôm not sure, but I think it could be either in open or behind closed doors and that it could be televised or not. Some testimony is definitely behind closed doors and not televised (e.g., national security issues). For this, is more or less expect that it would happen in the open because there‚Äôs nothing a congress-critter loves more than grilling these guys with a sound bite for the media to play to the constituents back home. 

That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt expect much. These guys will have prepped for this and are almost certainly smart enough not to say anything that could expose them. DFV, however, might be a wild card. I hope he‚Äôs lawyered up."

USFederalReserve,1613149719.0,"Last I'll post about it, not trying to spam. Full disclosure I've already entered GPS at 22.9. 

I went through to last 3 weeks of option flows for GPS. 

Every single day, there was no more than 2-3 call orders, all for less than 50k each, small volume, low attention. 

Which really calls into question: Why was there almost 3mm dumped into calls into GPS in the last 30 minutes? 

And why did GPS have a huge increase in volume today that is far out of the average daily volume? And why did GPS do this at the exact same time as yesterday? 

Look at GME before the run up, before the meme. Look at the strange price action on it - there's similarities. 

Now I'm not gonna say this is gonna moon like GME, but I will say that the GME thing was engineered by bigger pockets than hours, and the first step is getting in before anyone else hears about it. 

Their only mistake was that they thought no one was paying attention. Good news for you, the US Federal Reserve was paying attention, baby. 

It's currently hitting 0% for the day after being around 1% down 30 minutes ago. The IV is still extremely cheap and the twitter furu's that follow the option chain are just now starting to tweet about it.

This could be a runner - if I'm right and you follow this with me, then congrats! 

Use your best judgement."

MeasurementHuge8429,1613150057.0,"You are correct, usually by the time earnings come around, the good news is already priced in.

You have to remember that most metrics are dependent on independent variables. For example, the greeks and IV are not independent.

You are also assuming that everyone has the same rules as when to sell/buy. Some people will look to simply take the premium, some will look to buy/sell at a discount. For example, I am happy with taking 30% profit in general. I recently sold 1 cover called on IBM Mar 26 for $2.053. I did a straight single option trade. It currently last traded at $1.61. In two days, I could buy the call and make about $50 profit. Granted the IV is only ~30%. 

On the flip side, I had bought BRKS at $80.57, and it is trading at $91.47 right now. I had also sold CC Mar 19 85 Cover Calls at 3.343. It last traded for $6.91  with bid 8.70/ask9.90. They had earnings the other day and have simply gone up since then. Anyhow, I am fine with letting it get called at $85 where I got my premium and the profit.

It's difficult to objectively quantify ""sentiment"". So BRKS is an example that stocks can go up after earnings."

ignatious__reilly,1613150164.0,Easily. This is my huge play in my portfolio. I‚Äôve done so much DD and once the revenue starts popping this thing will be unstoppable. I realize how hard it is to hold a stock that can bleed for days at a time. The real good ones do that. But 7 years building a new platform for the company and the day is almost here for a rocket launch. The chart looks sexy as hell. We will dip some more but sooner than later we are headed to $30. Collect a base and then fucking off and holding hands with Amazon all the way to the moon. Triple digits will happen with time. I have no doubts. This is the real deal.

brad4498,1613150239.0,"No I‚Äôm saying only 2k in reduced gains. Whether spy hits $450 or $750, holding shares vs holding the leap call/put spread. To the upside the gain is reduced by the 3.5k put premium. Unless you hold til expiration there is some small time premium so the difference before expiration is like 2k instead of the full 3.5. At expiration the price difference in gains is the cost of the hedge versus holding the shares outright with no hedge. 

Where with shares you also get dividends. You‚Äôd also realize slightly higher gains on the upside because you don‚Äôt have the put premium. 

The only reason for buying the put is to limit the downside risk of the deep ITM call, and to limit the ultimate capital at risk of 3.5k."

Chip shortage + slew of new EV models needing NAND / IT solutions = perfect storm for rapid organic growth."
mikesmcd,1613150604.0,"I mean, I can give you a couple right now:

The execs have super low stakes in the company right now, 1.63%. This means when they've issued more shares, they did not retain much or any and did not pick up more as time went on. This is a solid signal that leadership is not fully confident in their own company.

SNDL performance as a whole is absolutely trash. Low earnings with little to no ambition to expand or correct inefficiencies that could help the company grow.

Lastly, their enterprise value is negative to their EBITDA. Even before paying off the expenses required to operate the business, they are valued far less than what they can afford to repay. Obviously, this is super bad because it could signal potential bankruptcy.

Overall, SNDL will not be a market mover for weed. I agree with the sentiment that weed stocks will be winning this year and the next couple of years, but I do not think SNDL will be a part of that growth stock group.

Edit: This is just my face value analysis of the company. I could do more technicals and would not be surprised to find more holes in the company."

If you can see large numbers of outstanding calls either at or very near the money, about 2 weeks before earnings, you can assume they‚Äôll all move ITM.

Buy a deep ITM leap, but an ATM put, create a downside limit risk, with upside unlimited 

And it requires less capital outlay than if you bought the shares outright, at the cost of dividends. Small gains to the upside have to overcome the put premium, but otherwise upside is unlimited if it really takes off. 

Seems this would be a great play for something volatile with growth potential."

Ultimately, the people with the actual shares are ultimately the decision holders if they want to sell or not. An option is only a contract that at some point, needs some sort of actual stock tied to it. People could technically say I don't want to sell my stock and naked options traders would be screwed."

brad4498,1613152233.0,"Presumably most of these are naked options, which are hedged up/down by MM based on the price/probability exposure. 

So a bunch of calls raises their exposure. And they buy to hedge those calls. Which in turn, running into earnings will attract additional speculation and share buying, on top of the options. 

So it creates the gamma squeeze as these calls all move closer to the money and have to have hedge buying to cover.  It becomes a feedback loop, which then immediately crashes as the calls are closed, thereby allowing them to dump their hedge since they no longer have to deliver those shares."

I'm SUPER new to investing, and I'm trying to do my own DD, but a lot of this is greek to me. Is anyone willing to point in the direction of good sources to help me figure out what to even look at for short term plays?

WheresHarveyDent,1613152539.0,"Since I've been monitoring my shares of it like a hawk, I'm seeing some patterns.

1. This stock was on pace for $50 a share before the pump and dump bump and has settled safely at that range.

2. Hedgies are selling the stock in the mornings and dropping it down to around $48 a share. Once here, retards on this sub want to ""buy the dip"" and raise the price up. They declare, ""the second squeeze is happening"" and drive the stock up to around $55-60 again. Those who are smart sell here. Stock settles in around $50. Afterhours trading happens and the stock either starts low the next day and skyrockets in the morning or starts high and plummets.

Retards are making this an easy stock to day trade with. Try it. You'll see. It's already down $3 since I sold it. Im buying again at $48 which I promise it will dip back down into today. Sell again tomorrow around same peak. Rinse and repeat"

they have a decent logo too i bet if they put more money into marketing merch they could make a killing there too, definitely keeping an eye on that for the future

RISC-based chips are the future, something Intel has no experience in....I expect AMD to be able to adapt to the RISC-market much easier than intel. But NVDA will be the clear leader with their acquisition or ARM. IMO Intel with their dividend is a value trap, they need to be aggressively investing in their future, but I guess time will tell"

When you buy, they do some immediate hedging with your premium. Then based on the Greeks they add/sell shares to hedge as the price moves or stagnates and time decays. Etc. but if it moons, they have to cover to minimize risk on the $20 calls, which then pushes the $22 ITM so they have to hedge again on those etc. 

It absolutely explains GME taking off. And it explains TLRY soaring and dumping. People bought shares too yes. But they bought a fuckton of options that were gamma squeezed, then the option holder sold the contract for profit, allowing the original naked call seller, to unwind their hedge on that call since they no longer have an obligation to deliver if the option is closed."

Alolanvulpixie,1613153931.0,"No one is quite sure what the exact catalyst was, but certainly a big part of it was Logan Paul very publicly getting into collecting and buying some hella valuable cards. From there lots of youtubers and twitch streamers starting opening packs on camera, and the sets that have come out in the last quarter had Charizards and Pikachus (which are ALWAYS collector cards. A few years ago I bought a few packs to open at my game shop to burn time before the tournament started. Ended up pulling that set's Rainbow Zard and sold it for $350 cash within minutes to one of the collectors at the store). So not unlike GME, everyone and their mother decided to start buying everything and anything they can get their hands on, without knowing what is and isn't actually desirable for collectors or competitive players. And now its a self feeding cycle of people buying whatever they can get their hands one, because someone else will buy it from them because they can't get anything at retail, hoping to either re-sell even higher, or to open the packs and pull the money cards.
It managed to get a set (Evolutions) that was released in 2016, and was universally hated in the Pokemon community (when they'd announce new promo box sets that would come with like 8-10 packs a lot of us would bet on how many of those packs would be Evolutions because it was clear they were trying to get rid of their supply). The MSRP for a Booster Box is around $150 (although most local game stores sell them in the $100-120 range). That freaking set is going for $1k on EBay. 

As far as stock plays. Cards are through The Pokemon Company, which is owned by Nintendo. I know cards make up a huge portion of The Pokemon Company's revenue, but I don't know how that equates over to Nintendo.
But I do know my Nintendo sock has been up this week, not significantly, but about 5% since I bought it (which was a little over a week ago). I personally like holding Nintendo. But it is definitely more long term (although I can't help but wonder if part of the current rise is because the US card frenzy is catching the eyes of media now). The Switch has been out since 2017, so we are probably due for rumors and/or an announcement about a new console in the near future, not to mention 2 of Nintendo's biggest franchises (Pokemon and Legend of Zelda) both celebrate milestone anniversaries (Pokemon is 25 this year and Zelda is 35).
But that's just my thoughts as a Pokemon fanatic."

JLGT86,1613154106.0,"Quick, nobody tell em

Since you are not asking ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs an FD?‚Äù, I guess you deserve some explanation. Yea you mostly got the basics. To your first question, when you buy options (call or put), you are not obligated to do anything, it‚Äôs your choice to exercise it or not. So your total potential loss would just be up to what you paid for it. And yea, call is the rights to buy shares at strike price and put is the rights to sell shares at strike price.

Edit: note, this only applies to when you BUY an option, if you write/ sell options, there IS an obligation that could cost you an arm and a leg. Because you are guaranteeing someone the right to buy/sell shares at strike price from you. So if you don‚Äôt know what you are doing, don‚Äôt write/sell  options. 

In case you ever wonder ‚Äúwhat happens if I bought a call option and the share price is above strike price, I want to profit from it but my account isn‚Äôt big enough to buy 100 shares of XYZ?‚Äù, most ppl would just sell the option back to the market. Someone on the other end would buy this option back with the difference/ profit you are entitled to, to eat their losses."

I know older unopened MTG box sets have absurd value due to the lotto ticket nature of chasing huge collector items as well. Better to sell someone the possibility of hugely valuable items rather than the item itself in some cases at least. i was just looking at nintendo's ticker, its up a good bit on the month but I doubt it has much to do specifically with the card craze, but an upcoming next gen console announcement and anniversaries of their most prized IP sounds interesting enough to hop on some 30-40 DTE calls on the next red day.

NotMyChairr,1613154608.0,"I have a theory about WSB and the recent explosion in activity

It is a simple theory really.

1) The word ‚Äúretard‚Äù has been in this ambiguous state for a long time, with only a few daring lunatics (and edgy 12 year olds on XBOX) willing to use it in any public forum. Back in the 90s, it was a much more controversial term and was at the forefront of many social justice censorship movement. More recently, the SJWs have moved on to censoring much more impactful and offensive words, like ‚Äúbreast milk‚Äù, and ‚Äúlady boy‚Äù. In this natural evolution of the naturally offended, the word retard has been left behind like a sad puppy on the side of the road whose owner lost all their money gambling on the internet. 

2) At the same time, the word ‚Äúretard‚Äù is such a powerful and satisfying derogatory term. I‚Äôm not sure if it is the way it rolls off the tongue, or the mental image it now produces of a drooling, bumbling millennial watching his wife‚Äôs boyfriend getting pegged by a hedge fund manager while frantically buying penny stocks on Robinhood. Or perhaps it is the context in which it used on WSB, self-deprecating and full of allusions to uncontrollable autism and wild impulsivity. All in all, the word really just *slaps*

3) The ‚Äúanonymity‚Äù of Reddit creates an environment of relative impunity when using this word, the crowning glory of the bad words you got in trouble for saying to your mom after she caught you with 16TB of porn and took away your Nintendo 64 for 6 hours. 

When you really step back and evaluate points 1-3, you will see, as I have seen, that the rise in popularity is not tied to any stock, but rather is tied to the glowing freedom experienced by shouting about retards from the proverbial rooftops of Reddit. 

*disclaimer - I am a financial advisor and this is absolutely financial advice. Buy $RTRD*"

Moooooonsuun,1613155131.0,"If you think retard was more controversial at any time before 2010 you've gotta be crazy.
 
Almost *everyone* said retard up until we had to start pretending that the *entire* time, it was said as a dig against the handicapped instead of as a dig against someone who *isn't*. The Gen X parents, who helicopter-parent their kids enough as it is, are even worse with their kids if they're disabled.
 
Out of fucking *nowhere* we went from ""say retard all ya want"" to ""I have a cousin who was raped by a man with downs syndrome. You should say that."" People won't even say *the word as a reference* in a discussion anymore. It's ""the R word"" now.
 
Lately I've noticed that a lot of people are wisening up to how stupid the outrage over it is. Louis CK has a great bit talking about the word where he argues that no one really saw a retarded person and made fun of them for being retarded, and that instead people were calling non-retarded people ""retards"" because they were acting as though they were mentally retarded.
 
It's not ""wow you legitimately are special needs you fucking retard"" but instead ""you are not retarded, so acting like one is unjustified.""
 
Kid with downs gives the mailman a hug from behind without notice? It's funny and awkward and cute.

It has a 23% market share of 2.0 vapes, products, and edibles.

It‚Äôs currently trading over 80% below its value. 

It has a projected growth of over 65% 

It‚Äôs backed by imperials brands and received a CA$ 123M investment 

It has a consensus rating BUY 

They have 3.6% of the overall Canadian market 

Tons of long term potential. 

Tickers: OTCQX=CBWTF    TSXV=XLY

tl;dr Auxly could really take off."

If you are a normal person, not here to yeet money into the dark, listen up.

SPCE went up 11% yesterday due to a flight schedule being confirmed

Flight schedule was delayed today, stock plummeted 11%

WITHOUT A SCHEDULED FLIGHT, it has risen back up to 56$. This is because for SPCE,  56 is around the floor right now for buys, where there is a sell limit ceiling at 60$.

There is a good chance they fly the plane sunday. They have already cleared airspace for both days. Maybe they wait till mid week. Maybe you miss buying SPCE while it is at the 56-54$ floor, and you watch as it raises to 100 on a successful launch. THE FLIGHT WOULDNT HAVE BEEN DELAYED, NOR WOULD IT BE A MANNED FLIGHT, IF THEY WEREN'T POSITIVE IT WOULD GO WELL. 

Decembers flight DID NOT EXPLODE. It failed to communicate to ground, and SUCCESSFULLY LANDED BACK AT BASE. This bird will fly, and Branson is a fucking genius that doesn't play memelord like Elon does. Stop listening to the pack of money losing dimwit cunts and start doing research on real future stocks. SPCE will be a 1000-3000$ stock 20-30 years from now. Calls @ 56 for june are GOOD PLAYS RIGHT NOW FOR QUICK MONEY. This is a LONG TERM STOCK that you can ALSO daytrade at profit every day. Buy now before you FOMO. This is not financial advice, I am just a humble Ape who likes to help people. If you had listened to me yesterday at 10 AM and sold at 4 PM you would have made 11% profit."

LaPulgaAtomica87,1613155965.0,"\*\*PSA for QQQJ\*\*

I know a lot of you have got burned chasing meme stocks (GME, PLTR, AMC and weed) and you're looking for something ""safer"" to play now. Well, look no further than call options on QQQJ. It is attractive because:

1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in big Tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.

2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside in QQQJ than QQQ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.

3) For options (the reason why 99% of you are reading this anyway), IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF that has gone up 30% since November with IV in the 25-30% region. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. ARKK, ICLN, MJ etc have all gone up higher but check their IV and premiums.

4) My favorite reason for being in QQQJ: it is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too much and on hulk-dick green days, it doesn't rocket like ARKK. It just reliably goes up gradually.  


I predicted in December than QQQJ will hit $35 by March and bought a lot of June $35c options. My thesis was that once the constituent companies in the ET reported good, in some cases blowout earnings and provide optimistic guidance for the upcoming year (due to the vaccine ramp up and an actual competent administration), it should rocket up. However, looking at its current trajectory, it will hit $35 and surpass it by next week!!

Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. Have a nice day and make lots of tendies, brothers and sisters!  


My recommendation: Get options expiring in June and September with strike price between $35 and $40. Park your money there, delete Robinhood and check back in 3 months."

Alolanvulpixie,1613155978.0,"Yeah, its a bit of both. Singles are also up, especially graded singles. The craze is so wide spread that McDonalds has to limit the number of Happy Meals bought in a single purchase, as well as limiting toys bought without the Happy Meal because scalpers are trying to come in and buy full cases of the toys (which are Pokemon Cards with special 25th anniversary stamps on them)
But there is also the speculation side of things, with people buying and keeping sealed product. What is interesting is that so many content creators are opening old sealed product (like Base Set boxes) for the hype and the chase cards, meaning there is less of the out of print sets remaining unsealed, so that is skyrocketing the price of sealed product even more."

The only people who say it‚Äôs about sticking it to the man are people who bought in and wanted to justify their losses. Or to convince others that it‚Äôs a team game.

That means the Founders can sell their shares without losing any voting power, and they can issue brand new shares as much as they want and Thiel, Cohen and Karp will always maintain full control. 

> Accordingly, our Founders will be able to achieve substantial liquidity in their holdings without diminishing their voting control.

They just crafted a way to get listed on the stock exchange while remaining privately controlled. What was the point of the DPO then? Just make employees happy?

plasticblock4dayz,1613156954.0,"If you want to keep trading:

Save back up. Don‚Äôt chase your losses. The market will still be there by the time you have enough. On big win or loss days, take a break. If it‚Äôs a loss, assess what you did wrong and what should be done differently next time. If it‚Äôs a big win, decide what you will do to keep those gains.

Don‚Äôt trade OTM ultra short expiry. Play at least 1+ months out, preferably 3+ months out. If you want to play short expiry, OTM even, keep the trading limited based on account size.

Don‚Äôt put it all on one option play. Don‚Äôt play earnings unless you did research prior. Definitely don‚Äôt go all in on earnings. 

Buy stocks in addition to buying options. Use the leverage from options to enhance equity returns. I prefer to use gains from options to buy more stocks so gains are mostly locked in."

They are building a new plant down the road from Tesla. They recycle electric vehicle batteries in an environmentally safe manner, which is going to boom over the next few years and the new plant will be the biggest in the US.

It can reduce your cost basis but also limits your gains if you're hoping the stock skyrockets"

bogeydays,1613157311.0," 

Here's a dumb options question - let's assume I own a deep ITM call that is close to the expiration and I want to sell to close. Will there always be a buyer? Let's also assume volume isn't an issue. Here's an example.

I paid $2k for a call that is now worth $20k because the underlying stock went from $100 to $200. The call is expiring tomorrow and I want to sell to close. Why would someone buy that from me?

If I sell to close I would net $18k profit and if I exercised it and sold the stock I would net $10k (100 shares \* $200 price at sale less 100 shares \* $100 strike to exercise it). Why would anyone buy my option for $20k two days before it expired?

If they bought it for $20k from me and the price doesn't move before expiration so they exercised they would net -$10k ($20k option cost less $10k net proceeds from exercising and selling the stock).

Maybe the figures I used make this an unrealistic example and it wouldn't work out this way? I.e., if the stock went up 100% from $100 to $200 the value of the option wouldn't go as high as $20k so my example is dumb?"

Fucking boomers of the other sub always trying to time the market and constant ‚Äúbubble‚Äù whispers. Fucking pussies. It doesn‚Äôt make you a genius if you keep calling for a crash and it eventually appears 2-3 years or even 10 years later.

These idiots think that sitting on inflationary shitfedcoin makes them a genius when even an index fund is ripping 18-20%. Yes it will crash eventually, I don‚Äôt know when and I don‚Äôt know how much. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be 0 no matter what pos index fund or company I invest in. Yes there is risk if you are leveraged otherwise not.

If you had listened to these idiots in march 2020, you would have missed the greatest bull stretch in last 10 years. There is argument to be made that equities were suppressed hard from 2013-17 but again that‚Äôs hindsight. If you had just stayed invested since March 2020, you are more than covered for the big crash coming whenever.

Anyone with half a nut for a brain knows that fed is printing money like crazy and there‚Äôs literally nowhere else for that money to go. Is it sustainable no fuck no! But what‚Äôs the point of fear-mongering? To make yourself feel better. Suck a d*

It actually happened with GME. People didn‚Äôt have the capital to exercise and people didn‚Äôt want to buy a $300 call knowing price would fall back down. So they had to sell significantly below fair value. So it can happen. But assuming there‚Äôs no bubble with the stock, you shouldn‚Äôt have an issue selling the call."

Your example is really too wild to really make a case for a buyer for it. 100% value increases are fucking nutty and uncommon (at least historically), but it also depends on the time it took to realize that gain, 1yr or 1 day? 

Your options contract too would unlikely be worth 10k more than the underlying security it represents. If it did, its because the stock is so wildly volatile that the greeks demand it to be so. I have no idea what situation would lead to that kind of pricing. 

Read a book called Options Pricing and Volatility or something like that for more insight."

optionseller,1613157805.0,"It doesn't matter what your entry price is. When an option expires it's value is max(0, share price - strike price) for call option. If stock is at 200, and your call is worth 20k at expiration (now), it means your strike must be $0. So your example is unrealistic

Suppose your strike is 100 and stock is at 200. The contract MUST be worth $10k at expiration. Why would market maker buy? Because when you place the sell order between the bid ask spread, market maker watch out for your order and the movement of the underlying stock, if stock moves in your favor, they can snap your sell order, exercise it, and sell the shares at a profit (a very simplified example). For example if you placed a sell order of the call at $10000, but then the shares moves up to $201, you left $100 profit on the table, and market maker takes it as their profit. IT DOES NOT MATTER HOW MUCH YOU PAID FOR IT AT THE FIRST PLACE

Even if they make a few cents per orders, it adds up rapidly as they process millions of trade per day"

The only thing that would have made this better overall was if Organized Play wasn't suspended because of Covid. Because I think you'd have a lot of people attending tournaments and such this year because of the hype (even if they reason they went was to sell their cards), because that's where you get the long-term purchasers, the people like me who are buying boxes and boxes of boosters to build decks, instead of keeping them sealed in the closet hoping to make some money off of them in the future."

JamesMacWorthy,1613157831.0,"Hopefully, the mods can just re-direct their thread to the GME sub."
USFederalReserve,1613157832.0,"The more new people that join, the longer it takes for us to return to the mean. As we're returning to the mean, if more new people join in another media wave, then the time to return to the mean increases. Its easy when there's like 1mill people here and we get 200k new people from r/all - in a week or two, they're all acclimated. 

But when wave after wave joins in increasingly higher volumes, then the ability for the community to remain organized and maintain it's ebb and flow basically drops to 0. For every 1 regular that's used by a new person to guide them in WSB culture, there's now 6-10 new people who are talking just as confidently and matter of factly about the community. Ironic that I have a young account saying this - but only if you use account age as a metric. Most reddit OG's in general rotate accounts. Plus aged accounts for astroturfing botnets are extremely cheap to buy. 

So if account age isn't reliable as a reference point, if confidence isn't reliable isn't reliable as a reference point, and if the culture present today isn't reliable as a reference point, then how does WSB return to normal? 

It doesn't. We have an AMAZING mod team but no one can wrangle a community this big, let alone dictate cultural norms. It's even harder with WSB since its built on ideals of counter-culture. It wasn't long ago that WSB would shut down if there was an article posted about it or if a WSB post got x-posted and upvoted into r/all. 

Things have changed, all we can do is help shape it for the better over time. There are satellite communities that retain different phases of WSB's cultural growth for those who are unwilling or unable to help shape the future here. 

> GME May have been the worst thing to happen to his sub

I think it may have some really dramatic unforeseen consequences down the line for retail as a whole. Right now farming retail forums/boards is really hurting large communities that share plays. While hedge funds have always sought to disrupt and exploit alpha being posted online, its never been more prevalent, the users have never been so largely grouped while holding both cash and an inability to entertain contrarian perspectives on stocks, and it's never had such large market-wide consequences. 

I imagine some form of regulation will be put into place and I believe the SEC will really start coming down on astroturfers, although their ability to quickly investigate those rings may fall flat, which opens the door for regulation to nip it in the bud."

The real question is if they gain the momentum to beat the theta decay, and leaps set you up with TONS of theta to burn until the position becomes profitable.

But maybe this will be more like 2012/2018 than 2008/2020.

I think a lot of stuff is overbought and it will start selling off, and then people will lose money, and then they'll start going to bonds and right around then they'll raise rates, maybe a point a month or whatever like last time.

That would be best case. It will soon be time to care about P/E and PEG and all that shit. I think smart money will move from overbought to big and safe, 3M will go up, and idk, fucking some battery company will go down. 

But it's tempting expect a fucking y2k crash too. Everyone and their mom is a wallstreet investor just one lucky play away from being a millionaire. That's gotta correct. Hopefully it's a careful one and not a catastrophic one."

Which makes sense since, assuming the price doesn't change at all from the time I sell my option back to the market, the net proceeds to someone who bought it, exercised and sold the stock would be $0 as they would pay $10k for the option and would net $10k from the exercise and sale.

So Monday the market being closed is a extra day for options to decay and Tuesday movement will have to be big enough to make up for missing a day, if the movement is not there options lose 3 days of momentum"

blatant_marsupial,1613162105.0,"Suppose a stock is $50. Calls for $52 cost a dollar and expire in two weeks. If the value goes up quickly, you can make substantially more gains for the same initial investment.

Say the stock goes up to $53 by the expiration date. Every dollar invested in shares nets you six cents. Every dollar invested in options nets you a dollar --- 16 times as much!

In short, they're a way to profit on stocks going up and down with less initial investment, at the cost of premiums and greater risk (and potential reward) per dollar."

Edit: That being said, if you took a massive massive loss, then you might want to pull out and recover since the risk is pretty large. Puts are just naturally risky, I feel they're more riskier than calls, tbh."

blatant_marsupial,1613162783.0,"Buying calls below share price can actually be good --- it's capitalizing on gains with less risk, at the price of the premium. They're still betting on the stock going up.

Suppose a stock is worth $100. I buy some $50 calls that expire in a month for $55 each. My ""break even"" price is $105, so I lose money if the stock doesn't go up or down.

However, if the stock goes up to $150, I can exercise (or sell) my calls for $45 profit! I've made slightly less than the profit of owning a share, but around half the initial investment.

In other words, you can stretch your investment dollars farther by buying calls instead of shares, but you have the extra restrictions of 1) a premium that may not be favorable 2) an expiration date and 3) being taxed as income rather than capital gains."

I didn‚Äôt have any real reason for exiting other then I felt there was too much hype with SNDL and wanted to exit the options.

I also sold 2 calls at 1.10 each for my 200 APHA shares that expire here at close (ended up being the perfect time to set up those calls). So I‚Äôm pretty much breaking even on my APHA right now, planning on selling some more calls on them next week. I didn‚Äôt make a 10 bagger but did pretty well on a couple trades here at the end of the week. I got lucky getting in on the weed stocks earlier this week so there wasn‚Äôt too much DD on my end other than a couple posts and comments among the GME noise that was going on.

They get called away but making 15-20% premiums plus 20-30% on share rise in a week or two is a pretty solid game plan.  TLRY, AMC, GME were way more casino plays and it is going to take a lot of covered calls to make up that $8 drop on AMC or $60 drop on GME.  I was buying into the price changes pretty heavily and just selling right away for more calls.  This is fine if things hold relative value or go up within the short time windows but kind of screws you if a stock loses 50% in a day or two."

brad4498,1613169060.0,"Well other than the relatively small reduction in profit from the put premium, the upside on the call side is still unlimited.

Edit to add. 
This would also be something you would put the base of your capital into. You could still throw a few percent more towards further OTM calls on the same ticker and again it would help to limit the downside and allow a good arb window where you can be near break even through 435 let‚Äôs say but from 450 and up the gains go more exponential because of the higher OTM calls you have. And if it stays below that price the OTM go to zero, but the gains on the initial leap will mostly offset the premium on the further OTM options. This might have a negative EV overall given the low probability of it mooning enough to hit the OTM calls. But it would still provide minimal capital risk with unlimited upside"

Their autonomous driving system, is fundamentally worse than a LIDAR integrated system, which one day will be cheap enuf for avg user. Having more data is good but at one point everyone has enuf data to optimize. The data is only as good as the problem u r solving and the way u solve it.

HiMyNameisAsshole2,1613190814.0,"After a lot of digging through articles, user guides, broken links on their website, and videos.  You're right, it does require two fingersticks for calibration daily, but not for treatment decisions after calibration which is really disappointing.

Compared to the freestyle libre, which requires no fingersticks for treatment or calibration.

Nontheless this is the first version, and in the future I think it's very likely due to competition that they will be able to remove or reduce calibration fingersticks.  If they can do this before the competition catches up to the longevity of their product which is 3 months in the US but has been approved for 6 months in the UK from what I can tell.  So we may see 6 months in the US at some point also.

I'd like to congratulate you on your awakening. I'd recommend watching Aba and Preach on Youtube. They are pretty fair and equal to either gender. 

Have u unsubbed from any titty streamers yet? My only thing against titty streamers is actually Twitch moderators because they allow titty streamers but no testicular tassels. #make\_testicular\_tassle\_streams\_a\_thing #MTTSAT #willy\_body\_painting #WBP"

Analysts think GameStop was just the beginning and there can be new short squeezes coming soon. Here is a good article discussing 20 most shorted stocks right now and why there is big chance retails investors might be targeting them next: [https://mosttraded.com/2021/02/14/these-20-heavily-shorted-stocks-could-be-the-next-gamestop/?fbclid=IwAR3yTQacLeyeAhhFiVdfbpvEmWUFtQiF6P-qSQm0Bj\_YeL-VQoKAsot0lOM](https://mosttraded.com/2021/02/14/these-20-heavily-shorted-stocks-could-be-the-next-gamestop/?fbclid=IwAR3yTQacLeyeAhhFiVdfbpvEmWUFtQiF6P-qSQm0Bj_YeL-VQoKAsot0lOM)

Would you bet on any of these stocks? Do you think they can be next?"

Discofootman,1613396325.0,"Too kind, may just have to consider it for the solidarity. What expiry/strike you got them puts for?"
Discofootman,1613396482.0,No real basis besides the volatility and potential for a bounce. Less so a short squeeze and more hype and speculation driven but definitely overextended but maybe the hype is somewhat real. APHA probably safer bet than TLRY though and not gonna trade them for a week or so unless a breakout begins to occur.
Discofootman,1613396558.0,Unfortunately you gotta know when to sell when the energy be ebbing like this. Could be wrong but I sold @ $40. Not happy about it and should have taken profits the day before. Price of greed.

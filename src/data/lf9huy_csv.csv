Peloton is selling senior convertible notes for Class A stock, and simultaneously using the balance sheet to buy call options on itself to make the notes anti-dilutionary. This means the options counterparty is going to buy roughly $600M worth of PTON stock in the immediate future and they won’t be allowed to sell likely until the notes are exercised probably in 2026.

Who cares what happens in 6 years, this is essentially PTON forcing someone to buy 600MM of PTON stock based on numbers on their balance sheet."

ogizhelev,1612796124.0,"Opinions on Ocugen, Inc. (OCGN)?

&#x200B;

Ocugen is a biopharma company that normally specializes in developing treatments for blindness. However, it was announced a couple days ago that they had reached a deal with Indian pharma company Bharat Biotech to be the exclusive developer/distributor for Bharat’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate, Covaxin, in the US market. It already has emergency approval in India and appears to be having success, while also holding some advantages over other vaccines on the market, most notably that it can be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius.

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ocugen-bharat-biotech-announce-execution-142700880.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ocugen-bharat-biotech-announce-execution-142700880.html)

&#x200B;

This news caused the stock to shoot up 70%+ since 2/2. I became interested in the stock for its future potential, since if it manages to win over significant contracts in the US it could propel the stock even higher, so I started doing my due diligence. In doing so I found something very odd. A few years ago this stock, which went from $1.70 to \~$3.50 in the past couple days, was worth nearly $150 in late 2018. Before that it was worth $500-600 back in 2015. The price of the stock steadily declined for a few years but was relatively stable from the end of 2016 to late 2018. But then, in September 2018, it fell off a cliff and in less than 6 months it tumbled nearly 170% by Feb. 2019 and never recovered. I’ve been trying to search old articles to determine what happened at that juncture but I’m drawing blanks. Did anyone else have their eye on this one or have any recollection about what happened during that time frame?"

Despite the hate I think Robinhood’s ad was a good play by them.

Superbowl ads carry a lot of weight in middle/lower class families in the U.S. if you aren’t aware. Almost every family I knew growing up got as excited for the ads as the game every year. And just about every family I knew watched the Super Bowl every year. Pseudo-national holiday (and I’m not even into football.)"

PTON gets $600M in cash and they put down $600M in the liabilities column. That’s it. The note buyers are investing in PTON in a way that minimizes their risk. 

The options counterparty (the call seller) has to actually buy the stock in order to hedge. Either as an OTC transaction that gets reported later or on the exchanges."

Bkbunny87,1612797747.0,"They haven’t scaled up DoorDash option to nation wide, but tested it over the holidays in big cities like Boston. It immediately took over their already healthy buy online, pick up in store business.

Essentially it was crazy convenient to shop via buy online pick up in store, and that huge demographic was thrilled at the option to get same day delivery. 

Scaled up I don’t think this will save brick and mortar retail. But I do think paired with a lot of changes Macy’s has made + them being the only physical retail location left in many areas (which is huge), at least in 2021 this is a great buy. They are set up to pick up a lot of market share this year."

LaPulgaAtomica87,1612797977.0,"**PSA for QQQJ**
---------------------------------------------------------

If you're bullish on tech and you're also confident on 2021 being a recovery year for beaten-down stocks, then there is no easier and safer play than  **QQQJ**. 

It is attractive because:
1) Unlike QQQ which is overweight in the big tech giants, QQQJ has tech but also has significant holdings in healthcare, consumer discretion and industrials.
2) If 2021 is indeed a recovery year, then there is more upside to QQQJ since it contains more beaten down stocks than QQQ.
3) For options, IV is still relatively low. Show me another ETF stock that has gone up 26% since November 1 with IV as low as 25-30%. Premiums on QQQJ are ridiculously cheap. 
ARKK, ICLN etc have all gone up higher since November but check their IV and option premiums.
4) It is fairly consistent. On deep red days, it doesn't tank too severely and on hulk-dick green days it doesn't rocket like ARKG or ICLN. It just reliably goes up gradually. 

I predicted in December that QQQJ will hit $35 by end of March once its constituent companies reported blowout Q4 earnings and give optimistic guidance for 2021 (due to a vaccine being available and an actual competent administration). However, at this rate, it may even hit $35 before end of February! 

I'm unashamedly the biggest shill for QQQJ on wsb (check my post history) but for good reason because it hasn't let me down yet. If you want steady and consistent gains, you really can't go wrong with this one. Again, this isn't $100 to $1 million in a month play. It's more like $10,000 to $50-70k in 3 months play: slow and steady. Just something to consider as you chase meme stocks and ETFs with ludicrous IV and premiums. 

Have a nice day and make a lot of tendies today!"

I heard about Lucid the first time when in 2017. Back then your statement was true that they don't have a working product. But they've been working on this for ages. Have you been living under a rock? ""Has no product""?

They might not have sold any cars yet but having no product is a wrong statement when they already offer pre orderings"

You want the US multi state operator companies. Individually, they're on OTC markets because of the federal prohibition on weed.

A lot of people will talk about APHA and TLRY. Those aren't a bad idea, but they're Canadian companies not as well positioned to benefit from US legalization. And they've already run up so much, the upside risk is more limited and downside risk inflated.

One individual ticker in MSOS holding is Cresco Labs. CRLBF on the OTC market. They're vertically integrated with a bunch of dispensaries in illinois. Another interesting ticker held by MSOS to research is IIPR, a REIT for US cannabis grow facilities."

Someone just told me they can short GME for 2 million shares on IBKR at 5% interest right now. So I'm expecting the short data to be less than people are expecting. 

That means we're probably going to see downside volatility for all the meme stocks as algos are correlating them right now.

Holding spy calls until atleast $400. Then I’ll sell and rebuy the next dip. 

I’m actually starting to think $60 is the new floor for gme. I thought it would be $40, but it’s held somewhat nicely in this range for a few days. 

If it drops to $50 I’ll buy some more. For short term bounces. But still very wary of it. 

I’ve been hoping to catch another dip on Baba, but looks like it might be too late. But I’m considering a leap on it. 

Nothing looking like a buy for today."

skaiyly,1612799676.0,"Agree and apparently amc is down because one of the main investors is selling a bunch of shares. [Link here] (https://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2021/02/08/chinese-investor-wanda-prepares-to-sell-amc-stock.html) but I'm going to take this situation as a good thing, because hopefully it'll open up talk for amc to begin a new partnership maybe the rumors with amazon or netflix will beco.e true"
SugaryPlumbs,1612799676.0,"Because ETFs (particularly new ones) don't always match their underlying value and can drift. Currently QQQJ is about 3-4% ahead of the growth since the end of October on NGX that it is supposed to be tracking. Obviously NGX has been going up by the stocks in it, but that doesn't account for QQQJ to be growing faster than NGX. Typically an ETF that tracks an index underperforms slightly due to fees involved in buying and selling shares, as well as timing not being instantaneous with the related index. It probably will continue to trend up for the next two weeks, but it is very likely that it will eventually stall while the underlying assets catch up in value. I will wait for that to happen and see that the ETF continues to track correctly before I jump in."

Why would they care if you are holding? They probably loaded up on more shorts when it was $350, and made tons of cash on the shares that they borrowed from your 💎 🧤 account."

Please remember: if you're YOLOing or betting money you don't have (a very bad idea), you have to understand that there can be very real, very painful consequences for yourself and those you love.  Wallstreetbets is exactly what it says it is - it's a betting forum. It's gambling on stocks.  More often than not, the house wins.  As for Alex, this news story is old, but read up if you don't know what happened re: RobinHood:  https://old.reddit.com/r/news/comments/lfc1ms/alex_kearns_died_thinking_he_owed_hundreds_of/?ref=share&ref_source=link

I unfortunately lost my pad sometime last year due to COVID, and moved back in with him till I found a job/new place. He’s a hotshot tech guy, but sometimes really fails to overlook things, sometimes cuz I think we may have generational differences. He hit it big right before the infamous .com bust 2 decades ago, so he always brags and holds himself ahead. He runs the show but fuck it sometimes is hard getting along with him at this age.

RoboGoodie,1612800250.0,"I don't know how AMC got wrapped up in the meme craze, and I'm annoyed that it's gettin beat up by the suits right now.

It will likely triple in value by the end of the year.  Here's why:

1.  It has the money to last out the lockdown
2.  Studios are not making the $$$ they thought they would by streaming them.  People aren't flocking to HBO max, or paying an extra $35 ont top 9f a Disney+ subscription.  And pirates are back!  So many new films easily pirated.  Why subscribe or pay extra when you can pirate a film on day one of release.
3. Big screen TVs are cheaper than ever!  Wait stupid 🦍! doesn't that mean that people will stay home?!  No dumb 🦍.  Nobody wants to stay home.  Staying home sucks.  We've all done that too much.  
4. AMC has been busy renegotiating all of their properties.  You don't think they are going to get a sweetheart deal to keep a theater open?  Landlords cant afford to have that kind of hole in a property.  They have to demo the buildings to make anything else.  It would cost crazy $$$.  Better deals means lowered overhead.
5. Same deals are going to happen with the studios.  Low subscription and pirates are going to make them realize that the best money they can make on a movie is IN A THEATER.  Who has the most theaters?  AMC.

This should never have been a meme, but it is going to be a $15-20 investment over the next year.  It totally could hit $35 next summer if things go well.

$6 is a great deal for the brand.   The suits won't agree.  There are still lots of shorts out there.  And year there will big swings, but it's a good company going through a transformation with a bright future.  Heck, you'll probably be able to watch the movie about the great GME AMC short, in and AMC theater.

Not advice.  Just pointing out what I thought should be obvious.

MOVIES AT HOME SUCK!

Be excellent to eachother!"

BenRobNU,1612800626.0,"Only way you can ""get out"" of a stock is selling a position, I don't know what the other nonsense in the first 3 paragraphs is about

The 30 day rule you're referring to is likely the ""wash sale"" rule. If your avg cost basis for sold shares is higher than the price you sell at (thus losing money on a trade) then you can't claim it as loss for tax purposes if you buy the same security (symbol) within 30 days."

30% children with $4 invested egging people on for another short squeeze so they can buy a PS4

30% WSB OG members both trolling and arguing with the above 70% and also arguing with some convincing trolls.

Seasalty99,1612800683.0,Yeah I rode that up back in 2012 or 13. Then sold at the top. Bought some shares on the way down and bag held for years. Let go of the shares a couple years back.

Gyis,1612800685.0,"How would buying a stock get you out of that stock? The lowest point you could drive your cost basis too is the current cost of the share. This will never be below zero. So you could never exit this way. The only way to exit a position is to sell. 

You can buy and sell shares the same day if you like. But this will trigger a day trade. You get three free ones every week then the fourth one restricts your account for a week unless you have $25k in funds. But there is nothing from stopping you from selling all of your shares one day and buying them all back the next. There is no 30 day trading limit"

natenicholson,1612800887.0,"Nio dd that I did for people who actually wanna trade a stock that won’t go bankrupt(cause they already did once😉)

Now that we have 8.6 million degens here it’s time to discuss the bull case for my favorite stock.... NIO

Chinese Tesla has treated me extremely well this year and I’m PROMISING you guys that we will see growth to 100 per share before the end of the year. 

My bull case....🚀

EV craze has just begun. The world is slowly integrating itself into a place devoid of combustion engines. As much as I love the sound and performance of a combustion engine I just don’t think they’ll be around for to much longer. With that, integration of a green new deal will completely change the US regulatory systems regarding emissions. The Green New Deal is a congressional resolution that lays out a grand plan for tackling climate change.

Introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, both Democrats, the proposal calls on the federal government to wean the United States from fossil fuels and curb planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions across the economy. It also aims to guarantee new high-paying jobs in clean energy industries.

That beings said, trade tariffs will be decreased under Biden with China. This will allow for easier Chinese exports of cars, such as vehicles from nio, to be introduced to the United States.

Chinese are said to be posturing to win EV over by setting a 2025 goal to make 20 percent of its auto sales plug-in hybrids or battery-powered electric vehicles (EVs). China has around 240 million passenger vehicles today meaning that 48 million of them would be EV by 2025. 

Deliveries have been insanely good. Breaking records in a constant uptrend for the past year.... they’re aiming for 120000 deliveries in 2021 which is 274% greater than this year’s 43,728 deliveries. 

They’ve integrated some of the best new tech into new vehicles including... the NVIDIA DRIVE Orin™ system-on-a-chip (SoC) for its new generation of electric vehicles, which will offer advanced automated driving capabilities.

NIO is working to make consumer adoption of smart, performance-packed electric vehicles a widespread reality. At NIO Day, the company’s annual customer event, the EV maker revealed its NVIDIA DRIVE Orin-powered supercomputer, dubbed Adam, which will first appear in the ET7 sedan that will ship in China starting in 2022. NIO was the first to put the 1,000km range on its ET7 sedan specification, to be fitted with a 150kWh solid-state battery when it goes into production in 2022. This KILLS TESLA. 

Cameras also kill Tesla....NIO Aquila Super Sensing features 33 high-performance sensing units including an ultralong-range high-resolution LiDAR, 11 8MP high-resolution cameras, enhanced driver monitoring system, 5 millimeter wave radars, 12 ultrasonic sensors, redundant high-precision localization units and V2X. It redefines the standards of autonomous driving sensing systems.

Long term - WKHS is looking good to get EV contract by feds and BCRX just created a new industry leading product

I highly suggest reading through daily DD for tickers then doing your own DD on those tickers

This is not financial advise"

I had 58 shares total, and had sold it off for gains each time, with some of my sell orders at only 8.80 a share, then up in the high teens, high twenties, and then above 50.  If I held them right now, they would be worth over 11,000 dollars.

AUX4,1612802683.0,I like Shell - they are my largest holding in energy - but i also have some Chevron and BP as well as some other smaller cap stocks. Im not big on dividends so the XOM dividend isnt really a factor for me. If they dropped the dividend to 3% and reinvested the money I would be much more bullish. $51 is probably where XOM should be - in this market it'll probably exceed it.

_Dude-,1612802717.0,"I have 5 call option contracts on XOM expiring on 4/16. Here are the stats:

Cost: 270

Current Value: 1850

Delta: 0.6235

Gamma: 0.0539

Theta: -0.0201

Vega: 0.0841

Rho: 0.0523

IV:   31.52% 

I am trying to determine when to sell. My original target was 30-45 days from DOE given what I've read about extrinsic value decreasing in that final month.

On one hand, I'm way up for one of my first options and think it may be good to take some money off the table (maybe I sell one or two of the 5 contracts and let the rest ride). But looking at the 3 month momentum of XOM, as well as the progress in the last week, I am considering holding for another month.

What are your thoughts? What am I missing/overlooking?"

I do believe in the real time rendering service they want to introduce in the industry, besides the video game sector. That has a lot of potential.

Kingo_Slice,1612803086.0,"While somewhat true, that is quite far from what they are known for.  They make almost every PC gaming component and peripheral you could ask for, aside from CPUs and motherboards (though they do re-brand other companys' motherboards as their own in some of their prebuilt custom systems).

They have been a powerhouse in computer memory for many years, and have vastly expanded their component line.  Additionally, just about every component they sell is very high quality.  I've owned multiple keyboards, currently own their wireless headset and prebuilt barebones BULLDOG computer case - which also uses THEIR highly rated modular power supply and water cooling system - and have used their RAM modules for years.  Never had any issues with any of these.  Built tough, work, and are competitive/affordable with pricing in my experience.

They have been pedaling their iCue RGB gaming ecosystem for the last few years because it sells.  People like pretty lights.  But their products are top notch.  This company is worth way more than Logitech IMO, and LOGI is sitting at $114...  I'm definitely bullish on their future."

Voitheiaplx,1612803962.0,"Thats not really how it works. I spent 15600$ in 1000 palantir shares. If I sold them at 45000 and rebought ar 40000 then I’d have basically spent 10600€ for 1000 palantir shares. So my cost basis would actually drop to 10.6$ (even if the app would say 40$). 

The problem is the timing that I’m describing which is really about luck (the only element that makes it not entirely luck is my “prediction” that when insiders will be able to sell, price will drop). But there are a thousand other reasons that it may not drop or drop even further. 

I have more restriction as my job doesnt allow me to trade something inversely for 30 days. So once I sell it, I cant rebuy for 1 month. So timing it is even harder."

giovanny2214,1612803980.0,OCGN is approved and distributing vaccine in India right? And is looking to apply to fda for approval for use in US. India is packed with like half the worlds population so im guessing this is why its doing this. Sadly i sold my 300 shares 3 weeks ago at $2.60 to fomo into GME.

Rootenheimer,1612805293.0,"Part of it is the idea of a normie, whatever the fuck that is. Every one of us is a normie, unless you're a professional trader, in which case you probably aren't here.

Mainly, it's that the stock needed to be allowed to go however high it was going to go, then crash back down again, without Robinhood deciding when to pull the brakes. Everyone playing GME knew there would be a top, and that they were playing with fire to try and time it. Every single person knew this. People were going to get burned. Doesn't give Robinhood any right to create the top. A lot of people bought in on the upward momentum through Thursday and never saw gains they would have had Robinhood not halted trading.

If your point is simply that Robinhood prevented some people from losing money by halting the stock, sure. Of course it did. They put out the fire. If you think that's a good thing, why stop at GME. Let's randomly prevent trading on all hot stocks. Chaos."

Marathon has lousy acerage.  There are better plays.  I am a big fan of Oxy.  They have the best Permian acreage by far and they have so much debt that their price got beat down the absolute most.  But even with all their debt the breakeven is 38 bucks a barrel (Chevrons is in the 50's for comparison).

AmericanHerstoryX,1612806485.0,"i personally love movie theaters. but all the biggest releases this year are going to hbo max at the same time (albeit for just like a month), and i think that is a trend that will continue and even increase. One good marvel movie attracting a crap ton of people to the theater will not save an entire movie theater chain. like i said it might see a jump, but i don't expect it to be an immediate opening of every seat in every theater so it'll be a more scaled back reopening and so there will not be a huge pop in revenue all at once, and therefore not a huge pop in value. in my opinion.

people say a lot of shit, they've been saying shit like ""save the theaters"" for years now, AMC has tried like VIP subscription services to skip lines or get a free movie a month or something like that. Look at their 5 year chart. *five years*

i don't think they're a worthless company, but i see no reason to be bullish. where's the growth?"

Could a ton of people decide to jump in considering the Vaccine contract in India.. India being a HUGE market who knows but how many actually are buying due to that news or just momentum trading? Willing to bet many people who have the stock don't even know what they do or the fact that the vaccine contract in india is big money. Longer term due to the actual business fundamentals it'll keep going up but today's spike continuing  is iffy.

slowdynamics,1612806975.0,"The Premonition
10 years ago I had a dream. An actual dream, the ones that you have while sleeping. It was about a stock price and WSB is the only place that have enough autists to hear me out.

The Dream
I live in Switzerland, never set foot in the Southern Hemisphere and knew then as much as the average Jerry about the Oil & Gas industry. I get this dream of an 8$ stock price of a company in Australia, Triangle.

Quick search and it does happen to exist a company listed on the ASX called Triangle Energy. Shit’s getting weird.

Bought stock and hold. Nothing happens. Fast forward a decade, I know more about the O&G in West Australia than the board of BP. Loaded up to buy a second hand Lambo (mind you, a low milage one). Total retard.

The Rationale
Somehow, they are the biggest shareholder of another company who is about to find more than 6Tbf of gas in eastern Australia. To put that in perspective, the same discovery in Iran made the headlines of CNN.

TEG have an offshore platform, pipeline, stabilisation plant etc running at a fraction of capacity, they have a commanding acreage position to explore with several high quality leads. They have about $28m worth of stock in GAS which is progressing rapidly towards being a takeover target for the majors wanting to secure additional gas.

The replacement value of the production assets is >$450m so these are of significant value to anyone wanting to produce oil in the area. There’s also the ability to toll treat oil from regional discoveries as well as any further discovery made by TEG. 

The assets also carry significant value as a platform to support renewable energy initiatives. 

There’s a scenario where these assets are valued closer to replacement value, be it thru exploration or partnership. 

In my view this is why TEG is going to rerate. Now if this does occur then perhaps we begin to look cheap at $100m MC?

The Takeaway
One of their prize asset is called Wagina. Need I say more on the lol potential if this blows up?"

*hello darkness my old friend*"
MagicSticks51,1612807160.0,I respect that. The phaseal opening is the only thing that has me tentative as well. I just feel like the pop off will be just good enough to invest in just due to people wanting to be out. There will still be plenty of introverts using hbo max to watch things but personally there's just too many streaming services out there and they're all expensive so most lower middle class or even middle class won't all have the exact streaming service streaming their movie. Disney charges extra for their movie streaming which at that point you'd rather go to a theater (imo). In ALL honesty tho I'm a broke mofo who can only throw in so little at a time so small stock at a good price that I feel will have a larger percentage uptick is worth it to me lmao. I only want it FOR that small burst you're talking about. I just hope it's not as staggered as it could be with those phased out openings. Any profit is good to me tho cause I'm a dumbass who barely joined in stocks and lost a shiny penny on gme lol I definitely don't plan on staying long in amc and was hoping more for the quick 6-9 month bubble.

Honestly still have A LOT to learn as far as I know options are timed contracts where you buy a larger amount for a premium price and you have the ""option"" to sell at a better price or something within that specified time frame?? Ive tried to figure it out I'm sorry. So betting on options is basically betting that within a certain time frame a stock will shoot up and then result is sweet gains is what wsb is about correct?"

if you're looking for *investment* though wsb is not the place, and i'd also say that AMC is not the stock. if your case for being bullish has nothing to do with the business model itself and is more just ""people say they want to go to movies"" you should probably do more research before putting your money into it"

What's my point in telling you this? Well imagine the banana peel as your meme stock of choice. Sure it got the dopamine a flowing at one time, but eventually you have to move on if you want to reap the rewards because they reached their peak already and other opportunities await."

I am rooting for cannabis long term, but there has been a HUGE run up on unrealized macro factors and we have seen time and time again that many of these cannabis companies simply don't run their businesses well (including CGC on more than one occasion). Some of the run up also seems to be based on pair trading against APHA/TLRY, Etc. That price relative to that merger also suggests is is overvalued. 

There is potential for yet another 10-20% earnings drop here. It's worth a small position given the risk/reward, imo."

I think IV has already been crushed for the most part, and another huge rapid sell off would in theory inflate IV assuming tomorrow is 🦍DDay if the SI is lower than expected. Perusing the GME thread has led me to believe tomorrow is a last chance of sorts for them to decide if the squeeze has in fact, already been squoze. In any case, far OTM puts are cheaper than I remember seeing them the last two weeks, I woulnd't throw a ton at the position, just noticed the premiums looked pretty dank if you were expecting another -50% this week on the underlying."

Keep trying until you get the right dosage that allows you to feel awesome and get your shit done. It’s gonna take some time so carry eye drops with you until you get it right. I’ve tried this. It was fun the first couple days then I fucked off a whole day and missed work and school and everything. Why do that when there’s way better shit. Cannabis is better.

Think about it, what screams Wall Street and Hedge Funds more than laying low on the GME stock and squeezing it in a couple of weeks when the retail investors have lost interest and sold? Its the exact kind of shittery they'd pull to ""win"" one over on retail investors in a massive ""fuck you, we own this game"". I'll hold it forever unless it blows up; I'm already 170 down, what's the rest in the grand scheme of things? I'd rather hold it and lose the remaining 70 than sell it and see the stock squeeze in a few weeks time.

That being said, if you're missing the money, cut your losses.

Head_Paleontologist,1612809676.0,"If you're just starting out, whether you got burned by a meme stock (or profited) or if you're entirely new, try playing with some ETFs first. You can pretty easily come up with some ETFs in industries or services that will come to and continue to benefit from where the markets are heading. Green energy ETFs, infrastructure ETFs, electric vehicle ETFs, raw materials for all the above ETFs, index ETFs etc. are all generally seeing strong, stable growth and deciding on which are strong is far easier than isolating individual companies and attempring to predict their future based on fundamentals and technicals when you're not familiar with the concepts."

Head_Paleontologist,1612810245.0,"Stock screeners will help you identify all the companies within a certain sector or industry. From there you can isolate based on specific indicators; say you want large cap companies with more stability then you can enter those criteria to exclude small caps with high volatility.

You also can read up on sector news and get a good idea of who has the intangibles, or things that won't be reflected by the numbers. Most reputable utility companies are going to have a diversified energy portfolio, but isolating the ones that are pivoting towards new technologies and expanding in to new markets can be done by reading up on the industry at large.

Right now I have leaps on AES, but no other specific energy stocks. For general infrastructure,  particularly roads and bridges, I'm in on AY, ROAD, and PAVE."

Both of those ended up on Bezos list of things to buy now.

Interesting comment from Googlestoleourpatent.

""David and Goliath story. Netlist (NLST) patent was stolen 12 years ago by Google after they signed an NDA to look at Netlists memory patent. Then Google promptly bootlegged it through a Chinese manufacturer screwing Netlist a California company. Google thought they could bankrupt Netlist but CEO fought back for 12 years and won a final victory against Google June 15 2020 when the federal appeals court upheld the lower courts decision against google in 78 claims with a rule 36 decision. Google exhausted all appeals and soon the USPTO will issue the new patent recertification upholding all 78 claims. Stay against Google will be lifted. Do your DD and understand this is a seminal patent that propelled Google to the forefront of searches with stolen Tech. Its time for Google to pay. Many of us believe that Google has paid manipulators to artificially deflate this stocks price. Check out their patent and see if you agree. Damage award should be in the Billions."""

I feel it's attached to GME again. For the past 3 days, BB traded independent from GME and managed to climb to $14.20 today while GME went down for the past week and FOR NO REASON it looks like BB attached itself to GME again and has since dropped from its AH 5.72% today because it seems it has trended GME.

&#x200B;

I've thought about it and decided I will chill and wait unless BB closes below $13.20 as that was the last closing price with no GME influence.

They're in the discount retail space (Tanger Factory Outlets), which is the way to go un the future.

We don’t play FD’s or far OTM short calls because it’s smart. We play because it’s a dopamine hit when it works. It’s like doubling down on 14 when the dealer is showing 19. When that 6 gets flipped over 1 out of 100 times, you literally beat the odds. It’s a rush. We’re not stupid,we’re regarded. We are nihilists."

YesAllHobbits,1612813507.0,"Virgin Galactic is pre-revenue so this is a very speculative play. They have scheduled a key manned test flight to space for this Sunday. This test flight failed back in Dec - but it also showed that automatic fail safe systems worked like they are supposed to. The fail safe killed the engine and the pilots safely glided back to Spaceport America. No explosions or anything crazy. It shows that even when things go wrong it is very safe. 



VG spent 2 months working hard to make corrective actions and improve the aircraft since then. So it’s looking very good that they will reach space. This is the first of 2 key test flights. If this is a success, they will fly again shortly after with researchers on board. Then flight #3 will be Richard Branson himself. Flight #4 and onward will be paying customers...we’ll have Justin Bieber and Ashton Kutcher on IG live from space. The hype will be massive. 




All of that potential is riding on this Sunday (or the next day if there is bad weather). Lot of pressure, but the company is signaling that they are very confident. This is from a very conservative (engineering-wise) company that does not like to make bold statements. 




Of course, if Sir Richard martyrs himself in a fiery space explosion, it is game over. So invest if you can handle that possibility. Odds are looking good imo but I’m also not a pilot or rocket scientist."

pm_me_ur_demotape,1612813756.0,"I'll let my link explain what IV really is and why, but I'll talk a little about what it means for us.  
Sometimes everyone expects a stock to go up. Maybe we know for sure they crushed earnings, or Sony is putting out Plastation10, or, for some reason we just all expect a company to do pretty well and for their stock price to show it. If buying calls on a company everyone expects to go up is a sure bet, then why would anyone *sell* the calls? If this were the exact scenario, nobody would sell calls because they would just lose the money. But in the real world, we don't all *know* 100% for sure the stock will go up, we just think it is really really likely. Well, for the right price, someone will take the opposite bet. That makes the calls really expensive and minimizes the profit made if the stock does go up. That would be a high IV situation. If everyone expects it to go up, say, 20%, but it only goes up 10%, it actually underperformed expectations. The really expensive calls were anticipating 20% and since that didn't happen, they get cheaper. The bet of selling them is less risky. If you're holding them when they get cheaper, you lost money.  
To profit, you really need to know (or guess/estimate) price movement that nobody else is expecting. If everyone thinks a stock will stay the same or go down, the calls will be cheap. If you believe everyone is wrong, you can get these cheap calls and if you are right, when the price goes up the calls will go up to match the risk of selling them. If you are wrong, you lose."

LOP5131,1612813943.0,"Today is the first time I looked at call options and noticed that some had -% to breakeven. Example: $10 call expires 1/1/22 and cost $9. Current stock price is $20/share. Meaning if I spent $900 on the call, executed immediately and spent $1000 on the shares. I'd be in at $1900 and could sell instantly for $2000. Obviously short term gains tax out of that, but why would this ever be the case? Guaranteed profit if you execute it all and the stock doesn't drop 5% in the 30 seconds it takes to execute it all."

It’s good thinking for sure, but at least for me I wouldn’t bet on a company like this going down while we emerge from the pandemic. It would be like buying puts on Southwest because they’re going to have a bad earnings. It may have minor profitability in the short term, but I see more than likely a strong upward trend through 2021. There are more profitable and less risky plays elsewhere.

AMD, AAPL, even TSLA just doesn't seem like they has that much upside potential in the short term and it's tying up capital I could be throwing at some new spac or whatever. Stupid, I know."

listen to your gut, it's saying ""cash out, this may go wrong""

With the following catalysts coming up; get in before close today, tomorrow will be a BEAUTIFUL day for $APHA / $TLRY holders:

 

1. Merger w TLRY
2. U.S. weed legalization
3. U.S. weed banking reform
4. European expansion (largest and only facility in Germany!), footprint in Portugal, Malta and other countries
5. Biggest LP in Canada (highest revenues, biggest % of market share)
6. Strong management, already profitable, great execution
7. Significant arbitrage play with the merger (compared to TLRY price) - 20-25% at present

hockeyfan1990,1612818867.0,"Funny thing, I was selling my house in August, and the realtor that works with me moved from Remax to EXP Realty because the realtor company takes less from their commission they earn. He knows nothing about stocks, but he believed in the company and wanted to drop 5k in it. I saw it went up from $21 to $36 at the time and im like damn its gone up a lot. I helped him open an account and invest it. I also invested myself after doing bit more research on it. Solid company, no doubt its overvalued now.

That’s the story behind it lol"

You can prove it simply by asking random HS grads questions about those subjects, nearly every single one of them will fail to be able to answer yet they studied it and invested years doing so.

Its a horrible broken system and the main reason it stays intact is laziness and teachers afraid of real change.

We teach every student trigonometry, and yet 95% or more of us never ever use it in life.

The basics is what should be taught along with life skills, rent, investing, insurance, contracts, resumes, business startup, cooking, woodworking, repair etc. Imagine a school focusing on what matters in life.

Shamizzle,1612825991.0,"Canadian weed companies are well established and already have a lot of the framework in place for US distribution to mirror. I'm sure there will be US companies that pop up to reap the rewards of newly legalized business, but there will be growing pains as the rules are ironed out and taxation / federal regulations are figured out in real time.

The Canadian companies are in an advantageous position to capitalize by either consultation or licensing / partnerships if not opening a US arm directly. Consider a US distribution company that is under the umbrella of a Canadian parent company. That's how I envision this going, with the Canadian companies being propped up to the scale of alcohol or tobacco companies.

The real hurdles are the existing US distributors of similar products and lines (say, Philip Morris) because they have the opportunity to pivot immediately after sweeping federal restructuring.  But then, therein lies the risk in going long on Canadian weed. 

We don't know how it'll play out, but I like the thought experiment of imagining the landscape in 5 years.  Longer term, I think the market will dilute enough with competition to make these plays less relevant, but first mover advantage is my play right now."

I mean seriously, literally every term gets tossed around in here daily. Every time you see someone write something and you don't know what it means, just google it. Sometimes one site may not explain it well, just try the next one. Most webpages that explain this stuff have links to related topics, so you can follow those links and learn even more detailed info if you want. You'll get it in no time.

Update: (reply to below comment) I had learned all this stuff in college. I wasn't finance (accounting here) but I still opted for enough finance courses that I got the basics. Getting back up to speed for me Google was best because I could get my refresher as I needed. I think if I tried to read a resource that started from the beginning I'd be frustrated by it. So I guess it depends on how basic your basic understanding is. Maybe I was more ""intermediate"" so the ol' Google suited me fine :)"

punkypal,1612882037.0,"If you look at what Amazon has been making, it seems of all the streamers they put the most focus on quality. Their films can't be considered for most awards, including the Academy Awards if they don't release in theaters first. Amazon wants to gather award wins to boost their legitimacy as a studio. Also its would be a huge bonus to getting rights and signing talent. If they own the nations largest theater chain, they can offer guaranteed access to screens coast to coast as part of any deal. It gives them more leverage. Congress eased anti trust rules so a studio now can own the theaters too. Amazon lobbied to have that change made, and they have suggested that they are in the market to buy. Why would they push to have the rights to buy the theater and then not plan to do it?

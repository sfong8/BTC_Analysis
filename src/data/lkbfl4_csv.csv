As she calmly got out of her dress and into her jeans I explained that I was doing it for soon-to-be luxurious future. As she put her jewelry and toiletries in paper bags, I laid out gleefully and joyfully, step by step how rare it is to get shares like this under a dollar. As she put the dog in the back seat of her car I described the jaw-dropping vacation homes we will one day buy together in far, exotic lands. As she closed the trunk, got in the driver's seat and drove away, I walked down the driveway yelling after her how lucky we are to be on the same page about how to properly spend Valentine's Day money. She clearly heard me, for she waved back with one finger, lovingly and understandingly. Oh, what a wife!"

InIce1234,1613392933.0,"Apple car was just hot air, Volkswagen screwed up on their sales figures, Ford and GM have been building bad cars for over a century. Anyway, it's more about the technology that goes into electric cars and not the car itself. The car itself is just a tool to make money with the updates and apps. Somehow people haven't understood that. They still think it's about range, performance and quality.

As I said, quality, performance and range are secondary, but they have to be of a certain level. Tesla fulfils exactly this criterion - of course the quality of a Daimler, BMW or VW is way better, but they have absolutely no idea how to put software into a car. American carmakers have no idea about either quality or software. 

Actually, it's all about an industry standard. Apple is still the most dangerous for Tesla, as they are probably the company in the world that knows the most about AppStores, but they suck at building cars. 

As long as Apple doesn't buy up an established carmaker that can build high quality cars, which are really only available in Germany, I see absolutely no danger for Tesla (maybe a little bit through China).  

As long as this doesn't happen, Tesla's share price will continue to explode."

Relevant_spiderman66,1613395069.0,"Especially cause the science is off in his post. It starts claiming natural immunity lasts 90 days, but there is already a study on UK healthcare workers demonstrating that they were protected for up to 6 months (where the study ended, not where the protection ended). Plus, none of what he posted references T cell based responses. Antibodies/B-cells are only part of a response. Hell, I personally know of two people who can‚Äôt produce antibodies naturally (due to XLA), who both got COVID last March, got over it after a couple weeks, and have not gotten it again despite being very lax regarding lockdown restrictions. Conclusion: This guy is a retard (not in the good way) and is exactly what they talk about when they say people come here and try to manipulate stocks.

Edit- Holy shit, they also go out of their way to misrepresent some of those sources and pick/choose what they want. The CDC article goes out of its what to talk about memory B/T cells and immunity post 6 months. Someone‚Äôs  definitely shorting Moderna and trying to manipulate WSB. Even the T cell article is misrepresented. You see weaker CD8 responses with mild infection, but that has nothing to do with immunological memory. That shit will amplify in case of a new infection. Also he writes ‚ÄúT cell response is weak in most people‚Äù and cites that a CD8 response is more robust with a more severe infection; if man A weighs 700 pounds and man B weighs 300 pounds that doesn‚Äôt mean man B is skinny."

themop1,1613395232.0,Total individual and institutional ownership of $MDP is approaching 110%. That means that any share you buy is very likely being borrowed by a short seller that is looking to keep the value suppressed so that they can use the price action to cover. If we experience a high volume day the stock is going to increase very quickly as there aren‚Äôt enough available shares. The number of shortable shares keeps getting smaller everyday as new institutions initiate positions like the KOCH brothers just did with a new 1.6 million share position. The market cap is only 1.3 billion so with 110 percent ownership of the float every share purchase puts huge upward pressure. Institutions added very heavily to their positions last quarter and have had a month and a half to add even more. We are on the verge of a very big short squeeze if even one more buyer decides to take on a 5 percent position. Short interest is 4 million shares that don‚Äôt really exist in the market.

Use several of them if you have them available but if you have cats or anything that could knock it over use your best judgement about using any candles as a fire would be worse then staying warm in the cold.  Remember to layer clothes and move around when you start to feel too cold.  Don't over exert yourself to the point of sweating as that will cause more problems.  Bottom shirt should be a moisture wicking material, second layer should be wool if you have it, top layer should be something that would protect you from wind.  Wear 2 or more layers of pants!!!   Everyone always layers their upper body but almost always overlook layering their lower body."

To save money, he drives a 1998 Honda Civic, eats a lot of rice and lives with his dad. He stashed his savings mostly in diversified index funds.  
>  
>Then Mr. Vergara, a longtime reader of [the WallStreetBets page](https://www.wsj.com/articles/wallstreetbets-founder-reckons-with-legacy-amid-memes-loss-porn-and-online-threats-11611829800?mod=article_inline) on Reddit, saw others posting about buying GameStop shares and the stock‚Äôs colossal rise. He was so enthusiastic about GameStop Corp. in late January that he took out a $20,000 personal loan with an 11.19% interest rate from a credit union and used it to purchase shares. Then the buzzy stock plunged nearly 80%.  
>  
>""I thought it could go up to $1,000. I really believed in that hype, which was an awful thing to do,"" Mr. Vergara said.

1infiniteloss,1613405548.0,"No, these are calls on existing long positions. Exercising would be to add to my current positions. They are way in the money and hold minimal extrinsic.

I was half serious about the crash, but the reasoning was that I‚Äôd hate to exercise to own the shares and then a week later the market corrects. Obviously there is no way of knowing whether this will happen or not. The bull in me wants to exercise and add to collection and the conservative in me wants to take profits, which would give me a ton of liquidity to buy after a correction."

Shorts, if any, in now saw this thing over $350 a share. Hard to imagine they are concerned about having to cover anytime soon. So squeeze is out.

Value investors, well doubt many would want to pay much above $20 per share for this so they are out.

Who is left... The cult of the squeeze. If you guys have tens of billions and will all stick it out, you can probably bid this up to $500+ a share and see if you can shake any shorts out... Or more likely, you find bag-holders dumping their shares so quick as the price goes up (preventing it from ever going up high enough to squeeze) that anyone spending their money on this is simply going to watch it fly away. In other words, GME is currently a Ponzi scheme."

aka0007,1613408339.0,"It was a tough call. I sold most of my positions that Wed, but not all. I made a lot of money on it, but it was hard resisting the euphoria and greed that would have resulted in not making anything.

Logically there were reasons to question holding it further. Primarily for me it was concerns about liquidity. There was simply no logical way the stock could just go up without taking down the global financial system. It should have been obvious that either the brokers/clearing-houses would restrict trading or the SEC would. I get it people are mad about this, but the stock market exists to provide liquidity for companies, not to make market breaking trades. When a hedge fund shorts a company to bankruptcy it does not undermine the market, but if a short squeeze results in counter-parties going bankrupt and then the clearing-houses and brokers are on the line for these trades it does undermine the market.

In any case, I made a tough decision that Friday morning and closed out my remaining positions (those at a loss, although overall made very well due to closing most positions on that Wed), but could not close them quick enough. I decided that it was not worth looking back. The investment had become too toxic at that point."

Canada just bought 500,000 doses and OCUGEN doesn‚Äôt have to put money into development which is the most expensive part of vaccine distribution.

1. Easier to manufacture at scale (i.e. billions of doses)
2. Easier to distribute at CVS/Walgreens, since room temp is OK
3. Faster path to certification on children
4. Single dose, so it'll be more popular and logistally move twice as fast

Sell within market open unless pltr SKYROCKETS. But they probably won‚Äôt; they haven‚Äôt seen green on their balance sheets longer than some of us have been alive."

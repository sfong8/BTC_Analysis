Shroom stocks - Are they really the next big thing?

Several psychedelic mushroom stocks are backed by huge investing figures such as Peter Thiel and Kevin O'Leary. AKA üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

3 parts to this DD:

1. The science - why psychedelic mushrooms have huge potential as medicinal products.
2. The rise of mushrooms and psilocybin as pharmaceutical drugs
3. Specific stock recommendations and my positions

**My core thesis:** Psychedelic mushrooms have a lot of scientific evidence backing their beneficial effects for specific conditions. This means that eventually, psilocybin-based drugs are bound to get approved, which will drive the entire psychedelic sector up.

**1 - THE SCIENCE - WHY THEY HAVE HUGE POTENTIAL AS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS**

The evidence behind the effectiveness of psychedelics for various health conditions is piling up.

Harvard University: ""the study authors and the commentators ‚Äî who include Charles Schuster, former director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse; Nobel Prize winner Solomon Snyder; and nationally known addiction expert Herbert Kleber ‚Äî recommend revived investigation of the therapeutic and scientific uses of hallucinogens"" - [https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter\_article/Reviving\_the\_study\_of\_hallucinogens](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Reviving_the_study_of_hallucinogens)

Pharmacognosy Review: ""They are also one of the richest source of anticancer and immunomodulating agents. Thus these novel myochemicals from these mushrooms are the wave of future."" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3249912/)

3 Biotech Journal: ""This will further help the researchers to understand the metabolites and find other metabolites as well from the mushrooms which can be used for the potential development of the drugs to treat various life-threatening diseases."" - [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6056353/)

DEPRESSION: psilocybin therapy for a startup was given ‚Äúbreakthrough therapy‚Äù designation (a review fast track) by the FDA for the treatment of depression (more on this later).

Psilocybin therapy can help smokers abstain from smoking, according to a small pilot study: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641975/)

Another open label study found that it can reduce heavy drinking: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25586396)

A randomized, double-blind trial from Johns Hopkins in 2016 found that one single dose of psilocybin drastically improved quality of life and decreased depression and anxiety in people suffering from life-threatening cancer diagnoses: [https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0269881116675513)

SUMMARY: There is a huge amount of scientific evidence showing the potential of psilocybin against depression, heavy smoking and drinking, to improve quality of life in cancer patients, and as an anti-cancer agent. This medical evidence is not well known and relatively hard to find and analyze, making it an opportunity for the entire psilocybin sector.

**2 - THE RISE OF PSILOCYBIN DRUGS + SLOW DECRIMINALIZATION**

Psilocybin is slowly decriminalized in the US - Denver, Oakland, and Santa Cruz have legalized its use not long ago. Lawmakers in Ann Arbor, Michigan voted to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms and it's been legalized for therapeutic use in the entire state of Oregon.

I'm NOT claiming that full decriminalization is coming anytime soon. However, the Biden administration SHOULD in theory make at least partial decriminalization a real possibility.

However, my main argument is that it doesn't have to be legal on a major scale at all to explode. The real, major trend is the use and approval of psilocybin in pharmaceuticals.

Whenever a new field get such high amount of scientific studies proving its potential (see above), it's inevitable that startups and firms will try to create patented drugs to benefit from it.

And governments are starting to realize that targeted use of psilocybin for specific health conditions can be very beneficial. Which means that this opportunity is becoming more and more real and interesting for biotech companies.

According to [thekit.ca](https://thekit.ca) \- In Canada, ""The process is well on its way. In August 2020, federal health minister Patty Hajdu granted four end-of-life patients exemptions from current drug laws to use psilocybin to help deal with the anxieties of their terminal illness. (Fifty-three-year-old Laurie Brooks, who has colon cancer, was one of them‚Äîread her story next in our Psychedelics Now series). Three more exemptions quickly followed, perhaps a harbinger of restrictions being eased.""

In other words, various psilocybin-based drugs are being approved as we speak, all over North America. As we've seen with marijuana, Canada is usually a trend-setter - and approval of psilocybin pharmaceuticals in Canada is likely to lead to the same outcome in the USA.

As a matter of fact, it's already happening in the US. Like I said earlier, the startup Compass Pathways's new psilocybin treatment received ""breakthrough therapy"" status - essentially giving it a fast track to FDA approval.

This would have NEVER been possible under the previous administration, and is a sign of things to come.

SUMMARY: The current administration makes decriminalization of mushrooms more likely. However, even if full decriminalization is light years away, the FDA approval of psilocybin-based drugs and the same phenomenon in Canada is driving the entire sector way up. Again, this is due to the fact that mushrooms ACTUALLY WORK for a wide range of health conditions.

**3 - SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AND MY POSITIONS**

Now, with all this in mind - if the entire mushroom sector is bound to explode, which stocks do I recommend?

1. Compass Pathways ($CMPS) - No need for a huge explanation here. CMPS is the company whose drug received breakthrough therapy designation. This makes FDA approval significantly more likely. Probably the leading mushroom stock. Oh - and the stock is backed by Peter Thiel, too.
2. Mind Medicine ($MMEDF) - Kevin O'Leary invested in the pre-IPO round of $24 million. They're currently running clinical trials to measure the effectiveness of LSD for anxiety and headaches. The company focuses on psychedelic-oriented therapies for anxiety, addiction and ADHD - which are probably the most promising areas of research at the moment.
3. Champignon Brands ($SCHRMF) - Also using psychedelic medicine against depression, PTSD and other mental health conditions. They're already offering ketamine treatment for adults with depression in a rapid treatment center in Ottawa.

There are obviously other stocks, but I've vetted these 3 stocks for management integrity (extremely important in a sector like psychedelics) and long-term commercial viability.

My positions:

\- 1000 shares of $CMPS

\- 2000 shares of $MMEDF

\- 4000 shares of $SHRMF

Track record:

My last recommendation of $BG in WSB is now extremely profitable (called it at $70, now trading at $76).

AMC - THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER!,208,li8wkn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li8wkn/amc_the_fight_is_not_over/,61,1613156638.0,"A quick update on new information for all my fellow bag holder apes.

What's the case with AMC? Is the run over? Has the squeeze squozed?

No.

AMC's price jump back on the 27th of Jan was due to a high demand in the stock following the GME squeeze. People who did not want to miss out on an another opportunity wanted to jump on the next trend that was hot on WSB.

This, also explains the sudden drop in price of AMC. A lot of new members of WSB and novice traders who were looking to make a quick buck out of the momentum. Those who saw GME explode in a matter of days perceived that the same may happen to AMC. That, accompanied by numerous false expectations built up by Stocktwats and some WSB members, caused for all of those who had entered at the peak of AMC to suffer cognitive dissonance - i.e. FUD.

The number one rule of marketing is ""never create high expectations that you cannot meet"". Why? Because, while it may drive a lot of new clients in the short term, it will damage your brand and your company's success in the long-term. The same rule applies to practically everything else. In AMC's case, high expectation was created, dates were given, and when those expectations were left unmet - novice traders got spooked and closed their positions and sold their shares.

Accompanied by constant media bombardment of fear mongering news left and right, data manipulation, etc. I personally believe that this is what drove the price down. Some form of market manipulation could have had a play here, but I'd rather base my DD on more tangible reports rather than speculations.

Hedge funds are notorious for using media coverage and PR to influence the price of a security.

With all of that being said, why do I believe that AMC has an incredible potential to explode?

Utilization rate was 91.4% on the 8th of February:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vfzin8lg31h61.jpg?width=827&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=191039959e836a0385f6a05a9c252a14ad9be6af

And has since dropped to 88.4%, which is still quite high.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/98vvwidh31h61.png?width=353&format=png&auto=webp&s=743a2c23504fc1414b8a7e234d32274a4083a1d6

What this shows us is that about 89% of the stocks available to be borrowed have been borrowed. However as you can see the total number of shares on loan has increased - from 81.7m to 82.3m.

This just shows that the drop in utilization rate has dropped as more shares have been qualified as suitable to borrow - recently bought shares.

What else do we know?

We now know, thanks to Fidelity, that retail ownership of the stock is 87.5%!!!!

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0ew7hb2i31h61.png?width=640&format=png&auto=webp&s=16392e7dc6020f44715041681e16bb374d8d8dff

**Why's this exciting? Well, if we look at the exciting case of VolksWagen (VW):**

The short interest of the stock was about 13%. The main reason why it exploded was because there were no stocks available for short sellers to buy back was and cover their positions was very low as Porsche had increased its stake in VW to over 74%. Short sellers were forced to buy the stock back at what the supply (holders) were willing to give for it. Simply because they can do that.

So hedges have two options, accept defeat and buy back to close their positions and hedge their risk by buying some of those stock. Or, keep paying a hefty premium based on the floating APR, which changes literally everyday based on the volume.

Institutional investors are increasing their portfolio holding of AMC:

Vanguard - 55.46% increase worth, I dunno but they have bought 2.7M new shares.

Blackrock - 69% increase worth $13.17M

Northern Trust Corp - 41% increase worth $2.12M

And many more who bought into the stock recently:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cwuglgpj31h61.png?width=1209&format=png&auto=webp&s=74a91d31604f67497b7ced308e400eda66035f3a

We're also seeing a lot of people reporting that when they attempt to short the stock they are receiving error messages telling them **""This stock is hard to borrow"".**

**Such as Etrade:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xj13u0ck31h61.jpg?width=566&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e443aa0ce20eb70bf67584db89ba4950b54f5ee

**And the lightspeed platform:**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/hxn7536l31h61.jpg?width=827&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f5b2fb65078cae811d732e35928a52dcca6c7ae0

Which also reported that the available shares to short are 460k with a borrow fee of 4.5%.

Another report from NakedShortReport

shows us that the short volume of AMC was 40% yesterday.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9151j3io31h61.png?width=993&format=png&auto=webp&s=88f7e43c8e61ec57990b88419c777ad2fe842ae8

Naked short report collect their data from FINRA. But it's interesting to see that Fintel is reporting a 21% short volume. I've genuinely lost all hope in them by now.

**CONCLUSION**

What this leaves me to believe is that AMC is turning into a bubble for hedgies that is ready to burst any moment now.

Don't lose hope and hold your positions if you can. If you can't that's fine. Look after yourself first.

This is an extremely important lesson for newbie traders and investors for the number one rule of - Do not let your emotions control your investment decisions. This is probably the best stock to train that element.

Invest what you are willing to lose - especially when dealing with highly speculative and volatile stocks such as GME and AMC.

**For all of us who are still holding - stay strong. This might prove to be beneficial.** However, this is no guarantee, obviously.

Take everything I've said with a grain of salt and do your own research. I just wanted to share with you my personal speculation.

**Let me know what you think!**

The evidence is in the scientific studies, which show that these psychedelic and other illicit compound research companies have the most effective cutting edge mental illness treatment on the planet. Ketamine for example is the worlds most effective short term anti depressant. Magic mushrooms are shown to be the worlds most effective treatment at treating treatment resistant depression. Ibogaine is the worlds most effective anti addiction drug for heroin, with 77% of users in one study not relapsing when they didn‚Äôt return to their old enviornment. Lsd is shown to be incredibly promising to treat alcohol addiction. Alcoholics Anonymous started out using it actually. Mdma is considered the worlds most promising drug for treated PTSD AND CPTSD.

Am seeing a ton of Asian ADRs being shilled on here with the message being that they're cheap. Yes they are cheap, but there's a reason.

***Shitty Corporate Governance:***

I'm not completely familiar with Chinese and Japanese conglomerates (but have heard they're similar) so I'm going to focus on the Korean ones. Korean companies essentially exist for the benefit of the founder's families. Period.

People went off about corporate governance issues at Facebook and Snapchat during their IPOs due to founders controlling the company with ""only"" 22% and 36% ownership respectively... Samsung's ""owner"" controls the entire conglomerate with a 3.4% ownership stake.

[This is Samsung Group's Ownership Structure](https://preview.redd.it/jqvamel8m0h61.png?width=1260&format=png&auto=webp&s=41dbc7133b7a239b7f90b8c56787791b3ebf9461)

***Circular Holdings:***

A Korean company having a holding in another subsidiary isn't a good thing. It's a way for the founder to hold on to as much control of as many companies as possible with as little capital as possible.

The founder will have a stake in company A -> Company A has a stake in company B -> Has a stake in Company C -> Has a stake in Company A.

***Prices Held Down:***

Unlike the US where CEOs have bonus incentives to keep stock prices up (a different issue in and of itself), founders/CEOs in Korea have incentives to keep the price down. They want to keep the price as cheap as possible so that when they die the inheritance taxes are lower for their children. Seriously. Stock prices at these conglomerates go up when one generation of owners die as they're no longer held down.

The shit that these founders pull on shareholders make hedgefunds/wallstreet guys in the US look like saints. Nearly every founder of every major conglomerate in Korea has gone to jail for securities fraud/embezzlement/bribery. It's a shitshow.

Don't mess with Korean stocks (or Chinese, Japanese, etc) if the only reason is ""they're cheap"". They're cheap for a reason and they will be for a long time.",2021-02-12 17:44:01

TLDR: AWS's CEO will become Amazon's CEO, and together with JC he will make Futurama-esque air traffic a reality in the near future via AWS IOT and QNX/IVY.

Okay first things first. To dispel the notion that ""bLacKbErRy QnX iS foR caRS And iT haS notHinG to Do wITH DronES"" see: [https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/autonomous-systems/](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/autonomous-systems/) Literally the very first image on that page is a drone. QNX isn't just for cars. It's for all things autonomous including cars, trucks, evtols, drones, minority report spider bots, you name it.

Secondly, with regards to those who claim that ""Amazon can just program their own drones"" and thus has no need for BlackBerry, I implore you to check out BB's trove of Government certifications (link [https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/certifications](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/certifications)) and 40000+ patents (link [https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/](https://www.greyb.com/blackberry-patents-infringement-potential/)). 

With that out of the way, let's talk D-R-O-N-E-S

Here are a few more supporting evidence for my hypothesis:

December 2013 - Bezos reveals Amazon Prime Air, a R&D project to deliver parcels with ""octocopters"" He suggested it would be \~5 years or so before it is available to consumers. [LINK](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/amazon-unveils-futuristic-plan-delivery-by-drone/) Well, it's been 7 years now so we are already 2+ years behind schedule.

December 18, 2015 - Amazon file for patents pertaining to Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (LINK at bottom)

December 18, 2015 - AWS IOT (Internet of Things) launches [LINK](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-iot-now-generally-available/)

>""We built IoT Core because connected devices are proliferating. They are in your house, your car, your office, your school, and perhaps even in your body! Like some of our more advanced customers, we have been building systems around connected devices for quite some time. **Our experience with** [**Amazon Robotics**](https://www.amazonrobotics.com/#/)**, drones (**[**Amazon Prime Air**](http://www.amazon.com/b?node=8037720011)**)**, the [Amazon Echo](http://www.amazon.com/echo), the [Dash Button](http://www.amazon.com/oc/dash-button), and multiple generations of [Kindles](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle) has given us a well-informed perspective on how to serve this really important emerging market""

Is it reaching to suggest that Amazon very much had DRONES on their minds when they started AWS IOT on the same day the filed for UAV patents? Take a look at this [picture](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-MY-sGfWtWNrFljWJj01HIzWM34=/0x0:811x612/1120x0/filters:focal(0x0:811x612):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8738261/drone_interior.png) to get an idea of what Amazon had in mind.

Fast forward to 2020

In Jan 2020, AWS announced a collaboration with BlackBerry:

>""The platform will integrate the BlackBerry QNX operating system and over-the-air software update services, with **AWS IoT** cloud services for secure connectivity and telematics, Amazon SageMaker for developing ML models, and **AWS IoT** edge services for in-vehicle ML inference.""

Alright, so the purpose of this partnership is ""secure connectivity"", ""telematics (monitoring of vehicle)"" and ""ML (machine learning)"".. nothing that specifically points to drones yet

In June 2020, BlackBerry partners with DeDrone (a leader in airspace security):

>""New advanced technologies have the potential to solve some of today‚Äôs most pressing challenges, however, they also introduce new security risks,‚Äù said Christoph Erdmann, Senior Vice President of Secure Communications, BlackBerry. ‚Äú**Drones are one of the many IoT endpoints that add to the growing chaos that security leaders must navigate.** We‚Äôre excited to partner with Dedrone to offer a critical solution that organizations around the world can use to keep citizens and the public safe.‚Äù

Drones. Security. IoT. 5 months after Amazon and BlackBerry began their collaboration.

In September 2020, Amazon Drone Fleet receives FAA approval. Did BB have anything to do with it? Maybe, maybe not.

Alright, so let's pretend that you subscribe to this hypothesis that BB had a hand in Amazon's drone project. So what? BFD, right? How many drones are we even talking about? 20000? 50000?

Amazon delivers \~3 billion packages a year globally. Drones are by far the cheapest option for last mile delivery (contrast that with a dude wear khaki shorts driving a 2 ton truck from the Amazon fulfillment center to your condo) so it's no stretch to suggest that it will be Amazon's preferred method of delivery like 99%+ of the time. No, a drone isn't going to fly all the way from Seattle, Washington to your porch in Blaine.. but an autonomous truck might take your parcel from Seattle to Blaine and let a drone complete the rest of the journey. Or something. 

3 billion deliveries divided by 365  = 8.219 million deliveries per day. Even if drones can deliver packages to you in 30 minutes on average (60 min round trip) and worked around the clock with no need for recharging or maintenance, it would take 342465 drones. That's 342465 unmanned flying vehicles collecting flight data for IVY. 

I'm gonna stop myself here before this completely devolves into JC/Jassy fan fiction. The whole point of this coke bender DD is to suggest that BB's potential isn't merely ""OS for Cars."" In fact, cars only account for 175 million out of Blackberry's 500 million IOT endpoints. 

We're talking about drones, flying taxis, robots, roombas, fighter jets, tanks, and yes, EVs too. Essentially, anything that MOVES and CAN POTENTIALLY BE HACKED = $$$ for BB. I wager that there will be plenty of things in the future which fall into both of those categories.

Position: a modest amount of BB shares.

SKM undervalued. I like the stock,0,li6scx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li6scx/skm_undervalued_i_like_the_stock/,21,1613146505.0,"üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
This isn't financial advise, I'm not an advisor of any kind. I just like this stock and rocket emojis too. 
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ
TLDR: SKM is undervalued. It's wireless business should worth 10B(or more) and it's 20% stake in sk Hynix is valued at 15.4B. 
Shares should be 40$ to reflect that.
Spin-out catalyst could bring that value to shareholders.


 SKM has a 20% stake in SK Hynix which equates to nearly 2/3 of its market cap.
Which means it's wireless business is SUPER undervalued, or you can get super discounted exposure to SK Hynix. Either is bullish.

Rumors of spinning out the non-wireless businesses from SKM would bring that value to shareholders.

Insiders are buying more, not unloading. Which means insiders at SKM also like rocket emojis
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

 Risk and catalyst:
Spin offs could be unwelcome or difficult to achieve, keep the value discounted.
Catalyst: south Korea updated its fair trade act making spins offs easier to achieve.

Had to check a few times because I couldn't believe it. 
The 20% ownership of SK Hynix is supposedly valued at roughly 15.4ish Billion usd.
The entire market cap for SKM listed shows 15.75B usd. 

It seems pretty crazy to discount the wireless business they run to only 0.35B. it's probably worth at least 10B? 13B? Let's say 10 for discount sake. For the sake of being lazy, and you probably stopped reading already anyways, let's completely discount all their other retail businesses to 0 and ignore the deal with Microsoft they made for Xbox sales and streaming.

10B + 15.4 = 25.4B I think that will be reasonable for a market cap.

Skm share price would be somewhere near $40 if the wireless business and the 20% ownership of SK Hynix were not discounted.
üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Downside risk... Lost opportunity somewhere else. It's already discounted and the risk I see is the spin out not happening. 

Sideways price action would be the risk (unless you're thetagang)

I like this stock because it's undervalued.

"I Think I Found A Way To Predict Dips with NASDAQ PSX and FINRA Volume, Or Maybe I Really Am Autistic",698,li5vch,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li5vch/i_think_i_found_a_way_to_predict_dips_with_nasdaq/,317,1613142123.0,"Last night I looked into SNDL and started comparing activities across the various markets that I could find, two for NASDAQ and FINRA's off-exchanges volumes. I sort of expected the relative volumes to be comparable in ratio, but they're not.

No, in fact there is some SERIOUS delay in tracking when markets start to swell up in short volume. If you look at Figure 1 you can see that they don't really seem to follow each other at all most of the time.

Except, when the different market volumes DO start to overlap and follow each other, THAT is when we see the larger dips in stock prices for those days!

&#x200B;

Now if you look at Jan 27th and Feb 10th in Figure 1 you'll see that NASDAQ PSX short volume peaked high, and FINRA and NASDAQ Boston synced up and peaked the very next day.

[Figure 1: Jan28th and Feb 11th were the largest dips, and also when NASDAQ B and FINRA short volumes started to sync up! ](https://preview.redd.it/2dj8tyjpqzg61.png?width=569&format=png&auto=webp&s=99aba3f5759d0272c401877acdef93cfea37e73d)

Yes, it is really easy with hindsight 20/20 to say ""OH YEA IT WAS IN THE DATA RIGHT THERE"" but I noticed something from another ""penny stock"" and made the same plot for the different volumes in the market.

[Figure 2: Same plot for different stock, showing similar trends as SNDL.](https://preview.redd.it/f5a16zi7tzg61.png?width=657&format=png&auto=webp&s=d631425582fb2593c9041ecc90805bdd2e231861)

Here, we again see the THREE DIFFERENT MARKETS dont usually line up, but when THEY DO START TO SYNC, the price has the largest dips the next day!

So if this is correct, than it's possible to see dip the next day **IF the NASDAQ PSX ShortVolume and FINRA Short Volume begin to move together** towards a peak. We'll see tomorrow, but I think this will show a drop tomorrow of over 20%

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

* Using only 2 data points(stocks) I was able to draw a trendline!
* If different markets start to sync up in volumes, the next day seems to have the largest dips in share price.
* IF my shit analysis is correct, than Boaty Stock is going to crash by over 30% tomorrow, MAYBE

**Edit 1:** Added the links to where you can find the volume txt files, but I've been having issues with the FINRA site, have to clear the browser sometimes or it takes you to a login screen.

2) Down a lot on a stock? The question is would you buy more of that stock at that price. If the answer is yes hold, if no sell. 

2.5) find a stock that you think will perform better than your current investments? Sell a position and diversify

3) Recognise when a stock is dead. If everyone says it‚Äôs going up. It‚Äôs reached the top. 

4) Diversify retard. At the end of the day long-term options and shares are the best bet. Not fucking OTM weekly FDs

Here's the thing. Since the gme fiasco wsb has drawn a lot of attention from the hedge funds. So any time you tares talk about the next big push on a stock, the professionals are watching and will play you. 

Most of us that were originally part of this group used the forum as a means for learning and laughs.  Now it has become a zoo.

Many of us want to make some gains through good investments with a bit of gambles. But you fuckwads that have infested this subreddit have now drawn the attention of the major players in the market and want to take all the money you have.

Get out now,  this pump and dump scheme won't last long and you tards will find out the hard way that the house always wins.

You may have made a little money watching the market all day, but us real investors and real workers, don't have all day to look at a screen.

This fuckwad mob mentality is fucking up the market and other people's investments and livelihood. Stop trying to pump and dump. The HF can see and track your dimbasses before you can do anything about it.

Tesla is at almost $800 Billion, NIO is at around $100 Billion despite being much smaller than even Tesla.

My question is, when the dust settles, which won't be for at least a decade if not more, are EV companies going to be valued on average higher than traditional car companies are valued today? Will it depend on whether or not they also have a battery/energy play like Tesla?

Just wondering, is NIO overvalued, or does it represent where the market thinks EV companies should be valued?",2021-02-12 12:19:58

Why Yandex (YNDX) is poised for optimal growth and massive expansion,135,li2pnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li2pnz/why_yandex_yndx_is_poised_for_optimal_growth_and/,97,1613129756.0,"I'm going to cut to the chase because I know most of you are on the verge of bankruptcy at age 19 because you got in at $450 on GME and wondering why its not going to $1000 after you paper handed at $439 and sold.

&#x200B;

# What is Yandex?

Yandex is a multinational corporation that operates primarily in Russia, Europe and ex-Soviet bloc offering a wide range of services. Primarily their revenues are from being a search engine, taxi services and other segments. Currently they offer more than 70 services (Streaming subscriptions like Netflix, Yandex.Music like Spotify, Classifieds ads, self-managed subscriptions for ad campaigns, self driving cars, deliveries, marketplace and a fuck ton more)

&#x200B;

# But first, fundamentals.

This is to help you sleep better at night so you can worry more about your 35c 2/19 AMC calls you blew your money into.

I don't like re-inventing a lot of stuff so this is simply principles I've adopted from Grand-Daddy Graham

**Adequate size (sales no less than 700m)**

As you can see Yandex has been seeing consistent revenue growth since 2017. Recently, its delivery service has begun turning a profit and is widely used among the citizens of Russia.

Read that again. **A Taxi/food delivery service is turning a profit.** That is a big accomplishment. Have you seen Uber or DoorDash turn a profit?

Check the 2018 & 2019 numbers. Now, do you want to know something else? **They currently have enough cash (1.1b$) to cover all their current total liabilities or all their convertible (one or the other) at any time they need.**

In addition, they've repeated in their financial statements that the liquid cash they have **is enough to cover operating costs should the pandemic continue.**

This tells me they're not gonna lay down like a bitch and cry to daddy when a white swan curve ball is thrown at them (I'm looking at you airlines)

This is their free cash flow from previous 3 years and TTM. You always want to see a positive cash flow to ensure that companies have enough liquidity to stay afloat and keep them from issuing new shares to raise capital. Spikes in cash flow from growth companies is not uncommon, it is mainly due to usual acquisitions, restructuring, re-investments made. Current outstanding shares: \~345m

# Now, on to some of their services.

This is just a brief overview as their business model is pretty extensive and by this time you lovely bastards have already bought OTM calls expiring this weekend. (Don't yo, this is a long term play)

**Yandex.Lavka**

1. Grocery delivery within 5-12 min is the goal. Some sites are achieving this already
2. Takt time per grocery item bagged is 10s. Takt time is the amount of time it takes to complete one process.
3. Groceries are then transferred to drivers for delivery (think Amazon Prime Now)
4. In order to reduce costs, additional lavkas in high concentration areas will be built.
5. Not all but some Lavkas are kitchens where actual food is cooked
6. Yandex Rover is making deliveries (actively) in three different locations. Currently a test but with the goal of going 100% driverless for deliveries and reduce costs.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Market**

1. Their current primary growth segment. They've recently acquired Sberbank's stake (Russia's most influential and one of largest banks) and now own 100% of market. Their goal is to rival other marketplace and ecommerce companies such as [Ozon.ru](https://Ozon.ru)
2. They currently have fulfillment centers and are in the process of building additional ones. Does not want to store its own Yandex branded products but wants to become a pure marketplace that offers fulfillment services for sellers and makes it easier for customer (cliche, but think Amazon)

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Go**

1. Offers delivery services to residential and commercial customers (stuff ranging from documents to pianos)
2. More than 100k deliveries made per day on other customers orders
3. ""Delivery with a click"" which delivers the orders to nearby lavkas (think Amazon locker). Delivery goals are to be within 15 min.

&#x200B;

**Yandex.Cloud**

Not much to say here but theyre offering cloud services to companies. Main competition Amazon AWS

**Yandex.Maps**

Same as above. Main competitor Google Maps

**Alice**

Yandex's dedicated AI. Currently has 45+m users, mainly in speakers, navigation, Yandex App

**Yandex.Search**

Their actual search engine that makes up bulk of their revenues.

1. What I loved seeing in their recent financial statements is that **while search engine revenues kept increasing, their TAC (traffic acquisition costs, the cost Yandex pays for others to refer customers to them) is decreasing.** What does this mean? It means customers are going directly to Yandex instead of using a medium. **Think**, why the fuck unless you're a boomer would you go to google, search for 'amazon' when you can go to amazon directly? This is actually a legit problem Google faces as Amazon cuts down on their revenues by not allowing customers to see Google Ads.
2. TAC decreased nine months ended Sep 19 to Sep 20 by 16% while total ad revenues grew by 1%. Read that again god damn it. **They're paying 16% less while maintaining their ad revenues, their biggest segment!**

**Yandex Self Driving Group**

Yo. This shit. Is. Legit.

Let me tell you about the streets of fucking Moscow. Dirt, snow, murky (or none at all) traffic lanes, chaotic drivers, alleys tighter than your uncles anus when JNJ took another -1.5% hit on his portfolio. And they STILL managed to develop an autonomous driving vehicle that navigates through all that shit without user input.

They currently have logged over 5.5 million miles using autonomous driving in Tel Aviv, Michigan and Moscow. That is a big fucking deal. They also have a partnership with Hyundai.

**However**, coming straight from their engineers it will take several years before fully autonomous driving can EXCEED human driving. This means it will take several years for perfection, whos to say sales cant happen before that?

# Other stuff

They sponsor educational camps and programs that focus on hard sciences in Russia (Physics, mathematics, engineering) and they continue to choose talent from these areas. This lessens the reliance on foreign specialists from the US/Europe to develop their products

They focus heavily on customer service and truly understand their core audience. I am telling you, Russians (especially those born in Soviet era) is TOUGH to accept technology. And yet they've done it by Yandex.taxi and Yandex.Lavka .

I'm kinda of a gay bear for our stock market right now, I feel like we're running on fumes with the stimulus cash and might see some extreme volatility in short term in US stocks.

Institutions have loaded up on Yandex since late 2020. Don't ever take this as a tell-tale sign to buy, but rather as one part to consider

# Gay Bear cases (in this case I am also a gay bear)

Russia is not stable politically - things can be done under the table.

* True, fair risk. But more or less the same thing in US except it's official (lobbying, insider trading, congress hearings that are just a facade)

They're too over-extended in their segments. They're focusing on all at once instead of focusing on what they can do really well.

* I would be concerned about this if their cash flow, revenues and net incomes would be decreasing YoY. However their current trajectory is that theyre consistently increasing. Also, think about it more simply - if they have these specialists working on all these segments, they can easily sell them off for a profit. Yandex.Pay was a cashless payment system that was 100% sold off to Sberbank. It is something that Yandex created and then re-invested those proceedings to their different ventures like Yandex.Market

What else you got? I am legitimately interested as my overconfident ass has 50% of his portfolio in this.

To all my Peak Freak Apes - there is one major reason to not let out of your SNDL position just yet,169,li26ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li26ar/to_all_my_peak_freak_apes_there_is_one_major/,137,1613127981.0,"So the market corrected today. There has been a ton of press in the last 72 hours about how Sundial is an inflated stock and that no doubt had an effect on the market today. That, and, if we are being frank, the stock was probably a bit overvalued given the lack of DD that actually caused it rise.

But let's pause right there and take a minute to discuss value. Value, some may argue, is only held intrinsically. However, the reality is that value is always set by the buyer. The market is driven by market psychology. The point here is that no matter what reason SNDL gained over the last two weeks, the value was there. For those of us who bought and and have gains, and those of us who bought and are holding the bag right now -- the fact of the matter is for a period of time the value of this stock had increased. We ourselves saw the higher value in it, otherwise we wouldn't have bought it at the price we did, now would we have? Whether a rise in value is due to the company experiencing a catalyzing event, or because a bunch of retarded apes like flinging their own shit around, it doesn't really matter - the value went up.

Now, I only paused for that brief aside because I want to tell my fellow apes - stop being peak freaks. A day of correction isn't the end of the world. The fact of the matter is, this stock may have been overvalued at $4, but at under a dollar it was drastically undervalued given the ""money moves"" they have been making in the last 10 months.

Now, segue into the point of all this. Due to the rise in value over the last 9 days of SNDL, regardless of what caused that rise, SNDL has made it into the territory of becoming compliant. 9 consecutive days of over $1 and tomorrow is day 10. What does this mean? It means the stock, having been in jeopardy of being delisted from Nasdaq ever since it transferred to the exchange, lost investor interest. Now, with a 10 day consecutive period trading over $1, the stock will be no longer be in jeopardy of being delisted (at least for 90 more days). The Big takeaway here is this: SINCE $SNDL WAS LISTED ON NASDAQ, IT HAS \*NEVER\* REACHED THIS COMPLIANCE THRESHOLD. Since day 1 it has literally been fighting to stay on NASDAQ. Now, in all likelihood, it is going to get to stay. This will likely serve as a catalyst event to boost the stock short term.

I am not saying this stock is destined to go back to $4, but if you are down today and want to let your shares grow and then go for the profit take, the opportunity has not disappeared.

&#x200B;

TL;DR $SNDL gets NASDAQ compliance tomorrow and then we should anticipate a bump of some sort in the price due to the new-founded exposure.

Basically in the article is says there is a monopoly of a few players (Bayer, Corteva, ChemChina and BASF) controlling the entire agriculture sector and they decide for the farmers what tractor they should buy and they dictate the farmers what to grow and how. Supply chains are also very short and that means things could break very quickly, is this why we also see mass farmer protests around the world? I wonder about this because I see that stock price only going up and I am not sure why it does.

I am sick and tired of people saying weed stocks are a long term play, buy and hold in weed stocks especially the ones like SNDL will take your portfolio down to 99% in couple of months.   Even CGC has been down more than 60 percent from it's top before the pandemic even began.  If you cannot hold this stock and diamond hand's it for more than 6+ months then GTFO.

APHA holders who bought before pre legalization and never averaged down just went positive only for 1-2 days this week. They üíéüôå it for 3+ years.

Lot's of discord and slack pump and dump group's are involved where the runup a stock and then drop the price. These people do the charts in youtube.  If you are a normal investor who cannot spend the entire day day trading then you will loose your life savings.

Meme Stock Cycle,1022,li0yu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/li0yu5/meme_stock_cycle/,243,1613124042.0,"I've noticed newer people aren't sure how this works. I told someone yesterday that SNDL would dump today or Friday and they asked me ""what my thesis was"". There is no thesis. You nerds can't just go by numbers or info about the company. This is human behavior and computer algos programmed by humans.

So let me lay out what happened with SNDL (and most meme stocks for that matter)

Early Adopter Phase - This was when SNDL was under $0.5 recently. People who suspect the stock is undervalued and a lot of bigger money investors are loading up. The stock may trade relatively flat or go through small increases.

Middle Phase - 01/28: SNDL spikes up to 100%, before closing the day up about 39% at $0.83. Very high volume on the day. This is where people who are watching for activity get in (I bought here).

Late/FOMO Phase - 02/08: SNDL spikes roughly 14% and goes into a stage of parabolic gains as retail buyers rush in and FOMO takes hold. Word spreads like wildfire across social media and forums. Everybody is aware at this point.

\*Short sellers know how this works as well and they will enter positions at some point during this phase

Profit Taking Phase - After a few days of huge gains on very high volume, buying reaches a crescendo. The earliest adopters have already made several times their initial investment and are ready to cash out. The people who bought in the middle know that the ""smart money"" has either already sold or is about to sell. This leads to chain reaction of increased selling. Fear can take hold over the Late Adopters as they do not want to lose money and panic sell.

Set for next cycle - The stock usually drills hard, followed by some more selling and/or a dead cat bounce if the drop is too drastic. Over the next trading sessions, price will go through smaller up an down bounces until a new ""baseline price"" is found. The stock will usually trade sideways for a bit until the cycle begins anew. (This last part is hard to predict). Stocks may see very little activity for weeks or months in this phase, or buyers may quickly regain interest, especially if a catalyst appears.

Apparently big banks and institutions manipulate the price over a period of time to shake our retail investors while accumulating at a price they like without raising it too much with big single purchases

Death & Taxes

*I am not a financial advisor. Do not take this as investment advice. This is solely my opinion*

Ticker    $52.34    
Thesis

‚ÄúFuneral Home‚Äù & ‚Äúfuneral home near me‚Äù are trending & $SCI is the largest provider of funeral, cremation, and cemetery services.

Based on the Q4 Covid deaths and also an aging Boomer population, $SCI is well positioned for consistent growth for years to come. They are also poised for an excellent earnings report on Monday, 2/15‚Ä¶ Load up soon or you‚Äôll be left in the dust.

The search trends for funeral home are at all time highs on the 5 year chart. I will also provide a few snapshots from the earnings transcript where the SCI team is discussing the increased interest in Preneed cemetery plots. If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with this, it‚Äôs basically buying a cemetery plot before you need one. They‚Äôre typically financed over a 5 year term, but the revenue is instantly recognized.

The SCI team also pointed out on their last earnings call that their earnings were strong due to the unfortunate amounts of COVID deaths. This was during Q3 earnings, and you‚Äôll see in the chart below that there were massive increases in deaths during Q4 compared to Q3. The pandemic has instilled fear in many, and as deaths increase, the fear increases. This will likely result in increases in at need services and preneed bookings.

Many companies benefited from COVID from a financial perspective. $SCI is one that has seen a major boost in revenue‚Äôs from the pandemic, however they will not experience the some drop off. Death is an unfortunate thing, but will happen to us all. The aging Boomer population will continue to result in increased revenues for $SCI

CDC Deaths 2020 Vs 2019 https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/provisional-tables.htm

The CDC is a bit behind on reporting of deaths, however most interesting correlation I found is that April had a major uptick in % differential for deaths. This major uptick, and sustained differential from April to September can arguably be attributed to the pandemic. Both due to COVID deaths, and indirect deaths as a result of the pandemic.",2021-02-12 09:47:57

These are rather concerted efforts, and I didn‚Äôt put together the pieces until I saw CNBC pushing the ‚Äúfroth‚Äù narrative. The first dip happened at 10AM on Wednesday and the second happened 12:00PM on Thursday, February 11th. 

The criteria seems to be NASDAQ Composite over 14k, Dow over 31.5k. Whoever is doing this is using ridiculously broad market sell orders across hundreds, if not thousands, of securities at the same time. I don‚Äôt have a Bloomberg terminal, but I think they are trying to time the moment when the order book is either the most full, or most empty. If they are targeting the order books at the thinnest, that may be an attempt to cause a market crash. 

However, if they are targeting the thickest or just a moderately full order book, then this is probably the collective consciousness of old money trying to time the market, and it will pass when they hear cool heads like Tom Lee explain the facts.

The same is true of TDA.

Everyone does it at this point, so there's not much you can do about it. That said, I think everyone should know when they're the product and not the customer. If you primarily trade options in the US there is not a broker (that I'm aware of) that does not sell your order flow to someone like citadel.

My plan for maximum slow cooked chicken tendies,59,lhz4zt,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhz4zt/my_plan_for_maximum_slow_cooked_chicken_tendies/,76,1613118438.0,"Let's all take a second to look around. What's been happening here? Rockets here, rockets there. This whole fucking sub is filled with people throwing around their red rockets. Some of these rockets go up into the ethereal tendie heavens, but most go plunge straight into the markets gaping, mangy abyss.

Why do I mention rockets?

Enter ARKX. The rocket itself. The real deal rocket. For all you tards who haven't looked up from blowing bubbles in your cereal for the past 10 years, let me paint you a picture on what has been going on.

The future is here. We are in a god damned technological revolution. Most of all, we're in a new space race. ""Wait, you mean we're going back to blasting chimps into space then fingering their assholes when they get back, then telling the Reds to smell my finger?"" No. We're going to space to stay. And you what's going to happen up there? Industry.

NASA already estimates that wealth from mining minerals on asteroids is in the QUADRILLIONS. I call bullshit on that figure. The universe is infinite. Therefore there is infinite wealth up there. NASA's gonna go up there, and some cuck with a clipboard will be like, ""Yea, we lowballed that one."" 

[https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/05/13/the-race-to-mine-space/?sh=3ffe32041a70](https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/05/13/the-race-to-mine-space/?sh=3ffe32041a70)

I know, I know, all you dingleberrys that are stuck in the 80's, are thinking, ""NASA choked on Challenger's dick and died right there on the spot."" That's sure what it looked like. Well guess what. They're back, and they're now riding the coat tails of every fucking smooth-brained, money making messiah that you worship and make gainz off of. Did you look at the article that I linked? Probably not. I'll sum it up for you. Jeff Bezoz has his plans of going up there too, to do a little mining for himself. Look at his fucking head. Notice anything? IT'S SMOOTH AS EGGS. Draw your own conclusion on that one.

I don't really even need to touch on Papa Musk's plans. His mission is our mission. It's inherent at this point. You know everything that he touches turns into hard cash for you. Everytime you sit there trying to yank one out of your noodly, skinny pale trouser snake, you always have to, ""pour one out for Elon."" His target is to send 1 million people to Mars by 2050. 

[https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-plans-1-million-people-to-mars-by-2050-2020-1](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-plans-1-million-people-to-mars-by-2050-2020-1)

Do you think he's going to overpromise and underdeliver on that? Do you know what his kid's name is? This man is looking so far into the future, we don't even have language to express his kid's name.

Here's what's going to happen. In no more than 10 years time. More like 5 years. Captain Kirk will be on TV trying to sell you intergalactic travel packages at discounted rates. Of course you go. Your buddy, Chad, is stuck flipping burgers on some distant mining base, talking up all the dividends he's racking up bi-annually off his companies plan. You, on the other hand, have more nefarious plans in mind. Sure it's fun to hit Chad's bong on the dark side of some cold asteroid and talk about the old days, but you have better plans. You've got a date with a cheap alien lady-boy whore, parked on lovers lane overlooking the Eagle Nebula. All the while, you plan on going knuckles deep in any mucous filled orifice you can find. And that's on a THURSDAY.

So here's the skinny on ARKX. Listen up. For all the ass hats who don't know who Cathie Wood is, you will now. In 2018, Papa Musk was in a bit of a rut. He was losing faith in TSLA, and contemplating it's future, (I know, hard to believe). In fact, it was so bad, Elon was practically begging to suck Tim Apples ding-a-ling to get bought up. 

[https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-analysis-cathie-wood-ark-prediction-just-came-true-2021-1-1029944356](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/tesla-stock-analysis-cathie-wood-ark-prediction-just-came-true-2021-1-1029944356)

You know who was there by Papa Musk's side? That's right. Meet your new mommy, Momma Wood. She gave Papa Elon the best fucking prostate orgasm ever, and with that, the clarity that TSLA was going to propel him to Mars and beyond. So every time you're having wet dreams about sucking Elon's monster dong, you're eternally in debt to Mama Wood. But she doesn't fault you for not giving her credit. You know why that is? Because she is a Goddess. She's humble. She knows that at some point, one day, your eyes will be opened, and that you will recognize her for her past efforts, and for her future plans. ARKX. She knows that once you have this realization, you will be bent over, gallon jug of off-branded cooking fat in hand, ready to have her peg your stanky ingrown hair infested asshole. You will be BEGGING her, ""MoAR tHicC GaINz, PLEEZE!"" 

So what's play here. I love a good YOLO. I wake up every morning expecting to see gainz porn from all these rocket launches we've been having. For me, personally, I'm mildly autistic. You could say half-autistic. My wife and her boyfriend's children are all autistic. I want the YOLO gainz, but I also want to know where to put some of my gainz, as my wife, her boyfriend, and their children are all dependent on me for money. So I got to be smart, you see. As I see it, ARKX is a slow cooker for your tendies. There's nothing like making a cool, quick ten bagger on some FD's. That rush is unmatched. That feeling of having a greasy burger after munching on your boyfriends asshole for an hour straight. ARKX, on the other hand, is like few have thought to experience. Like fine aged wine or whiskey. Slow cooked, tender, melt in your melt tendies. 100x in the next ten years, conservatively, tendies. Set-it-and-forget-it tendies. They practically fall apart in your mouth. 

This DD doesn't even begin to touch the vastness of what's all in play with space exploration plays.

I don't know what's going to be in ARKX, or where it will begin trading at. I also don't know the exact date it will begin trading, I heard the last week of March at the latest. Keep an eye out. I'm sure you will hear when it does commence. For me, I already threw a bunch of stagnant savings I had in ARKF. Let me tell you what, I am not disappointed I did that. When ARKX comes out, my IRA will be converted to ARKX, but I will be keeping my boomer AAPL, and holy TSLA shares. I will be set. I have utmost confidence this will be the easiest, long term print around. 

Thank you for your time. I'm a half retard, not an investment advisor. 

TLDR: ARKX will print you space tendies for all your orifice fingering needs.",2021-02-12 08:27:18

We've become pimps for equities: prop 'em up to make them look pretty and sell them off to a troglodyte infested with STD's. We need to change the way we see stocks as a piece of a company that offers potentially good returns with a little bit of patience and gambling. Get-rich-quick schemes, as we have seen throughout the last 30 days can easily turn into get-broke-even-faster gambles that ruin your wallet and faith in the stock market.

You might've heard ""you want to invest in your future."" Take it seriously. Throwing 10-50 stacks at GameStop to fend off ""short ladder attacks"" or injecting steroids into a no-name Canadian weed company that rivals the market cap of Wendy's is pretty reckless, and you deserve to lose that money when it craters. INVEST LONG TERM BUT GAMBLE WITH THE MARKET. Make sounds decisions but make bets on market conditions to fulfill your cocaine addiction.

With that said, there's a great investment opportunity in SPG (Simon Property Group). Simon is an American commercial real estate company, one of the largest REITs, and the largest shopping mall operators in the US. They had a steep selloff in March of last year, but has seen a rise of 3100 basis point YTD (31%). They have more room to climb because of stock momentum, COVID vaccines, consumer demand, and a aggressive strategy to stay ahead of competition. Despite this, they're still bullish. During the Q4 call, they remain ""confident"" that the worse is behind them, and SPG is trading at a discount of $109 to its target price consensus of $125.

In 2020 with COVID ravaging the bottom line for a lot of companies, they pulled in some impressive numbers.

**Company Statistics Over the Last Year back from December 2020**

* generated over $2.3 billion in operating cash flow;
* acquired an 80% interest in The Taubman Realty Group who specialize in super-regional and outlet shopping malls in the United States and China (China is back in business, remember?) ;
* raised over $13 billion in the debt and equity markets
* opened two new international shopping destinations, expanded two others and completed three domestic redevelopments;
* returned more than $2 billion to shareholders in cash dividends paid (for comparison, even though they're not a REIT, Ford suspended dividends along with many other companies)
* Occupancy was 91.3% at December 31, 2020. (Doesn't even seem like COVID made a dent).
* Base minimum rent per square foot was $55.80 at December 31, 2020, an increase of 2.2% year-over-year.
* Extensive, permanent cost-cutting measures were implemented to reduce operating expenses and offset revenue decline. (Leaner businesses are best equipped for a rebound in profits)

**Chart Analysis**

They have historically been almost spot on with moving average analysis. Comparing their 50-day and 200-day moving average, they're currently on a bullish trend, positive upward momentum to a higher stock price. The short term moving average is above the long term line, thus indicating they're in for a good run in the near future.

**COVID Vaccines**

We know that the Biden administration is pushing for vaccinations. For good reason: once we're at herd immunity, states will be opening up because they're in need for revenue after incurring major expenses to keep their hospitals and small businesses staffed and opened during the height of the pandemic. Today we learned that the Biden administration is moving up their timeline to distribute vaccines after Pfizer and Moderna made a deal to provide 200 million shots. Once people are vaccinated to the threshold of herd immunity, the economy will start moving in the right direction. And, remember, Simon is trading a discount now. Once people feel more comfortable being around others, mall traffic can expect to increase.

**Summary**

I know some of you see the market as a casino. But, if you bet on America, you can never go wrong. Once sentiment changes, if it hasn't already curved in a better direction, businesses will attract the traffic. Maybe not pre-pandemic levels for some, but their stock price will rise as we get closer. SPG is primed for a return built on solid fundamentals (curse word in this sub?), an upward trend based on chart analysis, and growing confidence in our ability to be around others after much fatigue. Right now, betting on America is wagering if we can make a recovery. And when have we been unable to recover as a country?

Copper by all technical indicators has broken out and is in price discovery due to mines being shut down, historically low stockpiles, reopening demands, inevitable inflation, and an upcoming EV boom.

[Heres someone way smarter than this retard confirming my beliefs.](https://www.dailyfx.com/forex/technical/article/fx_technical_weekly/2021/02/10/copper-price-outlook-bullish-as-breakout-begins.html)

The past three days have been huge for copper, ending up with a net gain of almost 3.59% which for copper is pretty fucking big. 

Yesterday morning it was also upgraded to a buy by JPM. After starting the morning out +6% it dropped hard during that market wide dip. Now keep in mind FCX is not the hottest stock in the world so its volume is pretty low. I have no proof but given its low volume it would be extremely easy to manipulate downwards so you can load up. After speculating why this could be happening all day, it happened.

**AT CLOSE SOMEONE IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED 2.74 MILLION SHARES**

[Order book screenshot](https://ibb.co/tMKDwGD)

2.74M shares, 85 Million dollars worth.

While the rest of the market slowly recovered the rest of the day FCX continued to walk downwards and ended at -2.5% on a day where copper was +1.5%. Add in the day before where where it opened low and ended flat when copper had another 1.5%, and today again where copper ended up +.2% and FCX was for some reason down again at -.8%. Again keep in mind that FCX is super low volume so manipulating it would be expensive but easy.

The charts from FCX and the copper index ETF (CPER) generally mirror eachother and is pretty easily verifiable by looking at the charts. Well until recently that is, they both peaked on 1/14, the last time copper was at its recent high, the CPER etf is up 2.8% since then and for some extremely strange reason FCX is down 3.2%. That is a 6% deviation on genuine boomer metrics. As of today there were no massive buys AH but who inows whats going on in dark pools as my broker is showing its up AH on zero volume.

I know copper has been in an epic run but factor in the upcoming EV boom with looming inflation and a supply shortage and copper is most likely poised to shoot past all time highs with supply at historic lows and demand soon to be at an all time high. Feel free to look at the FCX all time chart to see how parabolic runs are a frequent thing in their history and we may be entering one.

*********************** 
**RECAP**

Breif history of CRSR, the stock blew up post IPO from $17, riding epic gaming industry performance throughout the pandemic.  It hit a high above $51 in Sept '20 before correcting and trading between $41 and $36. The float is low so swings are volatile. Also lots of short volume bla bla

**1/13** - a little stock called G M E more than doubled in a day causing to CRSR tank to $36 with some momentum. Possibly a direct result of liquidation in reaction to the squeeze (maybe retail and/or institutional....Citadel is 2% owner of CRSR float)... or maybe just normal volatility fluctuation by the puppet masters, who knows?

Cool, so now the stock is oversold with puny market cap. It starts climbing back to the average peak levels, then ...

**1/27** - CRSR announces a secondary PO of 7.5 million shares...it hits a high of $49, before a 2 day selloff.  Crash Boogaloo.

After the selloff it picks up momentum running up to the 2/9 earnings report, with expectations of excellent numbers. IV is through the roof. Debate kicks off whether earnings are already priced in and an IV crush was inevitable.

**2/9**  -  **CRSR delivers an amazing earnings report.** EPS beats estimates, $1.7B revenue for the year, profit margins way up, debt is down, and they said THEY HAVE SO MUCH DEMAND THEY CAN BARELY KEEP UP WITH IT. The only thing that kept them from possibly crossing $2B was semiconductor supply shortages (which every other tech company is dealing with too).

 After this amazing ER, the stock tops out at about $48 premarket....before nosediving, nearly hitting $40. 

Now many were saying that the runup to the ER was all just hype, so of course it tanked post ER like LOGI AMD and all the rest. 

But looking at what actually happned, it wasn't actually just hype. The pre-ER runup was almost all attributable to upward correction from the previous 2 selloffs.  The only reason it crashed was because other companies crashed post earnings in 2021, so paper hands sold in expectation of the IV crush...sell limits were triggered, self-fulfilling prophecy.   

So the price starts to fall into oversold territory. Quote from Barron's ""Of the 11 analysts that cover the stock 10 rate it a Buy, and one has a Hold rating on the name."" Literally almost everyone thinks this thing is a bull. Price is already starting to completely recover by Close on 2/9

But then yesterday some genius at Goldman decides to downgrade the stock to ""Neutral"" from ""Buy"", causing the selloff to dip even lower, hitting just above $40. Their justification? They think gaming demand could wane in 2021, and also are worried about the fact that CRSR hasn't been able to meet 100% of demand due to shortages of chimps. (ha!)

**************************************************************************
**CURRENT SITUATION**

That brings us to today. CRSR is way oversold. $1.7B profitable revenue...yet $3.9B market cap for a fast-growth tech company? pitiful. Almost every analyst, including Goldman, has increased their price targets, many above $50. 

Compare that to LOGI..$2.9B revenue ($4.4B+ TTM), at $19.9B market cap and climbing fast.  Speaking of LOGI, check out this [chart](https://imgur.com/3ORH329). **1/19 Post-Earnings dip, before running to ATH 2 weeks later.** 

But CRSR price is still down, why my neuro-atypical friends?

Maybe has to do with the fact that the daily short volume has been above 50% every day? http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html 

Or maybe a bunch of boomer bears actually think the gaming industry will really pull back (we've already seen this isn't going to happen anytime soon.)

But pressure is easing, as of 1/29, short interest dropped 44% from the previous report. And daily short volume dipped below 50% yesterday for the first time in months (this isn't a squeeze play, this means that short downward pressure is backing off).  IVs starting to return to earth.

And what also happened today? The P OTUS just [announced](https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order) by executive order they're launching an initiative to ease the semiconductor shortage as a top priority. Exactly the thing holding back CRSR from meeting full demand, and one of the factors leading to Goldman downgrade.  

The gaming industry is not magically going to drop from the sky as soon as the the pandemic eases. We all know new players get hooked, and there are tens of millions of them since last year. The more they game the more they‚Äôll be looking to buy new gear. They will continue to game even if they start traveling or going to restaurants more. 

They also currently have a big stake in the streaming market, which 1000% isn't going away

Without the shortages, there's nothing holding this company back from achieving full earnings potential. 

With the rest of the rockstar fundamentals, this is a $65-$70 stock EASY. You will not beat this entry point. 

Very minimal risk with a shares play on this at the very least. 

**TL;DR** RGB = Buy. Get on the üöÄ. You‚Äôll thank me in a month. 

Or don‚Äôt listen to me because that 60 pack was just breakfast. DYOR

**Clarification for all the recently acquired WSB dipshits confused how a stock could be good without 200% short interest and near bankruptcy fundamentals, this isn't a squeeze play...short pressure is backing off because they know it has actual legs.**",2021-02-12 08:14:52
GME historical survey of the systemic problem of shorting non-existing stock (naked shorting) in relation to recent events,506,lhyumr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhyumr/gme_historical_survey_of_the_systemic_problem_of/,96,1613117541.0,"Full disclosure, stolen from r/options.

A Case story of Naked Shorting in GME
TLDR:¬†Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)
I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:
One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs (https://wherearetheshares.com/). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example:¬†/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here¬†/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.
I‚Äôm an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this¬†https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm. ‚ÄúFailures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period.¬†A fail may also result from ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling.‚Äù
Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.
According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, ‚ÄúAbusive¬†naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price¬†to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about¬†persistent failures to deliver in the market¬†for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago‚Ä¶ Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and¬†intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws‚Ä¶ We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that¬†substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.¬†Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover,¬†they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price. (Source:¬†https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm)
In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But¬†when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market ‚Äì it is undermining it.‚Äù¬†Mr Cox also ‚Äúreferred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales‚Äù as ‚Äúa tool to drive down a company's stock price"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to¬†loopholes in Regulation SHO"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote¬†/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) (source for SEC Chairman‚Äôs words:¬†https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm)
As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that¬†naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted¬†https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html¬†but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008¬†https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm)
I also read ‚ÄòOne complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares¬†for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and¬†artificially depressing the share price‚Äô‚Äù. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:¬†https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle)
All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.
On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.
Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars (https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.
Then I read something that caught my eye‚Ä¶ DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, ‚ÄúDepository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another.¬†These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices.‚Äù (Source:¬†https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)
Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal ‚ÄúThere is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.‚Äù (Source:¬†https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720).
""It has been alleged in¬†tens or hundreds of lawsuits that the DTCC and its¬†Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting¬†that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and¬†have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading. (Source:¬†https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/)
As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn‚Äôt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn‚Äôt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/29 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would‚Äôve happened that day.
From the Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúThe Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But¬†some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough‚Ä¶ Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say.¬†This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply‚Ä¶ Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.‚Äù¬†(source:¬†https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)
From everything I‚Äôve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/29 reported by S3 to be 122%¬†https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314

GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs (/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/) and using those to ‚Äúcover‚Äù their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close

As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float

The counterfeit shares can/have been used in¬†aggressive naked short attacks¬†to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to¬†artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares

Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may‚Äôve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME

There was potentially collusion on 1/29 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

Also, a¬†compelling theory¬†put forth by someone on what the 800 dollar calls were for and how they could be used to cancel out naked shorts includes data/graphs, recommend giving it a read",2021-02-12 08:12:21

Do we have the power to move the stock market or not? Just 2 weeks ago the overwhelming sentiment was ""this is the hedge funds game, we're just trying to catch a ride. Individual retail investors can't do shit to move markets. We're hyennas picking at Zebra carcasses, but sooner or later the Lions are going to come back and reclaim their feast."" 

Now it's a complete 180. I'm seeing tons of outrage from people who got burnt today on their weed calls. Acting like this lot of new degenerates came in and pumped the price before bailing, thus crushing the overall market. 20% gains for them cost you tens of thousands on your call options. Well, how much blame does the media get? 8 million people in this sub is a lot, but how many people does CNBC, Fox Business, The Wall Street Journal, Market Watch, The New York Times, etc. Reach? When they all band together and spend 2-3 full trading days only talking about ""the new Wall Street Bets move"", how many day traders come running? Just Google ""Wall Street Bets weed"" to see what I'm talking about.

We're either being played, or it's actually us having this big of an impact on the market. I don't know the answer. So let's look at both scenarios. 

**We control the market**

This is dope! We can work with this, and grow into it, but first I want to get something off my chest. FUCK YOU! Talkin bout ""degenerates ruining my weed plays"". Bitch, what have you been chortling about with GME this whole time? ""üíéüñêü¶ç Gang got greedy and forgot to hedge profits."" 
""I took my gains at 300 like a pro."" 
""It's so funny how the smooth brains got left holding the bag."" 
Preaching about holding the line in January while you turned 100 @ $5 into 15 @ $50, then switched to pissing on ""bag holders"" for ""getting played"" in February. 

If we truly have the power to move markets, then the $10's of millions in profits everyone took is what brought down the rising market caps. It also bailed out the shorts who were/are less than halfway done covering (TLRY has high SI too). Then we went and did the exact same thing with weed stocks. Don't hate the player, hate the game right? Ultimately, something tells me stocks don't move up when everyone is trying to play with house money. Definitely can't ""hold any lines"" with house money either. We should invest in stocks we care about for their long term potential; any squeezes or pumps that potentially come out of that are just an added benefit.

**We don't have the power to move markets** 

That's cool. We're still getting blamed for it, though. Not just from salty weed ""bag holders"" in here, but from all of the media. We got blamed for this meteoric rise, and within 20 minutes of the tank in pre-market CNBC was already pointing the finger at us. Weed Stocks have been on the rise for 3 months, if you guys were just riding a wave none of us ""retail traders"" have any control over, then what crashed it? I won't speculate on that because it falls under ""conspiracy bullshit"" but we should discuss it. I posted [this thread this morning](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhm0wz/were_weed_stocks_and_silver_pumped_by_hfs_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) claiming it was a diversion attempt away from GME, and urged people to ""cash out their gains before it crashes."" I wrote it before the price tanked. The mods deleted it, and rightfully so. I don't have any evidence to back up that theory. What I'm trying to say now isn't about GME either. 

However, if we don't actually have any control over the stock market we should be using the media manipulation to make fat gains before we get fucked by big time day traders and algorithm options trading. As soon as they dump a trend on us, we should dump that trend. If the price follows immediately, we'll know we actually have control of these markets, if it doesn't we'll know we're getting played and figure out why. What do you guys think? Quit ""REEEEE""-ing all over the place and let's figure this shit out!!

The memes on here use to be hilarious, uncensored, offensive and some of the worst advice you could possibly imagine. The thing is people understood the humor. Most understood market fundamentals and traded options. If you trade options you're a big brain mf, congrats and fuck you.

But new people reposting these shitpost memes everywhere, on every social media channel, comment thread, where ever, you're kinda fucking it up imo.

There was a massive difference between sharing personal investment/yolo stories to a group of 10-900K people and trying to hype up specific stocks to 8.9 MILLION or more random folks.

Ever since GME, WSB has become famous. So famous that [an ETF is being developed that will track trending stocks on social media like WSB.](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/vaneck-social-sentiment-etf-target-social-media-reddit-meme-stocks-2021-2-1030056054) People with money are going to take advantage of this easily influenced massive group of retail traders for their own gain if they haven't already.

&#x200B;

So what is the message here?

You should know the difference between investing and gambling, between GME and any other stock. Memes for GME do NOT apply to EVERY OTHER STOCK when it falls or when you're holding. The memes were fun but they really ONLY APPLIED to the GME situation.

If you want to invest please please please spend some time getting a basic understanding of volatility, risk management, trend patterns. Read the analysis behind companies before you invest. This is probably the ONLY time where ""Do your own research"" ACTUALLY BENEFITS YOU.

And always remembers that if you're gambling to rapidly make gains, you can just as suddenly lose your money.

Enjoy the memes, just don't bet on them.

The deal that was struck dolled out about 190B to shore up their balance sheets and the government got senior preferred shares at 10%, plus warrants for 80% of the companies. Other parts of the agreement forced payments equaling the entire market cap of each *quarterly*. This was completely untenable, and they had to borrow more money just to pay it, so that was nixed. Instead, amendment 3 was put into effect. This capped the capital each could hold at 3B and *all* profits go to the US treasury.

People say if you need to sell then sell.  NO! IF YOURE DUMB WITH YOUR MONEY LISTEN TO THE SMART PEOPLE.  Hedge funds and stupid people with money vs normal brains= end of free market.

GME long. DFV had it right on the fundamentals in market context and still has it right.,6424,lhvzuq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhvzuq/gme_long_dfv_had_it_right_on_the_fundamentals_in/,1244,1613109629.0,"**Listen up Retards, I have no idea idea what I'm talking about, but you should stop panic selling and get back in GME, HODL, and DO NOT LOOK at your balance for the next six months.** 

I'm late to GME and bought into the hype. Every day I've been tracking GME and got really close to selling, but before I sold, I decided study u/deepfuckingvalue activity for insights into why GME. I found a comment about that locked me in and want to discuss with you retards.

The news screams at us that the market is over valued. Time and time again a company has $40bn market cap on a measly $2bn revenue with $500mm profits. Who in their right minds would say a company is worth $40bn when it would take 80 years to see ROI. OVER VALUED TRASH. Even UBER report billions in losses but institutional investors are still riding a wave on overvalued trash, why shouldn't we do the same? 

GME is a good buy compared to loads of other OVER VALUED trash on the market. 

>People talk up the demise of GameStop yet here they are about to generate over $2b in revs in a single quarter at the tail end of a console cycle. - u/deepfuckingvalue 

$2bn in revenue in a quarter is not bad. In 2020, GME had revenues of $6.5bn with $300mm in losses down from $8.3 revenue with $491mm in losses in 2019--their worst year since each year before they were turning a profit. Amid a global pandemic GME manages to hold onto revenue and contain losses, they even came close to a profit in Q420 with only $20mm in losses down from $84mm in Q419--amid a global pandemic with Q420 ending in October and not including holiday sales.

Look at UBER and SNAP. In 2020, UBER had $14.15bn in revenue AND $8.6 BILLION IN LOSSES yet currently $113bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. Or SNAP. In 2020 it had $2.5bn in revenue, $945mm in losses and currently has $94bn market cap. OVER VALUED TRASH WITH HUGE LOSSES. 

If GME is over valued trash like these smart buys then it must be valued at $100bn, maybe $50bn. But wait, GME market cap rests at a modest $3.4bn. WTF?? So you mean to say GME's revenues are 2x its stock market value while closing in on losses but UBER and SNAP are killer buys with $100bn market cap with no end to their bleeding $$. THE EXPERTS SAY ITS BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL!!!

>The ‚Äúshift to digital‚Äù thesis is way overblown. - u/deepfuckingvalue

The financial news screams at us saying digital has killed brick in mortar, blah blah blah, we live inside computers now--see PROOF we are on WSB ALL DAY!! If brick and mortar were dead then why would Amazon purchase Whole Foods? Why do companies like PELOTON have retail stores ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY? Why did e-commerce sales only represent 11% of all retail sales in the US in 2019? BECAUSE THE SHIFT TO DIGITAL IS WAY OVERBLOW BULLSHIT THEY FEED US.

GME has losses, sure, but they are containing costs with revenue exceeds their entire stock market value. GME is bringing in loads of $$ and their nearly contained losses are way under leading trash-buy stocks like UBER and SNAP. Brick and mortar is alive even in a pandemic--just wait until after the pandemic. People like to visit shops and get their buy on quickly--that's why AMZ bought Whole Foods and online retail only represents a fraction of brick and mortar retail sales. GME is not going anywhere anytime soon. GME is undervalued compared to the rest of the trash on the overvalued market. That's why I'm holding, will stop looking at the ticker price, and will no longer join in discussion about GME on WSB.

PLTR DD - Earnings Play - Why This time is Different,260,lhtkgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhtkgb/pltr_dd_earnings_play_why_this_time_is_different/,169,1613103267.0,"\*not financial advice.

PLTR is an amazing opportunity rn. I did a DD on here for Nio when it was around  $39. Today was a bad day and we're still over 60. It doesn't make me more credible per se, but hear me out. 

I'm a catalyst trader. I go in before huge events. PLTR has an upcoming catalyst, and a compelling reason for the stonk price to be super high in the lead up to earnings.

**Catalyst:** PLTR's earnings is scheduled before market on Tuesday, 16th. 

**I. What happened before?**   
1) On November 12, PLTR's Q3 earnings was a whopping +125% surprise. Stonk prices skyrocked in the following weeks.   


2) On January 26, PLTR had a Live Demo Day. The stonk prices went from 26 to 39 leading up to Demo day, and then all the way up to 45 after Demo Day.   


**Thesis:** PLTR's scheduled events tend to pump the stonk prices in the build up and in the aftermath as well.  


**II. Earnings are volatile. Why play this one?**   
**A) Incentives:**  
PLTR's share lockout expiration happens days after earnings. Better earnings, equals better stonk prices, equals a better payout for those with the stock options. It's much more logical to pump the price up (legally through enthusiasm, etc) because the expiration will tank the price anyway, even if it's the bottom. 

I was offered share options from a startup once and understand the psychology of how this works. Imagine waiting for years to have your shares worth something, secondly, imagine owning tens-of-thousands of shares that you could just sell and become an overnight millionaire. If you never had a million dollars before, you wouldn't really care about timing the sale tbh, unless you're DFV (I don't think he works for PLTR). So the lockout expiration will very likely lead to a temporary selloff.  


**B) IV**  
The IV for PLTR is high. If you buy calls, buy leaps. I'm buying calls because I'm an autist. But if you wanna play it safe, do something else. Like play iron condor. Or just sell puts. Or ignore IV, buy shares, sell calls at the top. You'll have to time the top during/after earnings, but sell before the IV Crush. You could literally go about this in so many different ways and still make money.   


**C) Solid Performance and Partnerships**  
IBM, Rio Tinto, Cathie Wood's addition of shares, Blackrock's increase of shares, and a potential Facebook partnership. To be honest, the FB partnership rumor is probably fake, but, there was promise of another announcement near earnings. 

**TLDR -** I don't normally play earnings, but PLTR seems like a great play rn with many different opportunities.   
I apologize if I'm wrong about an earnings beat. I'm not a psychic. But I believe in the long term--this guy's going to 100+. So buy leaps and shares.",2021-02-12 04:14:27

According to a Businesswire Article ([link](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005267/en/)): ""A year ago, Roxgold announced the discovery of the Boussoura Project and has since drilled over 150 holes with consistent assay returns demonstrating broad intersections of mineralization with lower grade halos surrounding higher grade quartz veins ‚Äì characteristic of the style of mineralization found within the prolific Hound√© Gold Belt. The Boussoura Project is still in its early days, yet we are growing more confident in the scale of this project, with a large land package host to numerous veined corridors running over extensive strike lengths and with numerous targets identified between Fofora and Galgouli with similar geochemistry and geophysical anomalies. We will continue to keep the drills turning at Boussoura, as we look to continue to expand and define the mineralized footprint towards the goal of a maiden resource by year end.""

I had my friend (in the geology field) to look over their assay results and he's let me know that they are fairly significant.  


You may be concerned about mining in Africa, especially a country like BF. This is a valid concern, governments have not always been favorable to mining in Africa. It seems however, that BF has switched gears and is starting to move in a positive direction, the country has even eliminated a 10% tax on mining operations.

Deepest Value Stock Near Book Value Rdy for a Squeeze ($UWMC),104,lhvcol,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhvcol/deepest_value_stock_near_book_value_rdy_for_a/,141,1613107877.0,"First off, the obligatory, I used to be a financial analyst, but this is not financial advice and you should do your own DD.


Like my hero DFV, my bread and butter is to invest in extremely undervalued value companies in this frothy market environment with vix spikes happening every few days. If you follow DFV and watch his vids, you'll know that he bought GME for its value, and the gamma/short squeeze was icing.


This might be a long post, so skip to TLDR if you don't care about market logic. To begin, why is the #1 wholesale & purchase mortgage lender in USA so cheap you might ask? Well, I can't give you any one particular reason, but GHIV was one of the biggest spacs merger ever, and it might have suffered from the a spac speculative life cycle, and the shorts are in control, and oh boy, are they in control. Money these days have been flowing from GME/AMC and the like to weed, looking for whatever the next trend is--Twitter or not (yes, Zack Morris and the Atlas crew also love UWMC, and their cost basis is a lot higher than today's price).


It is borderline shameful how low this stock is, I mean I like me some FUTU and SNDL too, but I'd have to make it a point to check futures along w/ my midnight pee sessions if I were to dump my entire portfolio in those names. This thing has a **tangible book value of $7.75/sh**, that means if the company's financials were horrible, and they made no money, and decided to declare bankruptcy, and after they liquidate all their assets to satisfy their debt, shareholders will get back $7.75/sh. But no, their financials and balance sheet are immaculate, and they absolutely smashed earnings, originating 54.7B in loan volume, up 71% y/y, with a 4th qtr net income of  $1.37B vs. 108.72M (that's billion vs. million) in the same qtr last year,  and FY20 net income of  $3.38B, an **821%** and **715%** increase over 4Q19 and FY19, respectively.


Also, during the earnings call, they declared a dividend of $.40/yr, as of today's price, this is a **4.5% div. yield** with ex. div date on 3/9. Their EBITDA growth has outpaced their top line revenue growth, which signifies a margin expansion. They are getting more profitable every year, with good guidance on their call. Their forward P/E was 6.21 this morning, compared to that of RKT at $10.94. UWMC should be at a good value of around **$16.5** if we use RKT as a fair comp, although I would argue that RKT is slightly undervalued as well.


**Short Interest:**

As of yesterday, it had a short interest of **36.2%** with only 50k shares available to short at a 7.9% fee. When I tried to short 1 share on IBKR this morning, there were none available. I don't normally pick stocks based on short interest, but like DFV, this is an added icing for a major squeeze. It also has a short ratio of about 1.6, so it'll take at least 1.6 days for shorts to cover if there is a day of pure buys. The higher the ratio means more covering with higher volume spikes, which brings in more buyers.

https://www.algowins.com/ search for uwmc

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC


**Gamma Strip:**

The option flow on this is absolutely bonkers with 45k calls and 2k puts, there are gargantuan gamma ramps at 10, 12.5, 15, and 17, with $15 being the largest at every expiry. Once volume picks up and people realize how undervalued this stock is, it will quickly ramp to 15 via MM's delta hedging.


**Ownership:**

This is 34% instutionally owned with Phoenix Holding buying 2.5M shares today, making them 5.88% owners of the company. After today's buy, I would expect that institutionally owned number to reach 40%.


**Max Pain:**

I posted a DD on PCG a while ago and I rode it up from $8.50 to $13, so I understand how these stocks are artificially suppressed. PCG had a larger institutional ownership at around 80%, and it was curious to me how every opex date ended right around max pain. So even if that were the case here, max pain is at $10 on Feb 19, with the next lower strike ($7.5) losing 184.72% of contract value vs the next higher strike ($12.5) losing only 59.839%. I am fairly confident this will be above $10 by then.

**TA:**

UWMC is at the bottom of a channel with a lot of support from hfs buying anything below today. It is trading very near their book/NAV, and I think today's Phoenix 2.5m, a new 5.88% position will get some eyes on this gem. I have no doubt it will run up for ex-div date as well. There is bullish divergence and I see volume coming in the next few days. My personal price target is at $25-$30 within a year, and this constitutes as a long term hold for me.


**Tech:**
One of the things I like the most is their mobile app that gives independent brokers the ability to underwrite a loan from open to close, their companion app can pull credit reports, get e-sigs, and act as a point of sale and loan origination system. If they make it user assessible to retail clients, like how they do it in Asia with BEKE, I can see a big bottom-line bonus here.


**TLDR:**

**Heavily shorted, highly undervalued, hf darling with a book/sh of $7.74 trading at a forward p/e of only 6.21. My position: Breaking my rule of 2-5% allocation per ticker; 60% of my portfolio in shares @ 9.70s average; 10, 12.5, 15 calls.**",2021-02-12 05:31:17

We all know we're in a current market shortage of semiconductors. You can see this in the retail markets with GPU and CPU shortages, but we also have a shortage in the industrial sectors too. Our modern economy is rife with robots and computers everywhere from factories to your living room. All of those electronics need semiconductors and chips. 

$ON makes Memory, they make audio processors, they make LCD drivers, they make switches, sim card readers, thermal sensors, light readers, motor drivers, DC regulator, and USB controllers. [They make all the shit that makes robots work,](https://www.onsemi.com/products) and they make custom solutions too. 

We all know that robots are taking over our jobs, and that robots have been storming manufacturing for the last decade. Now $ON sits on a huge demand for these parts because the other companies like MU and TSM are spending all their resources trying to meet the big GPU and CPU demands. 

Other manufacturing is getting left behind in the semiconductor shortage. We still need automotive robot arms to build new cars, whether they're green or gas. We still need logic and power solutions for every manufacturing or appliance part that needs to move. That means assembly line robots, it means motor controls for cnc machines and shop equipment, it means the power solution for your oven and microwave, it even means the GFCI controller that stops you from ending it all after you lost it on GME when you tried to bathe with the toaster, which uses a power switch, which are made by $ON. 

But don't take my word for it. Look at it's charts.

This thing is primed to go, and already creeping up steadily on the fundamentals. It's already a mainstream company in the manufacturing world, a big name.

Position ‚Äì 16c , 3/19 and 24c 3/19 and 2k shares. I got into the stocks couple of weeks back when it was at $16

Now that is out of the way, lets get to it.

**What do you look for in a great DD:**

1. Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment
2. Financials are solid
3. Outlook is great
4. Company is a bit of an unknown and undervalued
5. There is an upcoming catalyst

Before I get into each, let me simply tell you what AMKR does. The company provides testing and packaging services to semi-conductor companies. So it works with companies that need to develop chips for your 5G phones, for your future EV Lambos. Basically it provides critical services to companies that manufacture or deal in semi conductors. The company is based in the USA and has big players like Qualcomm, Sony, AMD etc as its customers.

So now lets get to it:

&#x200B;

1. ***Company is in a growing space that is hot at the moment.***

Unless you have been hiding under the rock, semi-conductors are hot at the moment. There are multiple catalysts, from 5G phones roll out, to the EV wave, to more cloud computing, everything needs processing power. This means more demand for semi-conductors, in fact there is already a significant shortage being seen across the board. This is a hot sector to be in the moment. Don‚Äôt believe me here you go:

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html)

[https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef](https://www.ft.com/content/6caf7028-cae1-44f3-9bc2-7dc2d47a23ef)

Everything in this sector is running at full capacity. More production means more testing and packaging and this shit is not going to slow down anytime soon.

&#x200B;

***2.*** ***Financials are solid***

I can more with you all the details in the world, on how the company is constantly reducing it‚Äôs debt and increasing operating income or how it recently announced it is going to start giving dividends, but I am going to focus on one metric. P/E ratio.

While I was typing up this DD the P/E ratio of this company is 15.91. So is that good or bad, well to put it in context, Apple is 36.57 and Microsoft is is 36.35. Even your boomer stock PepsiCo is at 26.7.

Okay, but what about other companies in this space. TSM the biggest player in this space is at 62.17. Another favourite of this reddit, UMC 78.63, QCOM 24.81. AMAT, probably the closest to their business 28.79

Like I said, that metric alone tell you how criminally undervalued this company is.  Even a P/E ratio of 25, which would put it in the low end of the range, would shoot its price past $30

&#x200B;

***3. Outlook is great:***

Well, I am not going to say much, but just copy paste the closing statement from the last earnings call:

‚ÄúOkay. Well, thank you very much. Before closing the call, I would like to recap a few key messages. 2020 was a remarkable year for Amkor. We generated over $5 billion in revenue and $1.40 per share, and initiate cash dividend program for our stockholders. We accomplished this while navigating through a challenging global pandemic. We are expecting the first quarter of 2021 to be another solid quarter with revenue of $1.32 billion at the mid-point of our guidance.

2021 is expected to be another growth year for Amkor. Semiconductor market forecasts predict growth of around 9% for the year. With Amkor‚Äôs position in key growth markets, we expect to outgrow the semi-market forecast in 2021‚Äù

UMC has a revenue of $5bn and a valuation of $25B which is 4X of this company!AMAT as 3.5 times the revenue and 20X the valuation

Also to recap their 2020 highlights

Full Year 2020 Highlights:

Net sales $5.05 billion, up 24.6% year on yearNet income $338 million, earnings per diluted share $1.40EBITDA $960 millionNet cash from operations $770 million and free cash flow $221 million

Sixth consecutive year of positive free cash flow

Financial information on the company:

[https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302](https://ir.amkor.com/static-files/4052c2a2-2944-4563-88b2-6a6c928ae302)

&#x200B;

***4. Company is bit of an unknown and undervalued***

I mean, come on, everyone talks about TSM, AMAT, UMC, but has anyone every mentioned this company? It is literally the definition of an unknown.

Undervalued, it is CRIMINALLY undervalued compared to it peers. Look at the P/E ratio, literally better than anyone else. Its revenue to valuation ratio, literally better than anyone else. I mean I don‚Äôt know what else to say. This speaks BUY BUY BUY!

I mean, this company should have a valuation of at least $10B, which would shoot its price past $40

&#x200B;

*5.* ***There is upcoming catalyst***

Well company just become a strong buy on Zacks, but there is a bigger catalyst coming up on Feb 16th, which is the reason for some price action today:

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amkor-technology-set-join-p-232600920.html)

**The company is going to join the S&P Mid Cap 400 on Feb 16th.** This is probably the reason why the stock moved so much today.

This alone will bring more capital into the company. More and more people will look into this company and realize the absurd valuation compared to its peers and yes this rill rise more. Today was just the start of what might happen over the next week

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Yes I know the stock has doubled in the last 6 months and jumped 20% today, but

1. The outlook is better than ever in company‚Äôs history
2. They delivered their best ever quarter and will even pay dividends
3. The financial ratios are best in class, even better than all your boomer stocks
4. Based on the revenue and ratios alone the company should be valued at least 2X what it is today
5. Company is in the super hot semi-conductor space
6. There is an upcoming catalyst on Feb 16th - S&P 400 Mid-Cap inclusion
7. Another stock being mentioned here ON has the same revenue and income and is valued 3X more. if you think that is  a great play, which it is, think about this one!
8. The volume is lowish, but again I see that as a positive as this will climb quickly once there is interest. The avg volume on this stock is 1M, it was 5M today and already 700k after hours

I am balls deep on 24c, 3/19, which was looking risky two days ago, but it looks juicy as fuck now.

As always do your DD, and enjoy the tendies!

PSA: Don‚Äôt throw good money after bad,437,lhv3cx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhv3cx/psa_dont_throw_good_money_after_bad/,170,1613107217.0,"To all novice investors now frequenting this sub, here‚Äôs some helpful advice. It‚Äôs a trap to continue investing in your losing positions. If you‚Äôre a bagholder, the way out is not to funnel more funds into a sinking stock, averaging down. The better strategy is to invest in other stocks with clear upward momentum and trends. Use gains to offset your losses. Diversify your portfolio for better results.

It sucks being a bag holder. I know the feeling. I owned CCL for the dividend before Covid. Then the pandemic crushed the cruise lines and my position. Suddenly I was down 70% on the stock. But I did not invest another dollar into CCL since the health crisis began. Instead of averaging down, I put that money to better use in stocks that could benefit from the pandemic and economic recovery. Subsequently, I‚Äôve enjoyed an incredible past year, making a ton of money while leaving my CCL loss in the rearview mirror. 

Throwing good money after bad is a self-defeating move. Remember: the point of investing is to *make money* ‚Äî not gradually lose more and more of it in a position that‚Äôs clearly shrinking in value. Invest in winners, not losers.

This is not professional financial advice. Do what you will, of course. I just hate seeing newer folks lose money when they don't have to. We all come here to see green in our portfolios. You can, too.",2021-02-12 05:20:17

If you read this release: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hyliion-introduces-next-generation-battery-182300641.html

You'll see:

1. They are using Toshiba cells, not their own.
2. Cooling batteries is known to make them charge faster and have greater efficiency.

This is not next gen. It's a new battery cooler. I'm sure it's cool, but it's not 1 billion in market cap cool.

I went heavy on puts. This isn't just mouthing off. 
I'll post gain or lose porn accordingly.

Edit: I read more and did more DD.
They have -27 P/E
The tech is for class 8 trucks, which again, while cool, aren't in production from a brief look, but rather they are in early stages.

Again,  just not impressed.

Edit 2: looking at older articles about them.

That they look bad for having now institutional ownership.

That they are not 'in it for the long haul https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hyliion-isn-t-long-haul-200100050.html

They will under perform for 2021

Defending them using warrants.

Eesh. I'm gonna buy more puts.

Edit 3: Thanks for the gold. Also, you gotta see who is an autist and who is the retard. The autists do DD, post value, and know how stuff works. The autist bail in and make money of they listen to the autists. Right now that ratio is messed up. But it'll get fixed.

Edit 4: position https://i.imgur.com/1JrLJnE.png


Edit 5: GME still has a new CEO and is doing PCs. Are there bagholders? APHA and TLRY are still merging, are there gonna be bag holders?

Edit 6: the more I read the more I think this company is total crap. They burned people with vaporware a year ago, they have no deliverables or direct path to profit. And if you look through the bulk of the articles in the last year almost all day things like ""if you're looking for an EV play this isn't it"".  I'm going so far as to say if you hold this it's because of sink cost fallacy and cognitive dissonance, or just fucking cognitive impairment. Plus they got to NASDAQ cause they are a SPAC which is a cheat code for garbage companies to get on real exchanges. This should have died as a penny stock on the pink sheets.",2021-02-12 05:15:36

-a large portion of the market share selling B2B in an industry that has been killing it for years.

I usually skip on companies that beat earnings and gap up cause I figure I missed the boat. But I think this still has room to run. They've broken out of the 20 day SMA on the news this week of an earnings beat (Monday) that they will be added to the S&P midcap 400 (yesterday). **This means index etfs will start scooping up shares.** And Citi analyst price target increases today to $15 from $13 https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-amkor-technology-stock-just-jumped-again-2021-02-11

$EWJ - JOIN MICHAEL BURRY IN AN ETF WITH CONCRETE POSITIVE GROWTH,118,lhu6vv,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhu6vv/ewj_join_michael_burry_in_an_etf_with_concrete/,74,1613104903.0,"Earlier this week, our beloved Dr. Michael Burry (the dude who predicted the housing crisis, the dude who predicted GME, the dude who predicts fucking everything honestly), tweeted about Japan finally lifting their ‚Äúiron coffin lid‚Äù as he called it. While this tweet is now deleted, as Burry frequently wipes his Twitter, it led me down a hole which I believe to have discovered a golden opportunity. This ‚Äúiron coffin lid‚Äù of Japan‚Äôs has been rumored to break free for a while now, but hasn‚Äôt. 

[https://moneyweek.com/476357/the-charts-that-matter-can-japan-lift-the-iron-coffin-lid](https://moneyweek.com/476357/the-charts-that-matter-can-japan-lift-the-iron-coffin-lid)

Yet, Burry believes the time has finally come. As such he is heavenly invested in Japanese corporations. 

An excerpt from Burry‚Äôs tweet: ‚Äú#ironcoffinlid opening? If so, the contents are the likes of which are never seen in the western world.‚Äù

This led me to find, $EWJ. An ETF consisting of **85% OF JAPAN‚ÄôS STOCKS**. (That‚Äôs a lot!). No, you didn't read that wrong. Not 85% of EWJ consists of Japanese stock, EWJ consists of roughly 85% of the investible universe of securities traded in Japan. 

Some of the top companies that they hold the majority of their equity in include:

**NINTENDO**

**SONY**

**TOYOTA**

**MITSUBISHI**

**TOKYO ELECTRON**

**SOFTBANK GROUP**

I mean wow, what a stacked top contenders list.

**Nintendo only has positive year after year growth**, and after the revolution of the Switch, they are back on their feet with eyes forward. 

**Sony only has positive year after year growth.** Sony is a company that pioneers technology in all aspects, video-games, TV, music, etc. 

**Toyota only has positive year after year growth.** I expect this to skyrocket as well as we transition to the age of EVs. *Earlier this week Toyota announced their electric vehicles are coming THIS YEAR. Toyota also recently partnered with PANASONIC to manufacture their batteries for said EVs.* 

**While Mitsubishi has had their ups and downs, we still see a net positive year after year return.** Mitsubishi is Japan‚Äôs *LARGEST TRADING COMPANY. With HIGH POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE FUTURE IN 2022+ AS THEY MOVE INTO EVs AS WELL.*

**Tokyo Electron** **only has positive year after year growth**. Going from a penny stock to $100 in less than 5 years, Tokyo Electron is looking like a very serious worldwide company moving forward. Founded in 1963, Tokyo Electron has been a manufacturer of ***semiconductors***, technology for the future that they have been pioneering for 50 YEARS NOW. You know all the people spamming $ON on here? That is a semiconductor play as well. This is just a safer gateway into that industry.

**SoftBank Group only has positive year after year growth.** Softbank is *THE WORLD‚ÄôS LARGEST TECHNOLOGY FOCUSED VENTURE CAPITAL FUND, WITH OVER 100 BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL.* 

These 6 are simply a very small few of EWJ‚Äôs top holdings. As you can see the road ahead is bright, almost blinding. EWJ took a dip during COVID, but is now coming out of that hole stronger and faster. If we take a look at EWJ‚Äôs chart we can see a lot of consistent breakout patterns occurring recently, lining up with Burry‚Äôs idea. 

Let‚Äôs take a look at the covid dip:

![img](uzamwpn52rg61 ""
"")

As we can see in early 2020 when we saw covid happen, the 100-day average passed downward through the 20-day average, as we spiral down. **However, we then see one of the quickest recoveries ever during the pandemic** as already in April the 20 day average passes through the 100 day and we begin our flight to the moon.

I decided to snoop around WSB and see if anyone else was talking about this. I stumbled upon u/ThePoorLad‚Äôs post where he also notes a breakout pattern. His image below:

https://preview.redd.it/n940mw4c2rg61.jpg?width=1075&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21596b94408506af11a5e4d6194aea781644fca2

Yet, let's continue snooping around EWJ‚Äôs graph and see if we find anything worth paying attention to..

As you can see, this week we have a very prevailing and very bullish staircase pattern, this following Burry‚Äôs tweet, seems to be the beginning of EWJ‚Äôs true soar to 100+. 

The options for EWJ have little to no volume. They are cheap as fuck. This is a stock no one fucking knows about. It just seems like a random Japan ETF, ‚Äúwho would want to get in on that?‚Äù No one realizes what's about to happen, (except our boy Burry). This is a golden opportunity to get in before the crowd. 

Look at these **2023 LEAPS**, 20 FUCKING 23, and look how cheap they are.  

https://preview.redd.it/k41hu75o2rg61.png?width=907&format=png&auto=webp&s=a68277f216bcecc95243a8ce025cc2df4367f58a

EWJ has gone up $30 alone in the past half-year, and that is without this ""iron coffin lid"" rising. In my opinion, EWJ will EASILY hit 105 in **2021, let alone 2022 or 2023**. Take a look at the rest of the call sheet, yourself, they are cheap as fuck. 

Earlier this week Financial Times posted an article talking about how Japanese stocks are climbing to their highest levels since 1991. The stars are all aligning.

Position: 2023 100C @ 105

**TLDR:** *Michael Burry believes Japan‚Äôs iron coffin lid will open to the likes of things that the western world has never seen. $EWJ only has positive growth potential and is about to break out. Options are also cheap as fuck. Moon mission has already begun.*  *üöÄ*

Every huge company in the world is missing semiconductors: ""companies like Apple, Qualcomm, Sony, and AMD have all cited shortages in recent weeks, with effects ranging from part shortages for iPhones to the incredibly hard-to-find nature of the PlayStation 5 or AMD‚Äôs newest CPUs and GPUs. But in today‚Äôs increasingly connected world, a shortage of semiconductor chips impacts not only traditional technology industries, but also a wide-ranging list of other industries. Numerous automotive companies ‚Äî including Volkswagen, Fiat Chrysler, and Toyota ‚Äî have been forced to temporarily suspend vehicle production over the past several months. And Ford just announced that it would be pausing manufacturing on its most lucrative F-150 trucks earlier this month in the wake of chip shortages.""

All these companies are just begging for more semi-conductors, and $ON and others are almost completely out. When production starts ramping up again the huge demand will increase their earnings even more: THIS IS A LONG AND SHORT PLAY.

"PLTR, the MM's Fav Target - A Bumpy Road",116,lhtpz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhtpz8/pltr_the_mms_fav_target_a_bumpy_road/,91,1613103673.0,"Gotta say. The MM (Market Manipulation fyi) on top of the over-fixation of the Lockup and the bi-polar MKT have really been the biggest things that have stopped [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) fucking cold from climbing higher up the mountain.

Nobody really seems to really be prioritizing the ER on Tuesday. And with how deep down we've gone in the rabbit hole, it isn't really helping our case to just ""be faithful"" and ""BTFD"" for these Shorters/soon to be. Everyone's just focused on the next Catalyst 3 days after it which is going to Pullback on the price - for the short term. So possible Holders are waiting on that before buying in and myopic Bulls are selling because ""it isn't $40 fml"" and are reacting to the sudden drops + Lockup as their confirmation.

Don't get me wrong, ER is still significant. There still is hype around it that isn't just going to vanish. And with how badly PLTR has dropped since yesterday (back to the old ATH), then some people are going to be a bit interested; cheap shares, cheap calls right. So some positive volume can come from that. But understand, whatever happens there/tmrw will define how next week is going to go into the Lockup as Monday is closed off due to being a holiday. They will be the impetuses, if good or bad, for the weekly trend basically.

Still, this type of plunge manifests despite huge contracts being signed left and right, with no Bear signals/bad news against it other than valuation, which is as irrelevant as it has ever been in this warped MKT. The IBM deal which was a huge deal for Palantir... wiped away in 2 days, like all the other deals, trounced. Bull Catalysts, which should build hype for ER - the biggest Bull Catalyst of all - don't mean jack and it ""surprisingly"" goes into the Red big time, the opposite of what should occur.

Really the manipulation on this stock is beyond apparent. The hate against it is well documented and it dates back to the start when they opened the way Big Daddy Institutions didn't want. When ""MM"" is really the only major thing that can be said about going against such an initially great Bull Run + why it's doing what it's doing, then you know something has to be a little wonky internally. It's not natural.

But really, ain't much we can do about it. At this point, I said to go for the ER but with how bad of a spot we're in, idek what to say. Really if you're not Long/Deep in the Money and you're just a newb who wants to get in, really I say just wait it out. Palantir is so volatile and irrationally controlled that anything could really happen from now until the Lockup.

And look, this is a great company, with great tech. It's a great hold for the Long and years down the road. But in the short term, it's going through these violent financial assaults constantly, and it throws the stock back down as soon it somewhat starts to shoot up into the sky. It really isn't all the stable right now. But for those who know PLTR, follow the routine, it ain't gonna change and that's a fact. For those who still don't know how it goes in its way up the mountain? It is what it is.

The Retail Trader Wave,39,lht2ai,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lht2ai/the_retail_trader_wave/,28,1613102016.0," 

These last few weeks have been bizarre in terms of the stock market and it has left me at a complete lost as to what ""up & coming"" companies to put my money on at the moment. I am feeling that I would like to outline my running thesis as to what has been going on.

The GME gamma squeeze has changed a whole lot. Probably this is just a short term distrubance, though it could be a continual change, I really don't know.

\*\*So what has happened?\*\*

\*\*Part 1 - Gamestop\*\*

Gamestop and its prophesied gamma squeeze awoke the hoard. Tens, if not hundreds of thousands of newby traders exploded out onto the freshly burgeoning retail trading platforms to take advantage of the promise of riches beyond belief.

You see a rumour began to spread that the ruling financial elites had gotten greedy, they had over extended, and trapped themselves in an unwinnable situation. How lucky we all now were. We simply needed to buy up these shares and we would soar to the moon carried by a rocket, powered by the elites lost money. It was irresistible. It was a promise not only of immense wealth, but also of destroying those that had destroyed others so many times.

This, of course, didn't end as most people expected. The elites escaped their fate. The early traders made millions, most won minor amounts and some lost more then they could.

\*\*Part 2 - The Fallout\*\*

So, suddenly the market had become open to a hoard of fresh traders that had gotten a taste, a teaser of what they could make from a hobby in stock trading. They had only two questions on their mind ""What stocks are the next GME?"" & ""Which of these winning stocks can I afford and win the most?"".

These two questions inevitably led them to one place... THE PENNY STOCKS! (also stocks under about $30) Though, most of them couldn't access all penny stocks, just those penny stocks that are avaliable on most standard trading platforms.

\*\*Part 3 - Thesis\*\*

I am doing away with the story like tone of this now, though I hope you enjoyed that.

Essentially, A ton middle class people that don't have ridiclous amounts of money surged into the market and have all been trying to guess the next GME/Big thing and many have just been following trends on mass. The issue with this is there is currently ""seemingly"" high quality DD posts being made of virtually every widely avaliable stock under $10, and of many stocks that are a bit higher than $10.

I imagine, because of this, many people might be experiencing the same problems as me now.

1. It is much harder to tell which low cost stocks are actually potentially good long term investments and which are riding the hype wave and new trader wave.
2. Many of the potentially good long term stocks have shot way past what there forecast long term gains had been. So, I am left wondering how far they will recede back, if at all, and when should i buy back in.

I am curious what the take of other traders on here are about handling this situation?

Personally these are the steps I have taken.

I have benefited with a small amount of winnings both from GME & from weed stocks as well as some of the other penny stock gains. I have taken all of my money out of these sort of plays temporarily and moved most of it into safer long term investments. Most into a few different ETF's, some into SQ, Microsoft, Apple.

Though I have kept a small amount ( an amount I have no problem loosing) and I chucked it into a Tanzanian gold company stock, ""why"", you may ask, ""have you moved stocks into a strange unimpressive tanzanian gold mining company?"" simply because it was one of the last widely accesbile(that is to say avaliable on most amatuer trading platforms) penny stocks under $1, I suspect it may move up simply because of how cheap it is. Stocks under $1 seem, at least temporarily, to be soaring for the simple fact of being under $1.",2021-02-12 03:53:36
Adaptability makes HYLN a diamond in the rough [DD],291,lhsm8e,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhsm8e/adaptability_makes_hyln_a_diamond_in_the_rough_dd/,128,1613100916.0,"**TLDR: Hyliion is a gateway drug to EV and their adaptability in the Class 8 industry makes them a great long term play with deep fucking valueüöÄ.**

It seems like everyday there is a new company coming out of the woodworks with a plan for hydrogen fuel cell trucks or fully electric powertrains. While the Biden administration has certainly added some fuel to the EV fire, everyone (including that gay üåàüêª Mark Delaney from GS) seems to be sleeping on a company that is poised to succeed no matter what renewable energy solution is chosen.

While still in its early stages as a company after going public (via S word) in late 2020, Hyliion (HYLN), provides **full powertrain solutions** for fleets through 2 main products:

1. **Hybrid Diesel or CHG** ‚Äì as the name states this is an electric hybrid powertrain with either Diesel or renewable natural gas. There are some interesting differences between the diesel & CNG options, but we‚Äôll save that for another time. These **powertrains are available now** and they have been shipping in low volumes this year with volume expected to increase throughout the year. The great thing with this solution is it can be **installed on most major Class 8 trucks with no additional driver training**.
2. **Hypertruck ERX** ‚Äì this is the secret sauce that our buddy Thomas Healy will (IMO) change the world with. This is a fuel agnostic, fully electric powertrain that uses an **onboard generator** powered by RNG (for now) to locally charge the truck. This reduces the need for a large battery pack that cuts into the payload capacity of the truck while also extending the range of the truck to well over **1,000** **miles.** Hyliion has already partnered with American Natural Gas (ANG) to ensure they can not only meet the demand for RNG, but they can leverage this partnership to offer fleets better pricing across the country.

These two products provide HYLN the adaptability needed in these uncertain times. Right now, their approach is to go with RNG since the infrastructure is already there across the country & it is ready to be rolled out in full production by 2022. üåàüêª Mark Delaney must have had Elon‚Äôs cock in his ear during the last Tesla earnings call, because he seemed to miss him saying ‚Äúit would not make sense for us to do the Semi right now, but it will absolutely make sense for us to do it as soon as we can address the cell production constraint‚Äù. Never doubt Elon, but it doesn‚Äôt sound like they will be in full production with the Semi by 2022 (even if they plan to build a plant in NV this year). With that being said, Hyliion is already producing & selling their Hybrid solution, with the hope to launch demo ERX with fleets this year, while starting production in 2022.

Which brings us to the most important question, how are they manufacturing these things? Unlike building their own plants, which has its own pros/cons, HYLN is partnering with others. This accelerates the timeline of getting products to the market and allows them to **focus on what they are good at.**

***Isn‚Äôt the increased demand in Hydrogen fuel cell a concern for a company that is focused on RNG***\*\*?\*\* No and no. Everyone loves to talk about hydrogen but no one seems to be realistic about when it will be ready. Aside from the lack of infrastructure across the country that will take years to build out, the cost of hydrogen is more than **10x higher than natural gas**. Not only are the costs higher, but the way a majority of hydrogen is currently being produced is coming from steam methane which is more pollutive than a diesel truck. AND even if all of those negatives were solved by next year, Hyliion is still working on a hydrogen solution (in addition to RNG) for their onboard generators for the Hypertruck. Essentially they have you covered if you want to go the RNG route or Hydrogen (when ready).

***The cost of Diesel is below $3, will this affect the appetite for companies to adopt EV?*** [According to Healy](https://event.webcasts.com/viewer/event.jsp?ei=1425939&tp_key=75b5f9e241), with diesel at $3 there is a **2 year payback period** for fleet operators. Obviously as prices go lower this payback period increases, but most fleets have a 5-7 year lifespan so adding a year or two to the PP doesn‚Äôt have much of an impact considering the benefits.

***Price target?*** I am not a financial advisor, but I am a little autistic so I dug into [Hyliions original investor presentation](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1759631/000121390020015311/ea123187ex99-3_tortoiseacq.htm) from their pre-IPO. We haven‚Äôt really gotten any new updates to these numbers, but I still think this is a hidden gem based on their projections. Assuming the Hypertruck meets all of their expectations, they anticipate around 2% of the Class 8 market share by 2024 (a more than $94 billion addressable market). If they can reach EBITDA of $602m by 2024 as projected, then a price of $18/share should be the floor right now. However, with some good/bad news on the upcoming Feb 23 earnings call this could all change in an instant.

It is my belief that gold peaked in August 2020 and will continue to decline from current levels through the rest of this year.  Here are my reasons.  

1.  There is not enough inflation in the US dollar to drive prices up further.  
2. There is no shortage and never will be.  
3. The charts peaked in August and are now in pattern of making new low then recovering before making another new low.  
4. Gold is boomer shit.  People would rather buy digital coins, weed, or SPACs with their stimulus money.  
5. India/China are big importers for jewelry and increased prices have a big impact on demand.  
6. Interest rates aren't going up anytime soon.  
7. Gold is trading below falling 10, 20, 50 day moving averages.

TLDR, post-GME, WSB became a pack of brainless wolves who hunt down penny stocks and spam the yahoo conversations with the same tired ""LeT's tAkE tHiS sToCk tO 100!!11!!""  


The group retardation is exponential when you also hear shit like ""I'm down 100k but w/e we're still going to the moon"". Not only retarded, but gluttons for punishment. It's as if losing money somehow temporarily ""boosts"" your group think morale before you reality sets in and you realize there's no way back out.   


Do you even know how a company is valuated? You can artificially pump all you want, it doesn't actually MAKE the company worth what you've inflated it to. I can't believe I have to explain this, but for serious investors in this who have done their DD, would project to sell at a set point (if they're risk averse). Anything beyond that point is pure volatility. a stock like SNDL would NEVER organically hit $100 with the current state of their business. Even with you retards pumping it up artificially, it would never hit $100 anyway because any reasonable person would start dumping once they see the kind of manipulation is at play. Case and point, the events of SNDL this fucking morning. Do you still think it'll go to $100?   


I used to take the word ""retard"" being thrown around here in jest; but now I'm pretty convinced that the folks ( as mentioned in my previous example above) are un-ironically retarded. 

Is this going to be the new thing now? Every Penny stock going to be pumped and dumped? You realize by doing this, you're no fucking better than the hedge funds you purportedly hate. You're acting as a hive mind to inflate then dump. This is why I think post GME, WSB has and will continue to decline unless something is done about this. 

So, for those actually looking to invest wisely here, if you ever see a penny stock being posted with no DD or futures to back it up, do yourself a favour and avoid the risk. Yes, you can probably get real lucky and ride the short term wave then dump, but if you're wanting to be a SERIOUS investor, just ignore the bullshit posted here.   


Making money is fun until you lose it all.  


On a more sober note, SNDL's futures are somewhat hopeful (my personal opinion) based on some POTENTIAL acquisitions, so I will be sticking around for a little bit. Am I taking a risk? Yes. This is still a speculative stock, and fortunately I don't gamble away a mortgage for something like this.",2021-02-12 02:47:42

Limit gains work by auto selling your stock when it hits a price point that is higher than the stock price, and gains are  enough to be satisfied.

Stop loss sales: stop loss sales are sett up to limit the amount of money you can lose b4 your stock auto sells. These are used to guarantee your minimum acceptable gains and get out b4 you hold the bag. 

Example: bought 100 sundial stocks at 1.99$ avg price and when it hit 3.52$ last night I put a stop loss sale at 2.75$ I overslept last night and missed the surge, and I should have put a limit gain @ 4$, but I forgot too. The stop loss sale executed at 2.89$ making me about 95$ before the stock plummeted to 2.20$ potentially eliminating all my gains. I'm a broke college student so I really needed that money for groceries/valentines day so I'm glad I did this.

‚òÄÔ∏èSummary:‚òÄÔ∏è
- $SNDL being shorted
- They are now debt free, while others weed stocks are filled with debt. 
- SNDL has lots of potential and many plans of development
- +Weed (once fully legalüìà)
- under valued, compare other weed stonks, most around 5b market avg and yes those are for known companies but who‚Äôs to say SNDL won‚Äôt grow, so far they‚Äôve been making smart business decisions.
- This stock has actual real potential, long term goal of $10.


‚òÄÔ∏èCommon Questions?:‚òÄÔ∏è

- ‚ùìWhy is cannabis Shorted‚ùì
-Cannabis has been getting heavily shorted for quite some time because of legalization, shorts have made it very difficult for this life changing industry to flourish the way it should. 

-  ‚ùìIs cannabis industry over rated‚ùì
-No, cannabis stocks are overrated when they are 10b+ market cap before legalization and/or heavy revenues. Which is the case with some marijuana stocks. But $SNDL was well under 1b market cap, for a growing cannabis industry; this is highly undervalued. We are not saying $SNDL should be around the other popular mainstream cannabis stocks. But it should at least be higher 5b market cap.

- ‚ùìSndl is Canadian , legalisation is US‚ùì-
-Yes, you don‚Äôt think being able to expand nd distribute to US markets will help to grow?

- ‚ùìwhy was $Sndl preforming bad before‚ùì
-1Ô∏è‚É£They had bad managment, the new ceo Zach will turn it around you can see in pics above. 2Ô∏è‚É£Marijuana industry wasn‚Äôt as recognized before. 3Ô∏è‚É£ They were faced with huge set backs, if you look at one of the articles below. They had 2 fires which resulted in huge loss of products, floods, humidity control issues, and leaks. Yet they managed to stay debt free‚ùóÔ∏è. This was all not in their hands and due to having a shit location and poor building management/control.4Ô∏è‚É£As I mentioned they had setbacks, major one was poor warehouse control and management which resulted in humidity issues that further caused mold in the warehouse/cannabis. This has all been resolved and they implemented a new manager.

- ‚ùìcannabis industry has political issues‚ùì
-well for starter, the marijuana industry is no longer going to have those political issues with the Biden administration hopefully pushing it forward. Also, regarding SNDL the stock is highly undervalued compared to other weed stocks. Which doesn‚Äôt make sense because yea they‚Äôve had major setbacks but somehow they‚Äôre debt free. It‚Äôs a cannabis company that looks to be making smart business decisions plus the new ceo will make a positive change, we are not saying it‚Äôs the next canopy or are trying to promote it as the leading cannabis stock. But instead we are trying to show you a potential stock that can boom due to being undervalued. To add on, SNDL is heavily shorted which brings a possibility of a small squeeze. They have until June to keep their share price above $1 for 10days or it will get delisted. So far the price is heading in the right direction.

- ‚ùìregarding questions about 1b market cap nd if it can reach 5b:‚ùìOk looking at SNDL market cap it‚Äôs currently at 1.3b and the company wasn‚Äôt even doing that well before because of major set backs I mentioned above, so you don‚Äôt think after having a new ceo, and making smarter business moves; that it‚Äôs possible for it to reach a 5b market cap, almost all cannabis companies are average round or close to 5b market cap, and none of them seem to be generating any high revenue, because cannabis is still under full legalization. And if you‚Äôre wondering what smart business moves SNDL made, well for starter they are debt free‚ùóÔ∏èwhile many/all other marijuana stocks are still piled with debt. SNDL is debt free after going through two fires that caused massive losses and constantly burning through cash, like all other cannabis stocks. Look at this article here: https://www.google.com/s/www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/03/3-pot-stocks-to-avoid-like-the-plague-in-february/  you can see most cannabis stocks aren‚Äôt generating any revenue and there all burning through cash and filled with debt except SNDL has no more debt‚ùóÔ∏èand here in this article: https://www.google.com/s/www.nasdaq.com/articles/is-sundial-growers-planning-a-splashy-deal-2021-01-22%3 you can see how they are trying to possibly expand. so a $5b cap is quite realistic.

-  ‚ùìMany people keep asking about its market cap at 1b‚ùì Lol u say it‚Äôs over valued at 1b? What makes you say that, is it because their not generating any high revenue or their burning through cash. Yet, all other cannabis stocks are faced with the same issue and not to mention they are all piled with debt except SNDL‚ùóÔ∏èIf you‚Äôre basing your facts that it‚Äôs overvalued because of its revenue performance than you might as well say all cannabis stocks are overvalued because most if not all, are still burning through cash. And the top cannabis stocks you guys mention are Nowhere near a penny stock, which diminishes their entire purpose. The point of this post is to show a penny stock that can potentially boom due to being undervalued in comparison to others. Not trying to list the top leading cannabis stocks, which is what you guys keep mentioning.

- ‚ùìHow is $SNDL financials and revenue‚ùì

  - [This article here talks about how they raised 600million cash and all their debt obligations are gone ](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/once-down-weeds-cash-strapped-174412731.html)

  - [Here you can see their financials is bad and their revenue is not high but it‚Äôs because they‚Äôre trying to shift into retail from wholesale, also in the article you can see multiple cannabis stocks burning through cash and have similar revenues but only SNDL is debt free ](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/22/3-marijuana-stocks-that-could-fall-47-wall-street/)

  - [last article here you can see other cannabis stocks that burn through cash and have poor revenue but that the case with most if not all marijuana stocks as the industry is just beginning ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.fool.com/amp/investing/2021/02/03/3-pot-stocks-to-avoid-like-the-plague-in-february/)

  - I listed these two articles to show you how many different cannabis stocks are burning through cash and piled with debt. $SNDL‚Äôs revenue isn‚Äôt high just like all those cannabis stocks except $SNDL has no more debt. Those articles don‚Äôt contradict my post I am telling you that SNDL doesn‚Äôt have high revenue but all those other cannabis stocks don‚Äôt have high revenue either but yet they have 5b+ market caps. So there revenue position is the same as $SNDL burning through cash and not generating high revenue  $SNDL is debt free and now has 600mill cash at hand. Do you understand the advantage??? In that article you can see aurora cannabis and cronos are burning through cash and have debt!!! Yet there market caps are higher than $SNDL even tho SNDL wiped its debt and has 600mill cash. Most if not all cannabis stocks are burning through cash and piled with debt, because legalization still taking place....


  - They raised 600mill in cash and wiped out ALL their debt obligations. ANY logical person can see how beneficial this is. They raised 600mill to re-invest back in to the business!! Looking into the long term there is endless possibilities for this company they can have many upcoming catalyst. They can use this money for expansion, buying out a competitor, or the introduction of a new product. Which $SNDL has talked about multiple acquisitions, mergers or overall expanding the company.


- ‚ùìregarding the questions about Canadian companies in the us market ‚ùì-Well for starter how do you know that once US goes through full legalization they won‚Äôt accept Canadian companies to flourish. There‚Äôs already major Canadian companies expanding in the us, and you don‚Äôt think SNDL is capable of doing an acquisition with a us company or let alone expanding their product/name to the us. Even if they partially succeed in expanding to the Us, they can still be major players in the Canadian cannabis industry you‚Äôre talking about a growing 37mill population with 99% cannabis enthusiasts. SNDL has lots of potential to grow. Search up this article (sundial growers splashy deal-nasdaq)

I am no financial advisor DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH. I can‚Äôt provide you with all the info or predictions on whether this stock will rise or sink. I am quite bullish on this stock based on my reasons, but there are multiple sources online that can further elaborate on where this stock is heading.

8th grade research project: $NVDA,52,lhrf27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhrf27/8th_grade_research_project_nvda/,41,1613097792.0,"Swear to god if the automod removes this... 

Alright listen up retards. NVDA is going to print at earnings. 

#Retard Analysis
Over the last three quarters, Nvidia EPS growth averaged 81%. They have earnings on the 24th, probably going to do well. CHRISTMAS could have some helpful effect as more people get into PC gaming. Especially with the shortage of PS5 and Xbox X that could have pushed some over the edge to switch. Regardless it would be a minor, but still positive impact. 

#Expanding Business 
Looking at Q3 2020 reports we can see some great news in expanding their business. Saw revenue and sales up 57%, a new record for them. 

* ""Launched the NVIDIA¬Æ EGX Intelligent Edge Computing Platform to bring accelerated AI to retail, manufacturing, telecommunications, logistics and other industries, with Walmart, BMW, NTT East, Procter & Gamble and Samsung Electronics among early adopters"". 
 
* USPS is going to use their AI tech to improve packaging process. 

* Loads of updates to software and companies adding RTX support showing they are becoming a standard in the industry. 

* The push forward on AI with self driving that is surely to increase going forward long term. 

* Their data center division revenue passed their gaming division and we all know data is the gold mine *PLTR autist PTSD*. Data center sales increased 162%.

#Red Hat
But the item im most interested in is the Red Hat collab they are starting. They are trying to get more involved with 5G telecom market by making virtualized 5G RAN networks using their GPUs. Retardedly put, they want to simplify how current telecom traffic works and make it more harmonized: to bring down maintenance and management costs; increase flexibility; allow multiple vendors to work on the same hardware and share resources. Further, Red Hat is going to become a major player in the cloud services industry. Azure and AWS just don't have the same capabilities as Red Hat's open source infrastructure and having a good relationship with NVDA looks great for future projects.   

#Semiconductor shortage easing
The world is coming off the end of a semiconductor shortage that was showing some recovery before COVID. Likely there will be no shortage going further into this year, maybe even early as Q2. Many of the car manufactures have been feeling the effects of the semi conductor shortage, even having to shut down factories temporarily before the situation improves. Bodes well for NVDA, supply is constricted and the pent up demand will blow its metaphorical load heavily at NVDA and other semis. 

#Bear case
The only hiccup: ARM merger deal is running into problems from anti-trust complaints by competitors. Likely to not happen when China reviews it and says no. The merger would make ARM US based and have the same US restrictions on exporting tech to Huawei or other blacklisted companies. Same thing happened with Qualcomm and N_X_P (automod removing small cap tickers) semiconductors. But on the off chance it does go through from both 1) The US taking a different stance towards China and 2) NVDA convincing regulators that ARM would still have impartiality for how it does business, the upside is massive. Not too concerned with it not happening since NVDA will adapt and move on. Its more of a bonus to NVDA and would only add to their underlying business that is already doing very good.


#What the big money is doing

Increased from 150 hedges funds with NVDA in their top 10 holdings to 218 in Q3 2020.

#TA for mentally ill
Has been largely stagnant since September, just now hitting new highs. Summarized crayons TA: Some major resistance at ~590 and just broke it and has been holding for the last 2 days. RSI is a little over bought, Id be guessing there is some sideways action for a couple days and then a run up and beat at earnings.

Bumble's business model is garbo tbh.

Having women message first on dating sites is suboptimal, and we know they will never initiate unless the dude is over an 8. Also, you only have a 24-hour time limit to even respond to messages. Which means there is a limited time to get a match or strike up a conversation. They also got into a huge settlement with their boost which was found to be misleading their customers. You can read more about the Bumble Settlement here: https://www.bumbleboostsettlement.com/

 Dating apps have high turnover and cause burnout fast. Also, consider that Tinder and other dating apps like POF and OKCupid have higher name recognition and more market share, and you'll see why Bumble's growth is capped. Don't bother buying high IMO.

[TSLA] Pelosi leaps playbook,66,lhr4ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhr4ld/tsla_pelosi_leaps_playbook/,62,1613097029.0,"You may have all heard that Pelosi's husband bought [1m in tsla calls.](https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/public_disc/ptr-pdfs/2021/20018011.pdf) last month.

Maybe some of you are getting sick of chasing after GME and APHA wrecked your asses and wanna play some real stocks IDK.

I believe that bets are best placed BEFORE the stock is at ATH, so I think this is a good time to post this while TSLA is going through some dips.

There is a lot to talk about when it comes to everyone's favorite CEO, but I think the biggest headwinds are these:

1. EV credits are coming
2. FSD beta currently being used by 1000 lucky(?) Tesla drivers.
3. The House Majority Leader Pelosi bought leaps. 
4. *censored topic here*

I don't wanna make this really long, so I just want to go over what exactly she bought.

25 contracts [$500 strike expiring at March 18, 2022](https://imgur.com/Nlw4PWZ) 

Note that she's actually down about 30k on these as of today. Are you mad about politicians insider trading? Well holy fuck you have a chance to get in at LESS than what she paid.

This is what her payout looks like: https://imgur.com/blP7gLZ

Basically she can't lose any money unless TSLA closes below $940 in by March 2022. However, you will notice that the leverage applied is only 1~2x. Basically this is like baby leverage vs holding shares.

I wanted to entertain some alternatives. So what if you got bigger balls and say TSLA doubles from here at the minimum? https://imgur.com/ZZGDYUN

You can see the upside is so much higher but tsla has to move a lot fast to outrun the theta burn.

So what if you thought about theta and want to spread it instead? (A spread is when you buy a call then sell a call further otm.) https://imgur.com/HoPgNl1

You probably noticed here that payout distribution gets bigger as you get close to expiration. Personally I think this is a better play than ITM calls, but of course, if TSLA pulls another 5x from here, nothing beats the uncapped upside of plain calls.

At the end of the day however, if TSLA just goes down 10% from here and doesn't come back for a year, all of these are expiring worthless. Btw kind of fucking crazy that if you have 100 TSLA shares you can collect almost guaranteed 60% a year. 

Did you buy GME because you hate the establishment and their privileged trading free money? Well, they're doing this one in broad daylight. Would you take it? 

Also not financial advice. Gamble your chrome money at your own risk.

I like kitties but I am not into roaring.

$CLNE Super Bull Case,38,lhqmxz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhqmxz/clne_super_bull_case/,42,1613095737.0,CLNE Clean Energy Corporation is a GIANT sleeping bull just starting to wake up in my opinion. (Not financial advice just my opinion) The stock is up over 500% in the past year and there are good reasons why. The market cap as of now is $3 billion so it still is relatively small and has a lot of room to run. I know some people might think it‚Äôs already up 500% where is the room to run... I get it but if PLUG can go from around $1 to $65 for gods sake CLNE can make a huge run too. CLNE revenue last quarter was $70.89 million up from the previous quarter of $59.87. They are not profitable yet but close to being profitable. The earnings per share last quarter was -0.01. Not bad. Previous quarter‚Äôs EPS was -0.02. Earnings is in March and it is expected for the earnings to be 0.01 per share. They have scored multiple contracts and recently a major one with L.A County Metro. For the LA County Metro they will be supplying 47.5 million gallons of renewable natural gas. Clean Energy Fuels scores a five-year contract to supply renewable natural gas for the nation's largest transit bus fleet. Also analysts are bullish on CLNE. Tuesday February 3rd Shares of Clean Energy Fuels¬†soared after the natural gas marketer and retailer received an initial rating of outperform with a price target of $17 from Credit Suisse. MarketBeat shows a consensus price target of $18.67. PLUG revenue was around $100 million last quarter and still not profitable. I think we will see profitability soon with CLNE. The Clean energy industry is just getting starting. I first bought in at around $12 and slowly added to original position. Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs to come in the near future.,2021-02-12 02:08:57

Hi y'all, if you are a nerd like I am, you should be aware that a lot of consumer electronics have been out of stock for months or having supply chain shortages (see: PS5, NVIDIA GPUs, AMD CPUs, phones, etc etc)

This is mostly attributable to COVID, but one of the sectors hit the hardest is semiconductor manufacturing. It has been dubbed the Chipocalypse: https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/whats-causing-the-chip-shortage-affecting-ps5-cars-and-more.html

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-11/biden-team-pledges-aggressive-steps-to-address-chip-shortage

I think semiconductor foundries and chip makers are severely undervalued because of the current crisis, so I'm going in hard. I saw a DD about $ON having low IVs so I went in a few days ago, but I think with this news I'm gonna double down.

The TLDR for these posts is that the big winner here is going to be TSMC. TSMC is the leading chip foundry in the world. It produces chips for Intel, AMD, Apple, and many others. 

My thesis: The chip shortage is already priced into the current value of TSMC. I still have 9 shares of TSM, but I am going long on those. This is a shorter term play based off of the ongoing automotive semiconductor shortage. TSMC sources it's wafers from 5 suppliers, 4 of which are publicly traded. These companies are F.K.S., MEMC, S.E.H., Siltronic, SUMCO. These 5 companies produce 85% of the worlds raw wafers. Shin-Etsu produces 33% of the worlds wafers. Shin-Etsu is also positioning itself to be one of the primary producers of the chips that are invloved in the automotive industry shortage. In addition, Shin-Etsu is one of TSMC's primary suppliers of Photoresist. Finally, Shin-Etsu is based in Taiwan, TSMC is fully aware of this and is taking full advantage of the logistics advantages associated with Shin-Etsu's geographical position. 
TLDR: I think that SHECY is going to see a rapids spike in the next 6 months.

Now all I see if people asking who is still holding stocks that have been squozed and are running your leveraged accounts into the ground.

Today I bring you an opportunity to make money once again. The $RBLX infinite money glitch. For those unaware Roblox is set to IPO soon. What does this mean? Unlimited money for your dick implants so you can finally satisfy your wife like her boyfriend does.

Step 1) Open position on Roblox after IPO

Step 2) Stock goes up, make money, and use money to purchase in-game currency in Roblox

Step 3) Absolutely steez out your Roblox avatar, while simultaneously increasing revenue for Roblox

Step 4) Roblox beats earnings estimates with increased guidance from new revenue and repeat steps 2-4 forever

&#x200B;

EDIT: It is a direct listing, not an IPO, however that has no impact on the glitch. Direct listing just removes underwriting from the process.

Day Range: $208 - $221  
52 week low - $135  
Market Cap: $68bn

**At $68bn that gives DoorDash a larger market cap than the following companies:**

* Spotify ($SPOT)
* Palantir ($PLTR)
* Atlassian ($TEAM)
* Adidas ($ADDF)
* Workday ($WDAY)
* Autodesk ($ADSK)
* FedEx ($FDX)
* ....and $1 billion shy of having a larger market cap than Twilio ($TWLO)

**Lockup Expiration:**  
Looking at companies like Lemonade and Snowflake we can see that after an IPO and the employee stock lockup period ends, the markets tend to anticipate a pull back. For Doordash, this day is March 9th. There are some things that need to happen before the lockup is lifted however. DoorDash needs to be trading at 25% above IPO price for 5 days prior to this. The next one would be June 7, 2021.

With $DASH at the price it is today, hitting a high of $221, it's a safe bet to think that the lockup period will stand on March 9th. If the stock were to fall so drastically that the lockup period wouldn't go into effect....well you still win with puts because that means the stock fell \~$100 / share.

I have 25 puts for March 19, 2019 for a $170 strike. This cost me $21,817.50. I may add to this in the future, or buy more puts at a higher strike pending how the stock moves in the coming days / weeks.

DDOG - Earnings report coming.

I've read and become familiar with datadog, including it's last four quarters worth of results and their coming predictions for the fourth quarter of 2020. The earnings report is coming out after close today.

If you're unsure about what datadog do - they are a monitoring and security platform for cloud applications.

The hit of the pandemic wasn't really an issue for them - sure, technology companies and cloud providers are tightening their belts, but when everything is moving towards home-working, there is a serious requirement for cloud monitoring and security when your business is becoming more de-centralized, a reality that creates more attack vectors for businesses.

This all points to good news for datadog, but they are still waiting for secure approval from federal level, which comes with quite the boost some cloud providers would be seeking.   

I have no doubt their revenue is probably about the level they predicted. A 5.3% increase from last quarter. The share price on the other hand has hit about 34% increase from the same time. The company is investing in rapid growth, with big spends in R&D. They're a great company and if you go long on this position then it will undoubtedly hit these numbers and above based on their GAAP, but at current I do not anticipate the earnings reports to shine anything that will justify this share price.",2021-02-12 01:59:13

Cloudflare earnings OVERNIGHT PLAY (Good 'ol fashioned DD),72,lhq2pa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhq2pa/cloudflare_earnings_overnight_play_good_ol/,102,1613094283.0,"While most of you degenerates have been trying to time pump-and-dumps, there's been some serious gains going on in Cloudflare ($NET). They are up almost 20% over the last week. Cloudflare is a world-renowned cloud computing company that offers services from cyber-security to content-hosting. It IPO'd at the end of 2019, and is already up over 500% in the last 12 months. Cloud services are expanding at an extremely rapid rate, and it's one of the tech industries that has massively benefitted from Covid-19, considering the increase in demand for cloud computing resources due to people spending time at home all day.

Cloudflare Q4 earnings report is **tonight**. There has been some serious whale buy volume in anticipating the earnings jump \[[source](https://imgur.com/a/h7hMTO3)\]. Almost every stock with a heavy hand in cloud computing (esp Amazon, Google, Microsoft) have destroyed their Q4 earnings report. Cloudflare is the biggest CDN provider, and one of, if not the, biggest DDOS and bot protection provider. They have a massive hand in the market and serve millions of businesses, from small to ultra-large corporations. \[[source](https://enlyft.com/tech/products/cloudflare)\]

They have outperformed their anticipated earnings, and last report drew over any 11% uptick after the Q3 earnings statement. A solid earnings report tonight could draw an extremely strong uptick in price, and I'm betting on it. Positions: 2/12 $89 c, 2/12 $90, 6/16 c$110

TLDR: This literally can't go tits up, overnight calls are a one way ticket all the way to tendietown.

**Ticker:** $DIS

**Market Cap:** 341.8 Billion

**Assets:** 201.5 Billion

**Subsidiaries:** Disney +, Pixar, Hulu, ESPN, FX, ABC, etc

First, Disney is a safe as fuck investment. It‚Äôs a blue chip and should be a part of your portfolio. But fuck portfolios, this is a casino, so why will Disney moon? Why the fuck does Disney need a DD? Well, I'm Long $DIS, but today will also make for a good earnings play. 

**Disney Plus.** Have you heard about it? Well, millennials with kids sure have. As the millenials start pumping out babies after 12 months of social distancing, they‚Äôll quickly learn kids get bored easily, and fast. Disney Plus will be as big as Netflix in a few years, and will probably eclipse it for multiple reasons. They have a huge library that they own themselves, and the ability to have streaming premiers, etc. Not to mention the package with Hulu and ESPN. Netflix has a market cap of around **250 billion** with only **40 billion** in assets and 1.5 Debt-to-Equity vs Disney 0.7

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm long Netflix too, but clearly $DIS is the better deal here when you consider their other revenue streams. The fucking rocketship that Disney Plus is has only just started getting priced in, and is where Netflix was 6-7 years ago, but with an accelerated course to get there since people already adopted streaming. They also own their own content and have been producing since their inception, and have a better moat than Netflix. Even if the revenue from Disney+ doesn't match Netflix, they'll be able to pull a bigger profit and recycle old IP. 

Oh, let's not get into sports. ESPN, Cricket, etc. Mickey already has his dirty paws in everything. More independent services to charge for. 

Their earnings have taken a hit from their parks and experiences being limited from COVID. But the vaccine is rolling out, and their peak profit from this is in the Summer, where COVID transmissibility tends to be low, and partying tends to be high. This will have a much less effect on earnings than predicted the parks get busier this year with vaccinated people ready to go HAM from a year of isolation. Their parks are operating at 35% capacity, but they aren't at capacity for the bulk of the year. Even if the parks take a significant hit this year, it won‚Äôt even be noticed as $DIS tears through hyperspace. Fuck the moon. We‚Äôre talking Star Wars^TM type intergalactic travel. üöÄ


**Revenue Streams**

Media Networks: 28.4 Billion

Parks/Experiences: 16.5 Billion

Studio Entertainment: 9.64 Billion

Other: 17 Billion

**Earnings Play**

As for an earnings play, they report today. This is a casino. They‚Äôre still holding low considering the uncertainty with their parks, but park travel is low in the winter, and should have a low effect on earnings. But while kids were home, not in school, and causing a ruckus, Disney + subs increased dramatically over the Fall. Look at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=disney%20plus) and notice the clear increase over Q4, probably fueled by the Mandalorian and the holiday classics people go nuts for.

Why a long-term short squeeze isn't possible,0,lhpkw7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhpkw7/why_a_longterm_short_squeeze_isnt_possible/,42,1613092988.0,"Thinking about all the craziness with GameStop stock over the past month made me think about how this is a great example of a real life game theory with the prisoner's dilemma.

So what is the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma?

‚ÄúThe prisoner's dilemma is a paradox in decision analysis in which two individuals acting in their own self-interests do not produce the optimal outcome. The typical prisoner's dilemma is set up in such a way that both parties choose to protect themselves at the expense of the other participant. As a result, both participants find themselves in a worse state than if they had cooperated with each other in the decision-making process. The prisoner's dilemma is one of the most well-known concepts in modern game theory.‚Äù (Investopedia)

Applying the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma to what happened with GameStop is relatively simple. The best-case scenario (based on the stated goal) is for everyone to work together and ‚Äúhold the line‚Äù. This keeps the price of GameStop high and forces the hedge fund managers to lose money covering their shorts. On the other hand, the worst-case scenario is if no one buys or everyone sells their positions in a short period of time. This resorts in the shorts still being profitable for the hedge funds and ultimately the little guy has no impact on the market. Now what really happens, and what did, is that tons of people bought and held in the beginning, which is what shot the stock price to the moon. Now after about two weeks people started to bail, which represents the other two scenarios in the prisoner‚Äôs dilemma. Where half of the party rats out the other half. With GameStop this is represented by some people starting to sell. The early sellers make most or all the profits leaving those who hold long term with a mostly worthless stock.",2021-02-12 01:23:08

I personally went in on some 4/16 220C that are currently trading for .80! If this thing returns back to 210-220 range, those calls will easily quadruple. Clorox had a 52 week high at almost $240!

Here‚Äôs a statement from the recent earnings call! 

It was said:

On an organic basis, Q2 sales grew 26%. I will now go through our results by segment. In our Health and Wellness segment, Q2 sales were up 42%, reflecting double digits increases in 2 of 3 businesses. Our Cleaning business had double-digit sales growth behind strong ongoing demand across our portfolio. Consumption remains high and, importantly, we're continuing to see increases in household penetration and repeat rates among existing and new users, driven by new routines developed from the prolonged pandemic as well as strategic brand investments.

I think it has a lot of upside potential!

The SEC has been active in the ""popular rebellion"" trading inspired by Robinhood among other sites. This appears to be the only relevant petition for comments. This is unfortunate. Some argue that these traders represent individual investors. This is clearly untrue. Individual investors these days invest primarily through mutual funds (e.g., Vanguard's $7billion holdings) and are strongly negatively affected by the stock market declines attributed largely to increasing volatility driven by the ""popular rebellion"" traders.

Understanding The Market Requires You To Understand Market Psychology

Check out my profile for stock Analysis by request.

Stock market intraday patterns ‚Äì all times are in Eastern Standard Time!

When day trading the US stock market you may notice certain patterns, based on the time of day, that occur more often than not. These patterns, or tendencies, happen often enough for professional day traders to base their trading around them.

9:30am: The stock market opens, and there is an initial push in one direction. Highly volatile!

9:45am: The initial push often sees a significant reversal or pullback. This is often just a short-term shift, and then the original trending direction re-asserts itself.

10:00am: If the trend that began at 9:30am is still happening, it will often be challenged around this time. This tends to be another time where there is a significant reversal or pullback.

11:15am-11:30am: The market is heading into lunch hour, and London is getting ready to close. This is when volatility will typically die out for a few hours, but often the daily high or low will be tested around this time. European traders will usually close out positions or accumulate a position before they finish for the day. Whether the highs or lows are tested or not, the markets tend to ‚Äòdrift‚Äô for the next hour or more.

11:45am-1:30pm: This is lunch time in New York, plus a bit of a time buffer. Usually, this is the quietest time of the day, and often, day traders like to avoid it.

1:30pm-2:00pm: If the lunch hour was calm, then expect a breakout of the range established during lunch hour. Often, the market will try to move in the direction it was trading in before the lunch hour doldrums set in.

2:00pm-2:45pm: The close is getting closer, and many traders are trading with the trend thinking it will continue into close. That may happen, but expect some sharp reversals around this time, because on the flip side, man traders are quicker to take profits or move their trailing stop losses closer to the current price.

\---

3:00pm-3:30pm: These are big ‚ÄúShake-out‚Äù points, in that they will force many traders out of their positions. If a reversal of the prior trend occurs around this time, then the price is likely to move very strongly in the opposite direction. Even if the prior trend does sustain itself through these periods, expect some quick and sizable counter-trend moves.

As a day trader, its best to be nimble and not get tied into one position or direction. Many traders only trade the first hour and the last hour of every day, as these times are the most volatile.

3:30pm-4:00pm: The market closes at 4pm. After that, the liquidity dries up in nearly all stocks and ETFs, except for the very active ones. It‚Äôs common to close all positions a minute or more before the closing bell, unless you have orders placed to close your position on a closing auction or ‚Äúcross‚Äù.

Trade Entry Checklist - Things to Consider before entering a trade

1. Portfolio fit ‚Äì Make sure you diversify your portfolio. If you have 9 open bullish positions, consider a bearish stance elsewhere to balance your portfolio and reduce risk.
2. Liquidity Check ‚Äì If the stock you are considering has enough stocks traded per day. This can easily be found on Yahoo! Finance ‚Äì look for ‚ÄúAverage Volume.‚Äù Look for contract strikes that have at least 1,000 contracts of open interest ‚Äì this minimizes bid/ask spread and ensures market liquidity so that you can actually enter/exit trades easily.
3. IV Percentile ‚Äì Example: AAPL has IV of 45%, but IV percentile of 85%. This means that 85% of the time over the last year, volatility will be lower than it is right now as it‚Äôs current actual IV (45%). Likewise, if GOOG has an IV of 45% but an IV rank of 25%, then only 25% of the time over the last year IV was lower than it‚Äôs current value (45%). This means we have a 75% chance that IV will increase on average, meaning it‚Äôs current volatility is low ‚Äì and we want to buy into that. If IV is between 70%-100% you will need to actively monitor that trade, higher risk.
4. Options strategy - Pretty straight forward- If IV is high and the price of the underlying is also high, we can eliminate bullish strategies and focus on bearish, and vice versa.
5. Strike Price ‚Äì First you need to determine if you want an in the money (ITM) or out of the money (OTM). An ITM option has a greater sensitivity ‚Äì delta ‚Äì to the price of the underlying stock. So if the stock price increases by a given amount, the ITM call would gain more than an ATM or OTM call. This also means it would decline more than others if the price falls. ITM calls are more expensive as well ‚Äì higher intrinsic value.

Next consideration is risk/reward. An ITM option carrier less risk, but costs more. If you only want to stake a small amount of capital in a trade, an OTM position may be your best choice. OTM positions are riskier, cheaper, and potentially much more profitable if the stock surges past your strike price.

6. Expiration ‚Äì Date similarly to strike price, the further out a contracts expiration is, the higher the premium because time is on your side. There is a higher chance of the stock meeting your OTM target price given a year to do so, compared to a week. This is called Theta ‚Äì a quantification of how much value is lost due to the passing of time. Theta also grows exponentially as you near the expiration date ‚Äì your $190 strike call will be worth very little if the call expires tomorrow and the stock is at $180 because the probability of the stock reaching $190 is low.

7. Position size ‚Äì This is important ‚Äì BIG TRADING POSITIONS WILL EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE YOUR RISK OF BLOWING UP YOUR ACCOUNT. We suggest you place trades utilizing only 1-5% of your total account value, with an emphasis on the lower end. Play it safe, round down. It‚Äôs much easier to recover from a -5% loss than -80%.

8. Future moves ‚Äì Think beyond what‚Äôs going on with a stock than just in the current day ‚Äì unless youre scalping. Is there an earnings report coming up? Can I roll this into the next month if I need to? Is there an upcoming dividend payout? Take the time to plan your positions and don‚Äôt rush your entry ‚Äì You want to ensure the best possibility of success.

H&R Block is one of the largest tax firms in the world. They specialize in assisting individuals and businesses with paying their taxes. Their target market is primarily young people (age 20-24) who aren‚Äôt familiar with paying their taxes. Sounds like a lot of you apes, right? ü¶ç 

Anyway, the US government is expecting to open the tax season on February 12th, which is tomorrow. Because of an unprecedented number of young traders entering the market this past year, capital gains taxes among H&R Block‚Äôs target market is expected to be extremely high. (AKA the 18 year olds on the subreddit who made $20,000 on GameStop and weed stocks.)

H&R Block has traded as high as $37 back in 2015, and I‚Äôm expecting it to top that in the next few weeks. Furthermore, it pays a dividend yield of 5.28%, so the boomers are also interested in it. In my view, we‚Äôre looking at a perfect storm for H&R Block, and the earnings from this tax season will likely be heftier than most people recognize. 

TL;DR : young people who made money trading stocks and don‚Äôt know how to pay taxes will go to H&R Block. Stonk goes up, everybody happy.",2021-02-12 00:57:04

This isn't some kind of socialism or collective we vs them thing. ""paper hands"" are the people who sell for a profit and leave people bags. Now depending on the situation, they might not leave bags, and people with diamond hands make more money. Sometimes, paper hands are right. 

That is because... drum roll... it's all about supply and demand. This is especially true in options, because they are zero-sum. That means someone will come out a loser.

Some (RAD) Rite Aid DD and Updates,27,lhop5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhop5b/some_rad_rite_aid_dd_and_updates/,20,1613090673.0,"Hello WSB back with an update on my Rite Aid play.  Up 50% from when I entered my positions yesterday and held through the dip early.  I think we will continue to see upward movement through the end of the month after the earlier movement this week.  

I am posting this again today as people thought it may be too late yesterday, but today is a great time to get in.


**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you‚Äôre saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It‚Äôs okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.


MORE PROMISING NUMBERS

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

**UPDATED INFO**

The biggest criticism I see of rite aid are its debt and the fact it is a drug store.  

As for the debt, I believe this is already priced in.  Even with the 3.5 billion in debt Rite aid is STILL UNDERVALUED BY A BILLION DOLLARS. 

As for rite aid being a drug store, they have recently partnered not only with HEB grocery but they also launched their telehealth to generate additional revenue. 


Tl;DR: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result it‚Äôs STILL fundamentally undervalued.

BB/AMZN Speculation: Blackberry IVY for the automotive industry is just a cover. We are thinking too small.,970,lhooz1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhooz1/bbamzn_speculation_blackberry_ivy_for_the/,295,1613090664.0,"175 million cars currently runs on BlackBerry QNX blah blah yada yada we‚Äôve all read a hundred DDs on why BB is going to dominate the EV software market and IVY is gonna collect harvest boatloads of data which BB can sell for a pretty penny. 

But think about it. 

Like, wrinkly-brain think about it.

Amazon doesn‚Äôt build cars or sell car insurance so what the hell do they really want out of this Blackberry partnership?

The answer is drones. Lots of drones. Our cities will be swarming with delivery drones in the near future, and Amazon needs a way to:

1. Control a vast network of drones that can delivery 2+ billion parcels per year 

2. Prevent them from running into other drones/evtols/planes/vehicles 

3. Prevent them from being hijacked by hackers and demonstrate to the government that their millions of drones are safe and secure (Blackberry has highest security rating)

4. Collect live data from the drones for package tracking, delivery times estimation , route optimization etc (IVY)

Andy Jassy, the current CEO of Amazon Web Services, will be taking over as CEO of Amazon in Q3. The same Andy Jassy from this article about BlackBerry IVY:

‚ÄúAWS and BlackBerry are making it possible for any automaker to continuously reinvent the customer experience and transform vehicles from fixed pieces of technology into systems that can grow and adapt with a user‚Äôs needs and preferences,‚Äù said Andy Jassy, CEO of Amazon Web Services, Inc. ‚ÄúThrough this joint effort with BlackBerry, we will provide automakers with the insights, capabilities, agility, and speed they need to thrive in an increasingly connected world. As automakers seek to race ahead in their digital transformations, BlackBerry IVY empowers them to build their brands and set the standard for connected vehicle services across the automotive industry.‚Äù

Blackberry IVY isn‚Äôt just some pet project for Amazon‚Äôs incoming CEO. It is quite possibly their MOST important project. Drone Delivery means that your Amazon Orders can get to you in MINUTES rather than days, and that they can come to YOU based on your GPS location instead of just your home or work address. 

Amazon‚Äôs plans for drone delivery is no secret, but always seemed like a far-flung future kinda thing. Until now. 

There must be a reason why Jassy of all people was chosen to take the helm at Amazon. What can he bring to Amazon that he isn‚Äôt already bringing from his current position as head of AWS?

TLDR: Drones and Amazon‚Äôs domination of urban airspace

The Snakes and the Wall the Fish Built - Path to the Moon Part 4,19,lhoko4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhoko4/the_snakes_and_the_wall_the_fish_built_path_to/,17,1613090333.0,"Once upon a time a bunch of Snakes decided a **Game** was **going to** have to **Stop**.

A clever deep sea fish convinced a bunch of **Retarded Fish** to **build a wall** to stop those pesky Snakes from stopping the game.

The **Snakes did not like this** one bit, they could not have walls being built without their permission, so **they did all they could to bring it down**. First they stopped the Fish from getting more bricks. Then they moved bricks between themselves which made the wall smaller. The Snakes were crafty motherfuckers and they had been **playing games with walls for a very long time.** This led to **an impasse** where the Retarded Fish would build up the Wall while the Snakes would tear it down. It looked like this could go on for a very long time.

Along came a Snail, a very clever Snail and in this reality the Retarded Fish listened to his idea. It was hard for them at first, being Retarded Fish but eventually they listened and **they took their own wall down** at his advice.

Suddenly a magical thing happened\*\*.\*\* The **Snakes thinking they had won** stopped moving stones between each other. They **had no wall to tear down.** They gave each other pats on their scaly backs. However the **Snakes** now **knew** that **the wall** the **fish** had tried to **build was popular**. They knew that the **fish might try again** to build the wall. The Snakes knew that if the fish should build the wall again it would be **better for them to make some prophets off of it**.

See the **Snakes had no interest** in the wall **the first time** it was being built, they had **an interest in taking it down**. Once the wall had been taken down and their losses recouped they had **no business in seeing the Game Stop completely**. Snakes like building walls even more than Retarded Fish.

**Now the Snakes had a vested interest in seeing the wall built**, as they could easily cover their positions from a low level, their was **nothing to stand in the way of the Retarded Fish.** Magically after following Snails advice, **the Snakes were now helping** the Retarded Fish build the Wall. The Retarded Fish went and got more Fish. Family Fish, Friend Fish. **Every Fish and Every Snake joined in** building this wall.

Each day **the Wall grew higher** and higher and very quickly it **reached the moon**. The Snakes were on the Moon, the Retarded Fish were on the Moon, all their Family and Friend Fish were on the Moon. **Everyone now had an interest in seeing the wall built. There was nothing to take it down.** They all lived happily ever after Rich as Fuck on the Moon.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice, nor is it a true story. Unfortunately Retarded Fish are **too stupid to know good advice when they see it**. Too close they are to read the writing on the wall. It says ""stand back, stop holding and **do what ever the fucking Snail tells you**."" So simple it could have been to reach the moon but for the stubbornness of Retarded Fish.

I am joycey-mac-snail

My name is **LEONIDAS**

**I AM KING** 

**I AM YOUR WIFE'S BOYFRIEND**

When this is over you will beg me to take her from you. You are all **Kings and Queens in your own right**  but you don't act like it. You act like Retarded Fish.

&#x200B;

Edit: TLDR for you fucking retards. **NONE OF YOU SHOULD BE ANYWHERE NEAR THE STOCK MARKET IF YOU CAN'T READ A FUCKING CHILDRENS STORY.**

It's simple, bring the wall down and the Snakes will stop tearing it down. When you start building again, the Snakes will be helping you all to build it high.

High enough to reach the moon.

Has been on a constant uphill trend for the past month.

Up 10.68% this week and 44.65% this month. 

ViacomCBS has its investor day on February 21st and just like Disney+ I expect them to increase share price exponentially. 

For those who don‚Äôt know ViacomCBS - VIAC is the stock for the new releasing streaming service Paramount+ (I know ‚ÄúAnOtHeR sTrEaMiNg SeRvIcE‚Äù, but this is different hear me out) 

Paramount+ will include mega Titans combing to create one of the top streaming services in the world. 

Viacom includes - Nickelodeon, MTV, VH1, ‚≠êÔ∏èBET, C M T, Comedy Central, and Paramount Network.

CBS has - CBS All-Access, Showtime, and live Sports & News. (CBS sponsored the super bowl this year, it also host the PGA WorldTour, March madness, and the biggest college football games out of the SEC)

On top of that Pluto Tv has also joined them. Pluto TV Provides television to lower income house holds and is free television that makes its revenue off of ads.

Paramount Pictures has a huge collage of movies and they also own 49% of Miramax which adds hundreds and even up to thousands of other options. These movies are timeless from Transformers, The Godfather, Wolf of Wallstreet, Mission Impossible, Star Trek, etc. 

On top of that Paramount was a huge part of creating Netflix and Hulu originals we all love. (13 Reasons Why, Tom Clancy‚Äôs Jack Ryan, Defending Jacob)

The stock has only been moving up the past couple months and after their investor day I expect them to make a killing and finally place themselves up there with Netflix and Disney+

Investor day - February 21st

Earnings - February 24th 

Paramount+ streaming release date - March 4th

This streaming outlet is in a whole different position then all the rest. It‚Äôs live TV / Sports mixed in with timeless TV shows and movies. I personally believe if they live up to their word this could be revolutionary and also could put the Nail in the coffin for Cable TV.

JUST WAIT

Once these companies get uplisting onto the NASDAQ , and become available on Robinhood, a lot of people will begin to realize the staggering revenue difference between US operators and Canadian ones that already exists. As we seem to be trending toward legalization in the US, time is slowly running out to get in but it‚Äôs far from too late.

There will be a pullback in the sector as a whole soon as the hype dies down again which will make the opportunity even JUICIER.

My favorites are the etf MSOS (only thing available on Robinhood that gives users a portion of US companies), which holds operators like TCNNF, GTBIF (first public offering was just bought by blackrock for $100 million), CURLF, and GRAMF (a Jay-Z and Rihanna backed company that off the star power alone may have a ton of room to grow)

Because it did and no doubt there was a great bit of excitement. 

But if you look at what's going on this week as far as volume goes, it has gone down. It seems like the stock is going to move much more slowly with a lot less investors with interest. Lots of big players exited their positions already and probably aren't looking to buy back in anytime soon. 

Those who are holding see a short squeeze as on the horizon. They see dollar signs. But how realistic is that really? We keep getting information that the next report is around the corner and the shorts will be revealed as being in a bad position. 

It hasn't happened. It may not happen. And many of you are slowly losing interest. 

This subreddit is called WallStreetBets for a reason. We make bets. Very rarely does the great group hold shares for a long period of time. Those of you who have Gamestop options expiring soon probably are sweating. And you should be. 

The point I have to make is, anyone still in Gamestop, why? You could be making so much more money elsewhere. Those who saw the signs and moved to weed stocks made a bundle. Now, granted most were in before the latest weed run up, but the momentum traders among you still made a good bit of coin. Obviously the weed craze won't last forever, but if you momentum trade like the majority of the group here, you'd be in and out with profit. 

The long and short of it is, your money could be better spent elsewhere, even if elsewhere is on YOLOs for options that are far OTM. 

The original theory on Gamestop may have been moving in the right direction, but where are we now? We're at a stock that's pretty low volume, trading pretty flat, or downward depending on your perspective, on the way to a sub billion dollar market cap. 

I think all of our money can be better spent somewhere else. On options. Far OTM. Expiring at the end of next week.",2021-02-12 00:33:53

It‚Äôs fine to ride the train up, but please for the love of god, set a stop limit or a trailing stop. I‚Äôve been apart of this community for over a year but just started investing. I‚Äôm going to give the new people some advice.

1. Research the company and see if their valuation matches the current share price. 

2. Pay close attention to all the comments on whatever you‚Äôre investing in. It‚Äôs not hard to tell the real people from bots. Most bots will tell you to hold the fucking bag, while they run off with your money. 

3. If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it usually is. I‚Äôm not telling anyone how to spend there money, but please only invest in these high volatility stocks with the future of the share possibly tanking. 

4. Don‚Äôt let high volatility stocks take up a majority of your portfolio. I‚Äôve seen advice where people say one stock shouldn‚Äôt take up more than 10-20% of your portfolio. 

5. This one is a big one. If you see people hyping the fuck out of a certain stock, there is a good chance there will certainly be a sell off once people start seeing huge profits. It don‚Äôt hurt to take profit and buy in at a lower price. Definitely use risk management to make sure every trade is worth it. 

6. Don‚Äôt day trade, you will lose more money than you make in the long run. If you plan on investing short term, have a strategy. Invest in options that have good deltas and IV. These are certainly risky but if you like gambling on shitty shilled stocks, this one is for you. 

7. If you want to go long, invest in ETFs. Sure these will see lower gains, but over time the gains will be decent. If you want to go long on equities, make sure you love the damn stock. So many people see red and sell, this is fine if you‚Äôre using risk management and need to exit but horrible if you‚Äôre trying to make money without a lot of capital. 

8. Learn, Learn, and Learn. Learn from every mistake you make and better yourself for the next trade. I was a bag holder with GME, I lost about $600. Know which indicators lead to the stock moving in a certain directions. You think it will breakout, what will the catalyst be? Always strive to learn more than the previous day. 

TLDR: Trust your instincts, not random people on Reddit, who a majority are bots and shills. You can definitely learn from people on here, but you‚Äôre picking a needle from a haystack. You‚Äôre here to make money for your future, other people are wanting to fill their pockets, so expect misinformation. Take everything with a grain of salt.",2021-02-12 00:32:57

The answer was ""we smoke weed and its a momentum play"". Ok, but why not go with a company that has even more future growth ahead, already profitable, fortress balance sheet, cash out the ass, and great marketing ? When you make moves on an undervalued company, you get a huge margin of safety compared to being randomly retarded.

Valens is focused on oil based products and extraction. They do the extraction for all your fav companies including Tilray and Sundial. As those companies grow, they use Valens more for extraction. Valens benefits from everyone's rise as their premier oil extractor.

(Valens) (VLNS on TSX) VLNCF's revenue is 98M with market cap of 220M; OGI‚Äôs revenue is 80M with market cap of 1.3B; SNDL‚Äôs revenue is 97M with market cap of 4.4B. Thus, VLNCF‚Äôs SP should be between $10 and $35.

How does that make sense?

105 Million is short term assets vs 22 M in short term liabilities and only 30 mill in long term. Clearly got cash. In fact too much cash since investors were upset recently with the company raising more money. They believe it was unnecessary and the stock price dropped. I believe they did it to acquire a key partner. When this announcement hits, it will all make sense.

Valens. 88% yearly earnings growth according to 8 analysts. Current price 2.10$ cad, analysts target is 3.61. Recently fell down because they raised more money they didnt need.

Simply Wall St rates them 91% undervalued with a target price of 27.40$. That seems pretty excessive to me though. My target price is 6-10$, which would make it only a 1 billion $ market cap.

They are entering the Australian market which is ripe. Read about their plans in their presentation: [https://thevalenscompany.com/investors/](https://thevalenscompany.com/investors/)

Insider buying: Last 6 months, the ceo, directors and board of directors made 6 purchases, and 0 sales.

The stock price is currently at a low so you get a huge margin of safety since you are not buying hype, but are buying undervalued. If there were options on this baby I will get them right away. Since there is not, I got stock.

With a large portfolio of brands, they have products at every price point from low to high-end, flower to topicals and a crap ton of money.

In the beginning of February, they announced the completion of a $0.75 public offering for a cool $100 milly. Simultaneously, they launched another offering. BuT tHaT's GoInG tO DiLuTe tHe MaRkEt! ThE sToCk HaS A 1 BiLlIoN dOlLaR fLoAt. Doesn‚Äôt that fucking suck? No, it doesn‚Äôt, and I‚Äôll tell you why: it‚Äôs good. 

These offerings allowed these guys to load up on mad cash and sky's the limit with this new found cash money 420 swag 69. They are sitting on something like $600+ milly. That is a lot of fucking money. So what are they going to spend it on? Acquisitions? Expansion? Whatever it is, I trust the fuck out of their management team. ""Sundial's current balance sheet and liquidity enable management to focus on delighting consumers while providing significant optionality to participate in North American consolidation,"" said Sundial's CEO, Zach George. Fuck yea George, delight me.

We saw some crazy movement last night and premarket this morning, potentially shorts covering some naked calls, as we saw a lot of call action at $1.50, $2, $2.50, and $3 this week.

Summary

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
The RKT ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù provides a ‚Äúfull cycle‚Äù solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it‚Äôs an app, it‚Äôs online, it‚Äôs doable from home and it‚Äôs not complicated. There‚Äôs an inherent advantage in what they‚Äôre doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that‚Äôs complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there‚Äôs a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they‚Äôre doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That‚Äôs a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That‚Äôs an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.
Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share.

This estimate gives a ttm P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, even compared to the financial/mortgage sector. What‚Äôs key here is, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups.

Let‚Äôs assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. That would put its fair value right now at $57.75 per share. I think it‚Äôs worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it‚Äôs really only worth whatever the market will pay for it.

Key Point - Catalysts

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I‚Äôm buying shares, I‚Äôm selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don‚Äôt know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

The Business

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

Home Financing

Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent ‚Äúpublic facing‚Äù part of the Rocket ecosystem.
Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as ‚Äúsupporting infrastructure‚Äù to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop.
Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The ‚Äúbusiness end‚Äù in my simple understanding of the world.
Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
Edison Financial - Basically the ‚Äúfront end‚Äù of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.
Home Sale and Search

Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it‚Äôs absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.
Auto & Personal Financing

Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.
Media

Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
Lower My Bills - this company is basically a ‚Äúportal‚Äù business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.
Services & Technology Development

Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
Rock Central - I will generalize this as ‚Äúbusiness support‚Äù. HR, administration, etc.
Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.
Recent Acquisitions

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 (https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they‚Äôre the ones leading that charge.

Management

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune‚Äôs ‚Äú100 Best Companies to Work For‚Äù list for 17 consecutive years.

Financials and Growth

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don‚Äôt want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here‚Äôs a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth.

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected.

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion.

That‚Äôs awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with $3.5B cash on hand. That‚Äôs great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They‚Äôll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don‚Äôt love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I‚Äôm not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It‚Äôs nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr

I don‚Äôt believe that fair value estimate for an instant, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it‚Äôs also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

Product Channels

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don‚Äôt lie:

Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)
The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

Current Market and outlook

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% (https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html)

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here‚Äôs some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

Which Cannabis Stocks?,26,lhn9q8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhn9q8/which_cannabis_stocks/,69,1613086787.0,"Relatively new to WSB thread so be gentle. I'm writing this to give everyone some research I've done on the pot industry. The purpose here is to educate and make smart decisions with your money. Whether that be long term growth or just pumping everything for the home run to the moon, you do you. Just make money folks.

We all know the cannabis industry is on the brink of legalization. There are so many companies out there. Some will survive and some won't. The overall goal is to deep dive into this to figure out which companies have an established footprint and the best chance to become the industry leaders (think of the AMZN or AAPL of the pot industry).

Anyway, here are some picks I've researched:

**$MJ - ETFMG Alternative Harvest ETF**If you're not interested in trying to pick big winners but want exposure to the industry, MJ is probably the number one most active fund that spreads their portfolio out all over. Top holdings can be found here: [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/mj/holdings](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/fund/mj/holdings)

**$PLNHF - Planet 13 Holdings Inc**  
Cannabis company based out of Nevada. For those who have been to Vegas, they have the largest dispensary in the world. Not only do they have an established footprint in retail, but they have the ability to expand and deploy and already successful business model with a $1.6B market cap.

**$CXXIF - C21 Investments**  
Competitor to Planet 13 Holdings in NV. Many Cannabis ETFs are continuing to purchase more shares since this is company is relatively undervalued compared to its peers. They have large amounts of free cash and recently brought in some high profile investment managers.

**$TLRY - Tilray**  
Canadian pharmaceutical and cannabis company that recently announced a $3.9B merger with Aphria ($APHA) to become the world's largest production and distribution company in the industry. They've also agreed to start exporting to the UK, giving them access to a much larger customer base.

**$TCNNF - Trulieve Cannabis Corp.**  
\*\*One of the top performing cannabis companies in the United States. They recently opened a third dispensary in Jacksonville, FL, bringing their total footprint to 73 locations in Florida. Similar to Planet 13, this company has most of their presence on the east coast.

**$CRON - Cronos Group**  
Cronos Group engages in the production and distribution of pot. I consider this one of the safest bets since it based by Altria, the tobacco giant that holds 45% of the company. They've posted consistent, solid earnings and continue to look into lab grown opportunities to reduce costs and become more efficient.

TL;DR - These are some of the most popular weed stocks that offer you idiots to expose yourselves to the legalization of marijuana. They have the best chance to continue massive growth as opposed to picking the next penny stock.

Edit: had to edit $C21 to correct ticker $CXXIF. This one is the only one that didn't have a massive pullback today.",2021-02-11 23:39:47

"Why $MOR is a high IQ play in 2021. BioTech, Cancer, Inflammatory Diseases. DD Inside. üöÄ",10,lhn7uf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhn7uf/why_mor_is_a_high_iq_play_in_2021_biotech_cancer/,34,1613086637.0,"**Disclaimer: This is not financial advice.**

**General:** 

During a pandemic both government spending and private investing lead to an increase in market value among the health and research sector. There are a lot of companies in those sectors that are worth investing in, but upon closer inspection, there‚Äôs a subcategory that looks even more promising: Biotech. This branch combines both health and research. You might have heard the names of the most well-known representatives like Biontech and Pfizer. Both are playing an important role in the distribution of vaccines. But even seen independently of the current pandemic, Biotech will probably gain an indispensable status with regard to yet incurable diseases like cancer, autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. 

**Introducing MorphoSys:**

Market Cap: 3.759B

MorphoSys is an important developer of biopharmaceutical drugs. The company focuses on cancer as well as inflammatory diseases. However, the company focuses not only on pharmaceutical research itself, but also on the development of intelligent solutions and infrastructure, a major advantage compared to f. e. Biontech, where the lack of those lead to a lot of critique and problems, in regards to the distribution of the vaccine. MorphoSys already has two approved products on the market and three proprietary antibodies. The company is broadly positioned with their technology platforms in the market and also licenses them out to academic institutions and biopharmaceutical companies for research. Therefore MorphoSys is a multi-talented company that is both a software and a research company. In addition, MorphoSys already has approved compounds that provide the company with a financial cushion.

**The numbers:**

MorphoSys was able to show revenues of EUR 48.2M in the first half of 2019. However, this multiplied to EUR 269.7M in the first half of 2020. (These figures are in euros, as I took them from MorphoSys's German balance sheets). Losses turned from EUR -28.5M in the first half of 2019 to profits of EUR 179.8M in the first half of 2020.

**Conclusion:**

MorphoSys is a heavily undervalued company right now. The approaches the company is taking are similar to those of its chinese counterpart Wuxi Biologics. MorphoSys owns software that combines research and development while contracting it out to others. In doing so, the company is one of very few others that is working on autoimmune/inflammatory diseases in addition to cancer, effectively covering a gap in the market and creating a unique selling point.

GME was a game. Weed is an artificially inflated bubble. There is a much better opportunity to make money and help society at the same time.,71,lhmw52,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhmw52/gme_was_a_game_weed_is_an_artificially_inflated/,205,1613085730.0,"I am an economist and a psychologist, I've been on reddit forever, and I've always been a market index etf/hold type of investor (optimal balance of risk/reward) so I had no use for subreddits like r/wallstreetbets in the past.

With all the noise bubbling up about GME, I was curious to see what's up.   My take on what's going on:

GME:  Let's get real.  It's a doomed brick and mortar game company.  Boosting it was fun, but it's ultimately artificial and we all know we're unlikely to hand more and more of our personal dollars over to Gamestop in the coming years even if they come up with some kind of competent online strategy (it's laughable we're still waiting on that this late in the game).  Sorry if you're holding the bag, but there's no point.  The company doesn't have legs.

Weed: This is a legitimate industry with very predictable, steady long term growth as more markets come online with easing laws and regs.   It's not going to grow much more in existing markets.  Weed is just weed.   You can only consume so much, and it's easy to get sick of it.   It has some limited medical uses, but it's not about to surprise us.   IOW, the long term growth potential is all priced in.   Boosting it was fun, but ultimately pointless, WSB has generated another bubble.  Don't get caught holding the bag here either.

Psychedelics:   Ok this is a real opportunity.   The research on psychedelics is astounding.  It's effective in novel ways, providing profound relief from otherwise intractable conditions like major depressive disorder, and used in conjuction with therapy, is effective for helping people cope with PTSD, anxiety, and potentially many other emotional issues.   Unlike other medicines used to treat these conditions, it appears possible to deliver psychelic therapies with very minimal side effects.   As a psychologist, I am incredibly hopeful about the potential benefits it can bring with proper research and social acceptance.  As an economist, I see a world changing development that doesn't just boost the economy, but the well being of people as a whole.  Investing in pyschedics will actually help usher them into the mainstream, opening up more research opportunities and pushing back on the long-standing conservative stranglehold preventing us from discovering more about the potential for these drugs.  

In other words, it's good for a short term investment, it's great for long term investment, and it's a much more prosocial investment than say, tryiing to ""stick it to the big guys.""  I recommend the ETF PSYK, and the company MMEDF Mind Medicine (MindMed) Inc.   Both are great entry points.

Why hedge funds should fear $AMC & why their trolls will post here,244,lhm7ic,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhm7ic/why_hedge_funds_should_fear_amc_why_their_trolls/,210,1613083775.0,"TL/DR:  **November 10, 2021 Opening day for Ghostbusters Afterlife**

I'm not one for surprises so I put it right up there in the title as a big FU to all those betting against AMC right now.

I'd like to make something abundantly clear. AMC is is not going anywhere. Not only will they weather this storm and come out on top but there are companies like Sony and Columbia that are *banking on* the existence of a Box Office to recoup their investments in silver screen flix. I guarantee that right now there is Peter Venkman merchandise already sitting in warehouses waiting to hit the market (and likely gamestop stores, lol).

Now I'm not goig to sit here and do your research about Thanksgiving release date movies and Christmas etc... but you can bet that the entire movie industry is looking for COVID to be over just as much as the travel industry who's buying up island destination properties.

For everyone and anyone who's negative with AMC I'm wondering why on earth they'd take a loss versus waiting till the summer when this stock will easily exceed $20/share (IMHO of course). I see no reason to concede shares back to those who shorted them simply on principle.

If you'd like to do your own research about AMCs financials I suggest posts like [this one][https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lctc6u/i_cant_believe_how_many_people_are_more_retarted/]. While I can seem to find it, someone here had stats on what AMC makes off of MoviePass alone. Let's not let the media con us here. 

HOLDING STRONG.

Having said this, I wish everyone here good luck and good fortune and I will most definitely see you in-person @ Ghostbusters

($SPCE) WSB VS UBS: THE CASE FOR SPCE $2000,774,lhk1hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhk1hh/spce_wsb_vs_ubs_the_case_for_spce_2000/,317,1613076708.0,"TLDR - Pre-rev company Virgin Galactic has significant levers in the business model that are unaccounted for by the sell-side. Technical setup is good. Tons of catalysts in the short-term. Could see this trade to $100-200 on a successful test flight this weekend.

**What the Sell-side is Missing**

You know what the beauty of a pre revenue and a highly disruptive company is? The opportunities are endless and only limited by lack of imagination. Think TSLA early days. 

Yesterday, UBS downgraded SPCE because of its ""stratospheric stock move"", claiming  valuation ""appears full following a 100%+ gain since the start of the year"", while also upping valuation from $35/share to $52/share (aka we are at fair value according to the UBS). We have three things to say to UBS:

1) Virgin Galactic, along with Blue Origin and SpaceX, are the top players in an emerging industry, that has the potential to change the way we travel, communicate and harvest resources. 

2) The general investing public has limited understanding that they can invest in space via SPCE; and 

3) You don't hop off of the tendies train before getting to the station

Below we present our DCF showing how we could theoretically make the case for SPCE $2000. These are aggressive forecasts and Virgin Galactic would need flawless execution from here on out, but the possibilities are basically endless. Who knows what will happen in 10 years....UBS sure doesn't.

[Source: We = Me and your dad; not investment advice, do your own dd](https://preview.redd.it/pai22wzt6qg61.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e415773466aa75aed75a19cc6fea7680fc88355)

Here are some revenue drivers that are likely unaccounted for in sell-side models. Ordered from insane to most insane.

**Sub-orbital Pricing**

We expect sub-orbital ticket pricing to be much higher than the sell-side is anticipating. As of right now, the list price for a ticket is $250k...and we expect the first 2000 unencumbered flights to cost $2Mn+. Our rationale stems from Virgin Galactic's ""one small step"" program application where individuals signing up for the waiting list were prompted with options to select their preferred price range. There was a $1Mn+ ticket option and the company inferred in the application that tickets would likely go for $1Mn+. 

[SS2 approaching Space](https://preview.redd.it/s659l5tz9qg61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=2661e8ce927ead7d7cbe49484a72e93b3ba2d705)

**Hypersonic Travel**

This will be the most significant revenue driver in the near term if achieved. Hypersonic travel has the potential to upend the existing transatlantic/ultra-long-haul travel regime. We are talking Howard Hughes type stuff. LA to Tokyo in 2.5 hours....unreal. 

While management has remained tight lipped about its hypersonic program, we ultimately expect Virgin Galactic to acquire Boom Supersonic in a stock for stock deal at some point in the next year. We believe that this would speed up VG's go-to-market by three years, with service starting in 2025.

[VG Hypersonic mockup](https://preview.redd.it/3clhvjfrcqg61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8e321766d6163ddb0eda6b001b7c971e6138c5d)

[Boom Hypersonic mockup](https://preview.redd.it/oq2l07cwcqg61.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=ac6caf58a1c803949b5e7c0d8959827348ff466b)

**Satellite Launch Biz**

While we recognize that Richard Branson's other space company, Virgin Orbit, plays in this space, we would not rule out Virgin Galactic expanding into this business as well. Keep in mind, Richard Branson is a minority shareholder of VG and VG has a fiduciary duty to all shareholders. If Virgin Galactic could adapt its current infrastructure to implement satellite launch capabilities, we would expect them to pursue this business.

Our thoughts stem from: 1) Virgin Galactic's recent petition to the DOT and FAA for more use cases for its mothership, White Knight Two; and 2) White Knight Two was originally a dual purpose aircraft for both sub-orbital human travel and satellite launches.

[WK2 launching satellites](https://preview.redd.it/6l93144uoqg61.png?width=760&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b073ee4447586fd23d2b22b69dfb3d1931d2ff8)

**Consumer Division**

The only thing more disruptive to the automotive industry regime than electric vehicles is....flying vehicles. While we believe that SpaceX/Tesla will pioneer the technology, we expect VG to be a top three player if they pursue this opportunity. Again, this is futuristic but possible, and a long time coming. We believe our current revenue forecasts are conservative IF they are able to develop this technology. Again we, and UBS, have no idea what the world will look like in 10 years....so it's possible. VG has the IP and knowledge to be among the first-movers in this space.

**Space Mining**

Screw it, why not? With the environmental conservation push enveloping the globe, we could see mining on earth completely outlawed if humanity is able to exploit asteroid/lunar mining.

**SETUP/TECHNICALS**

Today will be a key day technically. UBS attempted to stop the tendies train with their downgrade yesterday, which caused a slight breaking of trend support. Fear not, we have seen this pattern before and could possibly break the resistance that we have been battling for the last two weeks. We believe we are in the oversold/consolidation phase similar to what we saw last month. We additionally note that by 2pm today the 200 hour moving average will be at current levels adding additional support to the uptrend.

[Hourly SPCE chart](https://preview.redd.it/npz8ggkigug61.png?width=1175&format=png&auto=webp&s=e97bc8f40b4f8dbb7c4acbf88111ec5ee9c8071e)

And if we pull a similar move to last year's parabolic move on a percentage increase basis, we could see SPCE at $136 in the n/t.

[SPCE weekly chart](https://preview.redd.it/kzc7y3c2aug61.png?width=990&format=png&auto=webp&s=01fda9fd8a31c02b845208e5e3b89b5e06372b67)

Additionally, hype is building quickly. As shown below, the SPCE subreddit sub count is reaching new highs everyday, which we expect to go parabolic should VG have a successful launch over the next week. Keep in mind, the general investing public is still not aware that SPCE exists and we expect broad public equity support after a successful launch.

[Subs on SPCE subreddit ](https://preview.redd.it/j1te6lykxtg61.png?width=857&format=png&auto=webp&s=da8725eec85da44a039b5617f284482929d6accc)

Last but not least...the **short interest data**. Virgin Galactic is currently one of the most heavily shorted US stocks with S3 recently noting that there is over $2Bn betting against VG.  We estimate SPCE's public float (ex-Virgin Group/SoCap/Aabar) at 60 million shares (60mn shares\*50 price=$3Bn). We therefore believe that \~70% of the float is short. Additionally, the call option wall is stacked, and any major movement on a successful launch will likely create the mother of all gamma/short squeezes.

**Upcoming Events**

Feb 12-16 - Spacex SN10 launches..spce usually trades as a proxy

Feb 13-18 - Virgin Galactic launches SS2

Feb 25 - Earnings report; we expect update on pricing + potential Boom acquisition

March - SS2 flight 2 and FAA approval

April - Ark Funds launches space etf 

April/May - Richard Branson goes to space

July+ -  Leonardo DiCaprio, Katy Perry, Justin Bieber go to space. 

**Main Risks**

1) Rocketship breaks

2) the company continues to work at snail's pace

3) Increasing competition

**Conclusion**

As we note in the title, this is a WSB vs UBS story. When UBS downgraded SPCE yesterday, while simultaneously raising their price target to fair value, we shook our heads and asked how is this even possible? Does anyone really know what the world will look like in 10 years...let alone a space company? So in response, we are here to show them that we run our own models and have our own thoughts on Virgin Galactic. Let this be a message to the sell-side from WSB....while ""you try to add value, we straight up create it"" if you know, you know. Strap in ladies and gents, SPCE is about to go on a wild ride.

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Thursday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/11/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-11-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to add to Wednesday‚Äôs record high close

> * Dow futures rose Thursday, one day after the 30-stock average hit an intraday all-time high in a volatile session and closed at a record. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Wednesday were unable to hold on to their all-time intraday highs and closed slightly lower.

> * The Labor Department is out at 8:30 a.m. ET with its weekly report on new jobless claims. Economists expect 760,000 filings for new unemployment benefits for last week. That would be down 19,000 from the prior week, which at 779,000 was the lowest initial claims reading since late November.

> * Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday monetary policy needs to stay ‚Äúpatiently accommodative‚Äù to support the economy that still faces challenges in the labor market. The employment picture is ‚Äúa long way‚Äù from where it needs to be, the central bank chief told the Economic Club of New York.

*****

> # 2. PepsiCo beats expectations; Uber delivers mixed results

> * Earnings were once again a focus for investors. Disney leads the list of major companies reporting quarterly results after Thursday‚Äôs closing bell. Before the market opening, PepsiCo reported a fourth-quarter profit of $1.47 per share, a penny better than estimates. Revenue rose 8.8% to $22.46 billion, also exceeding expectations. PepsiCo shares fell slightly in the premarket.

> * Uber shares dropped 4% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after the company reported a smaller-than-expected loss of 54 cents per share in the fourth quarter. However, revenue fell 16% to a lower-than-expected $3.17 billion. Uber‚Äôs ride-hailing business slowly recovered, while its delivery business boomed.

*****

> # 3. Cannabis stocks jump in a Reddit-fueled trade reminiscent of GameStop

> * Cannabis stocks were soaring as the Reddit crowd that spiked GameStop jumped in. Tilray shares surged nearly 51% on Wednesday, pushing the stock to a year-to-date gain of more than 670%. Not nearly as bet-against as GameStop, Tilray‚Äôs short interest was still equal to 22.5% of the shares available for trading, according to FactSet as of the end of January. Tilary added another 10% in Thursday‚Äôs premarket. Tilray is no stranger to a short-squeeze rally. The stock spiked more than 1,400% between July and September 2018, but those gains did not last.

*****

> # 4. Dating app firm Bumble set to begin trading after pricing IPO

> * When 31-year-old Bumble CEO Whitney Wolfe Herd takes her dating app company public Thursday, she‚Äôll be noted not only for her youth but also as one of the few female founders to lead her firm to an IPO. Bumble, whose board comprises 73% women, priced its offering Wednesday evening at $43 per share, raising $2.2 billion and valuing Bumble at around $8 billion. The stock market response will act as a litmus test for companies founded by women, who account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEOs. That‚Äôs an all-time high but still a staggeringly low.

I can't light up LIDAR"", and your right, you can't. But LIDAR is the key tech that will make automotive cars go vroom vroom, and MVIS has the best version of it.

Here's a little history on the company: üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Used to be part of of a university, then spun off into its own thing.

Traded pretty flat for a while as the team continued to work on their product.

They won the Microsoft Hololens 2 project and are an integral part of what make it work (makes VR go VRoom too) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

For the past 2 years they have been working on their state of the art Long range automotive LIDAR sensors with a planned full demonstration in April.

They released news yesterday AH that they are set to meet and exceed those specs üöÄüöÄüöÄ

In a nutshell, they appear to be a classic case of incredible tech that lacks good marketing and PR. If you look at a comparable company (LAZR), MVIS should have a valuation at least closer to 5B but more likely 10B, which means another 3x to move.

TL;DR MVIS has best tech üöÄüåïüöÄMVIS undervalued üöÄüåïüöÄ MVIS go to moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Here is some more DD from u/whodisdani 

Alright guys, sorry for the late reply I gave my very best as I do this one of the first times ... maybe I am approaching this wrongly or interpreting this wrongly.

reporting back from my research: first of all I am not an accountant / economics student (I am an software engineering student who had a little bit of accounting, gave my very best to analyse the stuff) maybe if someone could double check (will link the infos and datasources):

the company made -94 millions in the last year, hence quite a bit away of being break even. In 2020 in comparison to their previous years their revenue operating revenue fell over 50%. This seems to be a covid related issue. In the last two quarters of 2020 they had some income, however, still far from profitable.

‚Äã

I tried to break this down into this new 180 day device thing you mentioned, since I had no idea what this is, I went reading into this.

So I created the following calculation (I may be completely off, if so, say this pls): SENS reported that with their new alliance with Ascenia, they will be able to launch the product in Europe. With their operation revenues of 10'016'000 they have approximately 101'000 customers (based on a product price of 99.-). If they are able to expand again (as they did over the last few years) their operating revenue in the US would look something like this (I took the quarterly data, removed the huge spikes and this gave me something of a growth rate like this)

:

Q1 2021	Q2 2021	Q3 2021	Q4 2021
11'531'000	13'087'000	14'853'000	16'857'000
This would lead to an increase in market share of SENS from 0.3% to 0.5%.

Calculation market share SENS:

Country	Diabetes	Product cost	Operating revenue	Customers	Market share
USA 12.2020	30'000'000	99	10'016'000	101'000	0.3%
USA 12.2021	30'000'000	99	16'857'000	170'000	0.5%
‚Äã

I tried to consider the expansion into the European countries as well, with the same market share as in the US.

‚Äã

Country	Diabetes	Product cost	Operating revenue	Customers	Market share
Switzerland	500'000	99	250'000	2'500	0.5%
Germany	9'500'000	99	4'700'000	47'500	0.5%
Italy	3'300'000	99	1'630'000	16'500	0.5%
Netherland	1'300'000	99	640'000	6'500	0.5%
Poland	2'300'000	99	1'130'000	11'500	0.5%
Spain	3'600'000	99	1'780'000	18'000	0.5%
‚Äã

With this kind of growth, the operating revenue would nearly triple from this year to the end of next year. However, I have no idea if I have done stuff correctly, nor does this have any scientific value. As I said, I did not study anything related to stocks.

Thoughts on $CME - potentially undervalued?,132,lhhgyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhhgyf/thoughts_on_cme_potentially_undervalued/,51,1613065897.0,"I was on clubhouse and someone mentioned $CME as a potentially big opportunity. I did some research and agree that this could be a big win. Here are my thoughts .  


The CME Group ($CME) is a U.S. based global market company whose subsidiaries include; Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, New York Mercantile Exchange, The Commodity Exchange, as well a 24.4% stake in the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC.  


Yesterday the bears had a field day with $CME resulting in nearly a ten-point drop from the previous days high. The 3.5% drop put the price at $185.20 as of the markets close; this is despite a surprise increase in earnings and a marginal decrease in year over year.   


$CME is currently trading 40 points below its 225 high last February and has a market cap of $66B. However, the company's total assets exceed $117B ($35B more than the previous year) and shareholder equity is approximately 40% of the current market price at $26B.  


This alone is enough for me to believe that the stock is undervalued. By comparison, $AMZN's asset to market cap comes in at 13.55% and their shareholders equity is a mere 5.6%.  


This analysis is strictly quantitative and doesn't account for some very important qualitative aspects that could be cause the stock to rally. ¬†  


As many of you degenerates already know the CME group has created some exciting new futures and options that I cannot mention here but feel free to google it!  


Another important factor to consider is the massive $1.9T stimulus that is slated to make its way to the people over the coming weeks and months. As we have already seen from the previous covid stimulus payments - there will be a significant increase in retail investment more specifically an increase in options and futures trading and $CBE will probably be a major beneficiary due to it\&#039;s subsidiaries.  


In conclusion, I think this is a great opportunity for us . Time to add more diamonds to our hands bois. Let me know your thoughts and what the best play would be?",2021-02-11 17:51:37

* In Europe **Lilium** is doing their own way up from Munich. **Volocopter** too, but in a different way, already flying in Asia for testing. None are public and I think they will not be in a short term.
* **Joby** has done over 1000 test flights and it is the most advanced in all this certification problem with the FAA. It has launched an office in Munich too.
* **Ehang** from China is doing their own way, no idea how they will deal with the FAA and EASA, but China is big enough to have their own business over there if they are not accepted in our countries.
* **Airbus** and **Boeing** are late for this change as old fashion automakers are for the electric cars. To big to change the direction of their businesses, although both of them have their own program. Airbus a bit more ahead than Boeing, although none of them achieved major milestones.

So the idea of having a public company within EEUU with a higher probability of being accepted in Europe is a great opportunity.

DLB and why it is undervalued for what it does,38,lhgpwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhgpwj/dlb_and_why_it_is_undervalued_for_what_it_does/,43,1613062739.0,"What‚Äôs good fellow gamblers, degenerates, quaalude parachuters, and newbies.

It‚Äôs ya boy, ElJefe here and I am here to share with you how Dolby is an undervalued and often overlooked company that actually has more potential than meets the eye.

Dolby‚Äôs most recent earnings from their fiscal 1st quarter showed a strong YoY total revenue increase of 33.57% ($389.9 million, compared to $291.9 million). Where it gets interesting is that their cost of products and services decreased by 10.47%, their cost of revenue decreased by 5.39%, and this resulted in a 39.28% **increase** in their gross margin. They were also able to shave 7.8% off their operating expenses while increasing their operating income by **239%**. Their  Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share increased from 0.64 to 1.48.

**Dolby is thickly cash heavy.**

They make most of their money from licensing its audio technologies to broadcasters, television OEMs, computer manufacturers, gaming console companies, and cell phone makers. With royalty‚Äôs being 95% of their revenue, this is a strong business model that is able to create steady cash flow.

Their numbers are impressive and if you want to take a further look you can dive in here https://investor.dolby.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dolby-laboratories-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2021-financial.

**Dolby Vision** and **Dolby Atmos** have been extremely popular and are used in Broadcast, Mobile, Consumer Electronics, PC, Cinema. Think of the amount of TV‚Äôs, smartphones, home stereos, etc that are being sold that use these two technologies. Consider the recent iPhone ‚Äúsuper cycle‚Äù as one example to put into perspective how many devices will be using Dolby‚Äôs technology. Also consider that the demand for premium home entertainment has increased due to people spending more time at home. One other thing is that there is a higher demand from e-commerce platforms for audience-engaging content, which is increasing sales of Dolby Vision. Then there are the movie theaters, once they reopen of course, which is going to even further increase cash flow.

Do you know a company that uses Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos a decent amount? Netflix. 

 
They of course have other products: long list >! The company develops and licenses its audio technologies, such as AAC & HE-AAC, a digital audio codec solution used for a range of media applications.; AVC, a digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency used in media devices; Dolby AC-4, an audio coding technology that delivers new audio experiences to a range of playback devices; and Dolby Atmos technology for cinema and a range of media devices. Its audio technologies also include Dolby Digital, a digital audio coding technology that provides multichannel sound to applications; Dolby Digital Plus, a digital audio coding technology that offers audio transmission for a range of media applications and devices; Dolby TrueHD, a digital audio coding technology providing encoding for media application; Dolby Vision, an imaging technology for cinema and media devices; Dolby Voice, an audio conferencing technology; and HEVC, a digital video codec with high bandwidth efficiency to support for media devices. In addition, the company designs and manufactures digital cinema servers, cinema processors, amplifiers, loudspeakers, hardware components, video conferencing solutions, and other products for the cinema, television, broadcast, communication, and entertainment industries. Further, it offers various services to support theatrical and television production for cinema exhibition, broadcast, and home entertainment. The company serves film studios, content creators, post-production facilities, cinema operators, broadcasters, and video game designers. It sells its products directly to the end users, as well as through dealers and distributors worldwide.!<

Dolby is arguably one of the most expertly managed technology companies from a financial standpoint.  Their capital deployment philosophy includes investing in new growth technologies and rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Their balance sheet never carries any long-term debt and currently includes $1.1 billion in cash...

Seems like a steal for $93...

DD - Why I think we're at the ground floor for $KLIC,149,lhfv63,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhfv63/dd_why_i_think_were_at_the_ground_floor_for_klic/,69,1613058779.0,"Due to the global microchip shortage, automation companies involved in the production of microchips are doing well, $KLIC (Kulicke and Soffa Industries, Inc) is one of them. In my opinion it's üöÄüöÄüöÄ (obligatory rockets for bullish sentiment)  for this stock.

They build automation and tools for the production of microchips. When investigating this company, I found this video to be very useful [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkdOZalpCbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkdOZalpCbg) they seem to prioritize customer retention and have developed a configurable system from listening to customer feedback.

There's a few reasons why I think this company is going to do very well in 2021:

* They are addressing a known bottleneck. PS5s and X-Box aren't being built fast enough due to supply chain issues: [https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-shortage-20201217-enxdgcnydvhbhm4p3uxdk6xetu-story.html](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-biz-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-shortage-20201217-enxdgcnydvhbhm4p3uxdk6xetu-story.html)
   * I'm a big believer in removing bottlenecks. I assume that all companies involved in the supply chain for consoles, computers, etc. are investing in expediting their processes (similar companies to $KLIC are also doing well and business has picked up in 2020 and 2021, you can search for competitors if you want, there are similar trends).
* Solid balance sheet and positive trends:
   * Book value of approximately $13.01 per share. This is about 807 MM. For additional context, their current market cap is at 2.7 billion [https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/book-value](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/book-value)
   * Zero debt [https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/total-long-term-debt-quarterly](https://www.zacks.com/stock/chart/KLIC/fundamental/total-long-term-debt-quarterly)
   * Solid recent growth. Most of their 1yr growth has occurred in the last 2-3 months. I suspect this is institutional diversification, but who knows.
   * This ticker is beginning to make some noise: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/klic](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/klic)
   * I think this company is less vulnerable to rug-pulls, I think there's enough value, momentum and global business need for what they are doing.

There are a few risks:

* Relatively unknown company. I found it when investigating other companies. I didn't pay much attention at first. I think there's many others like me.
* COVID demand will not last forever, at least not at the current levels; however, I think there's still months, perhaps years of built up demand. I don't expect we'll go back to normal any time soon or ever. More people will continue to work from home when comparing to years like 2018.
* This is not a sexy company. I don't really mind that, but let's be honest, that's not helping in attracting any eyeballs. This is the biggest risk IMHO in the current market.
* I'm sure there's other risks that I have not identified.

**This is not investment advice, you are responsible for your own decisions**. If you choose to invest in any stock, I'd recommend you to remember that no stock is worth all your money, invest for the long run and when you think you've made adequate profits and are ready for the next opportunity, move on. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast.

Positions:

YOLOed 40 60c(07/16 expiry) @ $1.10, thinking of selling other positions to buy shares and go longer (again, no stock is worth all my money, I will not put all of my money in this ticker). This is a personal preference, to each their own.

&#x200B;

Edit:

This post has received a bit more attention than I expected. Thanks for looking at my DD. I'll address a few things here cause I got stuff to do, would like to respond in a more personal manner, and will try to do so later.

* First and foremost, thanks for the Gold /u/Far-Escape-7553 there was no need, but the gesture   
 is much appreciated.
* Thanks for those who have offered challenging positions. I'm in the process of developing my active trading strategy and I'm trying to achieve a mixture between value+momentum for active trades. If you offered a challenge I will look into that to see if I can improve my process.
* For those who challenge my account history. Not a bot or HF drone. Long time lurker that wanted to add a bit of variety to the sub.
* Also, I think I should have said this initially:
   * I don't think this is the next meme stock, I hope it isn't because I don't want to worry too much about exiting at the right time.
   * If I'm ""too right"" and this booms, I do not plan to post position updates because I don't want the burden of having people hold as long as I hold.
   * If I'm wrong and this tanks, I hope that not many of you shares in the losses. Only you can determine your exit strategy, please remember to have one!",2021-02-11 15:52:59

How a short/gamma squeeze on Tilray is causing the ENTIRE cannabis market to moon and how to avoid becoming a bag holder when this all comes crashing down,13312,lhf2qw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhf2qw/how_a_shortgamma_squeeze_on_tilray_is_causing_the/,3120,1613055275.0,"***Obligatory: SIR, THIS IS A CASINO. This isn't financial advice in any way shape or form.***

TLDR: This run is going to end with the cannabis stocks back down 50-80% or more from the levels they are at. **$CRLBF** is the real play here for the smart players that want USA exposure to the legislation. *We just like the stocks now, not later.*

Ok, listen up normies.

Yeah I'm talking to the newbies specifically because the OGs here already know everything I'm about to share, but your insufferable groupthink and movement mentality shit pissed me off enough to make a post. **Don't post DD if you have no clue. Ask someone for help and take your ridicule until someone comes along to help you.**

I used to post weekly DD on Sunday here a couple of years ago before one of you literally contacted my wife IRL. Not even kidding. So I made a new account. This is my first contribution back and I'm going to try and ensure some of you don't blow your chance at massive gains here by explaining ***what is actually going on.***

**CNBC and anybody telling you that this is just 'momentum' and 'sentiment' is lying to you. The hedge funds are playing these right along with us. Don't ask me for proof, this isn't Twitter. Reasons why they are playing with us:**

1. When there is money to be made, hedge funds and HFT funds are there before you
2. The floats are so small on these they can take sizable positions on both sides and stand to have massive gains, all the while handing you guys the bags.

That's all you need to know.

So in response to all you posting ""real DD"" with why these companies are the best and you're going to hold to the moon and never sell:

**I'm over it -- I can tell instantly how uninformed you are** when I read some poorly thought out DD about why CGC or TLRY or APHA is a long term play because they're talking about USA legislation. These are Canadian companies. Get your head back on straight. You're here for the trade and the bet, not for the fundamentals, and if that's it, then fine, ignore the rest of this post and pick an exit, and if not, read on so you don't hold more bags.

This place has never been one to care for fundamentals, but let me talk some sense into you so you can post some gain porn and I can tell you to fuck off instead of you guys all yelling ""MaNiPuLaTiOn ShOrT LaDdErS""

Let's take a look at some of today's gainers:

(changed tickers for automod avoidance)

**$USMJay** \- Penny stock, worth absolute nothing for a reason

**$SNDL** \- Up ridiculous amount, have a billion shares outstanding, just diluted them all the other day

**$TeeRTeeC** \- Terra Tech, they grow weed, from all indications, do it poorly

**$OhGeeEye** \- lol

**$HUGE** \- Probably the only one in the lot worth a YOLO on the chance they get an acquisition like GW Pharma did but they don't have the same product portfolio or prospects GW has.

&#x200B;

Now, if you're simply playing this to get in and get out, **great for you**. The people saying (and believing) ""$SNDL $10 EOW! HOLD THE LINE"" and stuff like this are just absolutely brand new normies and are clueless, do not listen to them. If you yolo'd on cheap calls in Dec/Jan, congrats, take your gains and don't be like the $GME bagholders.

If you're investing in any of the names I just posted above, expect any money you put in to at some point in the next 12 months be worth approximately 20% of what it is worth now. Literally. They're far worse than the main bunch (CGC, CRON, ACB, TLRY, APHA) but the main bunch is nothing to write home about either.

&#x200B;

# THIS IS WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING:

**Tilray had 40% short interest**. It's not $GME level, but it's pretty high. When the stock crested $40 it really started taking off, why though? Notice this week's FD option chain:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kyqeiwljeug61.png?width=917&format=png&auto=webp&s=0c1b48e12518515f09582289bd7f8a4f47a09629

Tilray has a 95M share float, those 42 calls represent roughly 1.5M shares held as a hedge just by themselves. Previous to this run up, that represents roughly 5% of the average daily volume of the stock, BY ITSELF. Those are shares that until Monday can be considered removed from the float because they're held as a hedge. They may get loaned out to be shorted, but that will only speed up the squeeze here.

***The important part: Today (2/10/21) the stock fell hard after open down to around 44 and found massive support all the way back to up 66. The most sold front week call? $40/$42 strikes. Premium when I screen shotted this? $22.20. Stocks going to pin above $60 for awhile likely, unless people are stupid enough to buy the OTM calls, in which case, it may squeeze itself higher.***

Smart hedge funds are going to pile into this, sell you the calls, shove the price up to keep selling you calls, then watch them all evaporate worthless in one of the future weeks in the chain, dump back the shares to help shove the price down, oh and did I mention? They shorted the top.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ivy78woneug61.png?width=392&format=png&auto=webp&s=0604940c09126dc6d5b96a9cc5f17e4013ae5d9d

It's just another plain old stock acting as a derivative of the option chain gamma squeeze. That's it, with a bit of short squeeze thrown in there and a WHOLE BUNCH of WSB fomo. The shorts are covering and pushing up the volume, likely re-shorting on the way up, and then you have WSB fomo'ing in to round out the total: a massive volume of 200 million shares today. You've got people that think this thing will skyrocket to 500+ (and it may) but the stakes get higher and higher each ladder up you take and the moves become more violent and more likely it comes all the way back down in short time the quicker it goes up.

Might it get there? Sure. But be prepare to take profits when it does because...

# ITS CALLED MEAN REVERSION. THIS CANT GO ON FOREVER.

Not to mention, the moves you are seeing are in completely overvalued companies, with horrible fundamentals, and poor prospects.

Oh what's that? CGC got some CBD treats for Martha, seems fitting that something ill is going on in this industry considering she went to prison for insider trading. If the dog treats get you excited about the stock, **Martha belongs here more than you do.**

200M shares today means people who were long term bag holders cashed out and the shares have turned over the float two times in two days. That also means the shorts have turned over and are now short again. It means the HFT firms are feasting on all of you. It means Citadel is making a pile on the spreads.

**What to take away: An amount of shares equal to the entire float has changed hands, or in other words, fewer reason for people to bag hold. Fewer people that have to hedge. Fewer people that have to cover. Fewer people to help stabilize any of these upper price tiers, and keep the price stable by holding, and more reason it's going to collapse sooner (or later).**

But, this IS a casino after all...

# Let's see what happened with TLRY last time this happened (oh, you're new here? Yeah, this isn't the first time):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/p652mvgreug61.png?width=587&format=png&auto=webp&s=d95f2b0ccf946717859bffb28601dfd29e999e0b

Looks eerily familiar to something else recently. Last time this occurred it traded between $100 and $300 in a single week timeframe.

For those of you that are new: **THIS IS NOT NORMAL. STOCKS DO NOT ALWAYS DO THIS. You are in the infancy of a new age of trading, but people still know, fundamentals matter a whole lot more than everyone is leading on, and these valuations are getting extremely overextended.**

Eventually, in the first squeeze Tilray bled off until the pandemic hit and it piled down to $2.43 a share. At $2.43/share, I would have bought it. Even at $10/12/14. At these levels? You're just ultimately out of touch but I look forward to the loss porn.

***So in short, again: Sir, this is a casino.***

&#x200B;

Timeline of events, and how to not become a bagholder:

1. $APHA earnings are good, stocks pop a bit, and level off
2. Legislators pull a pump and dump since they probably have calls and say planning on some laws regarding changing the schedule of cannabis (notice: we will likely NOT get outright legalization, just re-scheduling)
3. $CGC earnings are actually awful, with the caveat they have profitability on the horizon
4. $TLRY gets a UK deal
5. $TLRY starts going insane - since $APHA is a reverse merger with a .81 value share to share, it starts pumping, people start buying the lower priced cannabis stuff and entire sector starts moving on ""overall strength""
6. There's no strength, there's a gamma squeeze backed by investor momentum, and a short squeeze on Tilray.
7. This is going to come back down violently then plateau out like GME and pull a slow bleed the rest of the way back down, just like the second graph I posted. There is no fundamental or even **POSSIBILITY** of better fundamentals immediately on US legislation. The cost to enter the US market will most definitely cause capex and goodwill capital outflows, and set back their profitability since there are established MSO's in the USA already. The USA opening the market to these companies will only further degrade the actual balance sheets/income statements and slow down profits and you know what institutions and shareholders like? **Yep. Profits.**
8. **Finally, how to not become a bag holder:** The market can stay irrational way, way, way longer than you expect. So this may go on for a bit, but refer back to 7. It's coming back down eventually, set expectations and pick your exit, or start to shave off your position as it goes up and let a portion of it run. Eventually, you have to sell to actually realize a gain, don't forget that. Once you do, close the chart, remove it from your watchlist, check back in on it in a month if you want to get back in when you have a clear head.

The Canadian operators are literally the last companies I'd play off a US legislation play, and one of the only ones worth owning in $APHA for the arbitrage play on the shares. But if Tilray comes crashing back down, $APHA will as well along with all of them, and you have to hope you lose a lot less on $APHA crashing than you'll make on the arbitrage between the share price.

THIS IS ALL JUST ""SENTIMENT"" BASED YOLOING BY THIS SUB. It has probably driven uneducated retail into the trades also - who will also become bag holders.

&#x200B;

***Let me put this in big letters for those of you that can only read big font and use crayons:***

# NONE OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE REAL USA MARKET EXPOSURE, THEY ARE CANADIAN COMPANIES. THEY DO NOT HAVE MARKET POSITIONING AND ARE NOT POISED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF US LEGALIZATION.

*IF ANYTHING: IT WILL HURT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND SET BACK EARNINGS BECAUSE OF CAPEX AND CASH OUTFLOWS TO GET A POSITION IN THE MARKET AND SOME OF THEM WILL GO OUT OF BUSINESS BECAUSE OF IT, WHILE OTHERS WILL FALL OUT OF PROFITIABILITY TO ENTER THE MARKET AND COMPETE WITH THE REAL PLAYERS*.

&#x200B;

*^(Who are the real players? (Cresco $CRLBF and Curaleaf $CURLF)* *^(- do your own DD or wait for a post next week)**\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*)*

&#x200B;

**Conclusion: Nobody should plan on holding these long term. Don't let someone else hand you bags like I did this morning at open on the pop unless you plan to hand your bags off and find the next play.**

WKHS DD: Zero chance of winning a significant portion of USPS contract,202,lheq8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lheq8x/wkhs_dd_zero_chance_of_winning_a_significant/,97,1613053794.0,"I fully expect to get pushback for this, but here goes.

**THESIS**

Workhorse (WKHS) is a self-promotion scheme more than anything else. It has a history of making grandiose claims of massive contracts with big respectable corporations, yet *somehow* they never see revenue or sales from them. And finally, the USPS has zero interest in dealing with WKHS, because they already kicked them out of the contract bid before.

In short, there is a near-zero chance that WKHS will see any significant portion of the USPS contract.

Part 1: History of Self Promotion

Part 2: The USPS Contract

Part 3: WKHS Manufacturability

Part 4: Positions or Ban

\---------------

**PART 1: HISTORY OF SELF PROMOTION**

WKHS has a history of claiming big contract wins. Yet time and time again, these contracts never materialize to any significant sales. Lets review:

* [In 2017, the CEO claims they had $300 million in pre-orders](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1113616_workhorse-ceo-300-million-in-preorders-for-plug-in-hybrid-pickup-trucks?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link)
   * Near-zero revenues for the subsequent 4 years, need I say more?
* [UPS orders 950 vehicles](https://www.trucks.com/2018/06/14/ups-order-950-workhorse-electric-delivery-trucks/)
   * In reality, WKHS delivered 50 vehicles in 2018. [Workhorse still boasts about UPS as a ""blue chip customer.""](https://workhorse.com/company.html?source=content_type%3Areact%7Cfirst_level_url%3Aarticle%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link) But the standing 900 vehicles are *on-demand*, so UPS could do a test run with the first initial order. How'd it go? [Workhorse has been removed from UPS's sustainability reports.](https://sustainability.ups.com/media/2019-progress-report.pdf)
* Fedex ordered 20 trucks in 2016
   * Only 2 were ever delivered. [They tried to make a whole press-run about the one delivered in 2018.](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/05/01/1493806/0/en/Plug-Power-and-Workhorse-Provide-FedEx-Express-With-First-ProGen-Fuel-Cell-Powered-Electric-Delivery-Van.html)
* Several other examples of press releases for small amounts of trucks ordered. Many only have a small fraction of the ordered amount delivered.
* Most importantly, as far as I can tell, there's NEVER BEEN A SINGLE RE-ORDER.
* [Now the company boasts of an order for 6320 vehicles](https://ir.workhorse.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/162/workhorse-receives-purchase-order-from-pride-group)
   * Let's take a look at that fine print: ""The order is split between Workhorse‚Äôs C-1000 and C-650 models and is subject to various production and delivery conditions."" Yeah, we'll see how that goes.

\---------------

**PART 2: THE USPS CONTRACT**

There is a near-zero chance WHKS will see any significant win from the USPS contract. This is best conveyed by the below timeline and the statements from the competing bidders Oshkosh-Ford.

First, lets go over the situation. The USPS has been looking to find a partner/s to replace its long-life vehicles. This is a massive fleet, and the contract's estimated value is around $6.3 billion over a few years. The Workhorse timeline in this multi-year bidding process is below, but the takeaway is that there are three bidders left:

* Workhorse
* Ford-Oshkosh
* Karsan-Morgan Olsen

*I'll get in to the bull arguments and the zero-emissions vs hybrid vs diesel issues further below.*

Here is a timeline of our Workhorse bid (CREDIT TO FUZZY PANDA RESEARCH):

1. In April 2015, Workhorse advances from 40 interested suppliers to the top 15.
2. [In September 2016, **Workhorse fails to advance to the top 6.**](https://www.postal-reporter.com/blog/usps-awards-37-million-in-contracts-for-next-generation-delivery-vehicle-prototypes/)
3. Later that month, Workhorse joins a team that did advance, VT Hackney.
4. From 2017-2019 USPS tests 50 prototype vehicles
   1. In Spring 2018, a USPS employee was hospitalized when a VT Hackney-Workhorse vehicle's brakes failed and the vehicle ran uncontrollably downhill. Testing was paused for their vehicles.
   2. Other failures during testing reportedly include: Vehicle running out of range (stranded), suspension broke when hitting railroad tracks, door failures, safety belt failures, and motors failing.
5. In November 2019, VT Hackney sold its stake in a potential $6.3 billion contract to Workhorse [for a mere $1m + $6.6m WKHS stock](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1425287/000162828019013414/wkhs-20191031.htm).

So, given the above, how are WKHS bulls so optimistic on their chances of winning? Well, it has to do with Biden's statements that he wants to [replace the entire US fleet with EV](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/biden-starts-the-electric-vehicle-race-with-big-plans-to-replace-the-federal-fleet-11611697897). He's also made comments on targeting a large percentage of zero-emissions vehicles. Remember, Karsan-Morgan Olson's proposal was a hybrid. And Oshkosh-Ford's proposal was Diesel. Only Workhorse had a true zero-emission proposal.

I use past tense because these are dynamic situations. And recent comments by Oshkosh management indicate that they plan to leverage Ford's recently announced E-transit (100% electric) as a potential option. See the following statements:

>‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got a very strong, very comprehensive bid that meets all of the needs of the U.S. postal service. So I mean, I‚Äôll repeat that, we do meet all the needs of the U.S. Postal Service. Meaning, if they want, under the Biden administration, more weight toward one type of propulsion than another, we‚Äôre ready for that. Now we‚Äôve got our fingers crossed. We believe we‚Äôve got high reliability solutions and hope to have good news at the next earnings call,‚Äù John Pfeifer, president and chief operating officer of Oshkosh, said in a call with investors last week.  
>  
>Pfiefer said he expects the Postal Service to make a decision in March. [\[Source\]](https://www.trucks.com/2021/02/01/electric-mail-trucks-make-sense/)

And in the very recent earnings call (you can google transcripts, this website cannot be linked):

>**Michael Shlisky (Analyst)**  
>  
>I also want to ask a quick follow up on another question about the USPS contract. Your opinion is based on the Ford Transit, I believe, and we've gotten since this last quarter, we just announced we just heard the announcement of the new Ford e-transit coming out here in 2021 so you comment that you can address whatever the USPS‚Äôs needs are as far as our power train. Is it as simple as just substituting the transit for the e-transit or do you have to have a special reopening on the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?  
>  
>**John Pfeifer (COO, Oshkosh)**  
>  
>So there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs that as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit ban, because of confidentiality, but I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.  
>  
>**Wilson Jones (CEO, Oshkosh)**  
>  
>I think the foundational statement there is we furnished a program vehicles that meet their current and future needs. I think that's the best way to leave it, Mike.

So USPS has the following options:

1. Work with the no-name vendor with a history of catastrophic vehicle failures in its small testing batch.
2. Work with Oshkosh-Ford to update their proposal to include some reduced-emissions diesel vehicles for 2021/2022 delivery. These can be used in the future for rural environments with limited charging infrastructure. The 2022-2025 deliveries could be electric vehicles based on the best selling cargo van, the Ford Transit (E-transit).

Note the specific situation in #2 is pure speculation on my part. But either way, it is not a hard choice. Ford-Oshkosh has this in the bag. \[I haven't gone in to why Karsan-Morgan Olson isn't a strong candidate, since it seems like that is universally understood. I do believe they are likely a solid backup for a small % of the USPS contract, though.\]

\---------------

**PART 3: WKHS MANUFACTURABILITY**

I'll keep this short because it is already getting long. Workhorse has never produced its vehicles at this scale, ever. This is a massive risk. There's zero reason for USPS or others to take that risk on. I know, WKHS bulls say ""Lordstown"" like it means something.

This means nothing. Having a facility is not enough. Cars have tens of thousands of complex moving parts and require precise assembly and process controls.  If you don't work as an engineer, you cannot imagine the effort that comes in to developing, maintaining, and scaling a manufacturing process this complex. Until Lordstown can demonstrate that it can crank these vehicles out, it is simply a manufacturing space.

\---------------

**PART 4: YOLO**

Ford calls, Oshkosh calls, Workhorse puts. For those less risky, be sure to buy April calls and puts, since the USPS contract could be announced in late March. I have enough fodder to double down on FDs if my current March 19th OSK and WKHS positions expire before a decision.

More $KT DD,104,lhe9k9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhe9k9/more_kt_dd/,47,1613051865.0,"Earlier today u/clubba posted some good DD on $KT - Korea Telecom - looking at the low price/book ratio. It's a good metric to get a lead on potential value plays (LOL at WSB turning into a value stock forum, way to go DFV), but there's more to look at.

Book value tells you if the company has underlying value or if it's just a house of cards. Price to book ratio tells you *what the market thinks of that underlying value.* In this case, almost nil. A good question to ask when you see a metric that seems way too positive to pass up is, why are other people passing it up?

First, more about the company: they do mobile networks, sat TV, finance (credit cards), and infosec services. They also do some robotics cause it's fun?

Telecom was one of the worst performing sectors over the past year, by the way. This can be a positive if you're a value investor-it means the price may be depressed by the broader industry.

To the stock itself, the value play isn't as strong as the price to book makes it out to be. Again, if that tells you it has underlying value, great. But is it making any money? Price to earnings is 8 or 9 (depending if you're looking at the past year or projected), compared to 12ish for the industry, another good sign. Earnings growth projections are positive also, but not phenomenal. ~~Negatively, they did not pay a dividend last year, which is like value investor 101: show me the dividend!~~ **Correction: evidently they typically announce dividends in the spring, and backdate the ex date to the prior year, which is why no sites are showing a 2020 divided yet.** But they did announce a share buy back and a 2021 dividend. They have a comparatively small market, and have branched out internationally as a result. That can be expensive.

Tl;dr - I think there are positive signs for a long term value play, but what this company is lacking is meaningful growth. The point of investing is to make money, not just hold value.

I'm going to watch it, because if they do a spin off or some other move to position for innovation or greater market share then it could be poised to take off.",2021-02-11 13:57:45

Either it's all a bunch of retards or some organized folks making the posts (or both)...

It's like you could just start a pump based off news like earnings or a weed merger or whatever, and then try to keep the pump going higher using retail investors who will never exit when they should. Easy extra gains if you can manipulate the market already with large volume alone and then get a bunch of retards to buy due to FOMO.

I'm really skeptical of all of these stocks that have already gone parabolic and you get these people saying it will still ""go to the moon"" with no counter arguments. Yea maybe they will but maybe they won't but nobody knows for sure.

If the US political cycle had shown us anything, it's that it is easy to manipulate people on the internet. Feelings will often win over facts too (apes strong yada yada)... it's like playing the lottery but with bigger consequences.

Retail investors do have power again, but that power could be so easily pulled one way or another by these meme stocks.

All I'm saying is do your own research before yoloing your retirement away or getting into debt....

* Nobody here is going to handhold a noob! If you haven‚Äôt ever traded in the stock-market , don't come to these forums to ***learn*** *to invest or trade.* 
* The forums may be a good place to gauge the sentiment on stocks, but ***not*** to gather *real* investment insights
* Gain and Loss porn posts by fellow retards may be entertaining but sometimes it is just that - entertainment. There may not be much to learn from their *experience*
* Recent swing in Gamestop (GME) stock has shown that a herd of retail investors alone can't sustain the momentum in stock price, especially if the underlying fundamentals aren't supporting it.
* You alone are responsible for gains and losses in *your* portfolio. Remember, you and I also have bills to pay.

"Wed AM Gamma Analysis & Trading Day Retrospective on GME, TLRY, APHA, SNDL, CRSR, AMC",594,lhdeep,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhdeep/wed_am_gamma_analysis_trading_day_retrospective/,211,1613048504.0,"Below is a dump of a bunch of popular tickers. Some don't have spotgamma data, but all have tradingvolatility data. This data is a bit stale - it's Wednesday AM data, so whatever happened today changed it in terms of option open interest.

[https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz](https://imgur.com/a/bEpZEBz)

**How to interpret:**

Whenever there is call or put open interest, it COULD BE options dealers are net sellers. Whatever the net 'short gamma' (total net options sold) by dealers will in turn result in gamma hedging as the price of the stock moves past. This generally means that dealers buy if the price going up, and sell if price going down, regardless of if they have short puts or short calls on the books. This effect can be as much as 80% of the total options outstanding in my experience, but is usually less. This caused a lot of the GameStop action we saw before known as a gamma squeeze.  It is possible to create the reverse, and that's a hobby of Steve ""Stevie"" Cohen (to sell a giant straddle and lock the price down). If a stock seems to be de-volatilized after I said it had a lot of gamma, there's some chance this happened.

Delta de-hedging is also a thing. When options expire, speculators (read: you) tend to sell the itm options for profit, and tend not to roll them fully, which causes reversion against the options. In other words, if there are a lot of ITM puts expiring, the stock will tend to go up, while if there are a lot of ITM calls expiring, the stock will tend to go down. This tends to matter the most on the monthly and quarterly and yearly option expirations. This Friday appears to not be one of those.

Because this data is stale, you can't draw firm conclusions, and you'd want the update tomorrow if you have access to these tools (spotgamma and tradingvolatility, or you can add by hand). However, it's important to understand the magnitude of these gamma hedging effects by dealers. These are always relative to the floating shares of the stock. For reference:

AMC: 114m shares (Maybe, they just had a bunch of new issuances and debt conversion, could be higher)

CRSR: 88.1m shares

SNDL:435m shares

APHA:312m shares

TLRY: 137m shares

GME: 70m shares

In my experience, if a price move will involve 20% or more of the shares in open interest (options contracts x 100), it will tend to cause gamma squeeze effects in a lot of speculation. Numbers under this will still impact. It starts being not very noticeable at 5% or less for a price range (such as a 20% spread). Typically the price ranges you would look to would be plausible price ranges.

Today, a lot of weed stocks ran all the way up their gamma ramps and stalled, which means new gamma ramps need to be constructed, and I would expect it to be harder to move these weed stocks up more tomorrow except for SNDL (more on that below) For this reason, you will need to look CLOSELY at the new options printed for end of week and on as of tomorrow AM (or Thursday) when option data comes out. Right now, these stocks will look like all downside - gamma ramp below current position, since those stocks ripped through their gamma ramps completely today.

**Edit: Thursday 2:20pm EST analysis:**

All stocks at the end of the day require NET BUYERS to go up.  My interpretation with the broad collapse of 420 stocks is just that people took profits/not enough new buyers. The gamma ramps that can shoot stocks up ALSO can shoot them down if you run out of buyers and go to net selling. That appears to be what is happening. That also means if there are inflows they can shoot back up though.

**Brief analysis:**

**GME**: I honestly have no idea. The stock is for sure gamma dominated right now, and getting past this expiry will reduce volatility a lot as things roll off the book. Interesting, there are a LOT of puts and most of the purchases of options appear to be puts right now.

**TLRY**: This just ripped through a gamma ramp, forcing buy of a remaining 5 or so million shares on the float of 137, which is a small effect. Most of the buying today was thus new capital coming in, which is quite remarkable. Looking at the OI tomorrow for expiry friday will be very important in understanding what is going on, but, **THIS STOCK WAS FUELED BY PURE NEW BUYING AND NEW CALL OPTION PURCHASE.** I guess there's no substitute for being ""The"" weed stock. Just remember that every dollar up requires the same amount of new capital as the last dollar - 50% days get a lot harder when already up 50% the day before. New gamma ramps will be created, but these get harder as IV has already risen a lot. Thus, would expect the momentum to continue, but this will quickly go into a bubble state like GME did, and we can in turn expect a spectacular pop when people get distracted and move on to the new shiney. Be cautious! I'll do more TLRY bubble analysis below.

**APHA**: This also just fully ripped through gamma ramp, and in fact did on Tuesday. At this point, it's all dependent on new open interest creation and money. Gamma ramp wasn't actually that big though, and the forced selling friday is small. This appears to mostly just be straight buying.

**SNDL**: I don't have data on spotgamma, so I had to rely on just tradingvolatility.com. My read is that this stock has an outrageous amount of gamma, on the order of the float of the stock, and you can expect more vol. This leads me to suspect that the float data isn‚Äôt accurate (outstanding shares are 1.5b while float is stated to be 436m). There are some moderate ITM call expirations Friday, on the order of 15-20m shares on a float of 435m shares, so I don‚Äôt expect a huge impact.  But, this stock appears to be pretty spring-loaded with options and could go nuts again.  Examining data tomorrow will be important.

**CRSR**: This isn‚Äôt actually that gamma dominated at a float of 88m. It‚Äôs right in the middle of a decent sized gamma ramp, so buying will send it up somewhat faster ‚Äì and selling will send it down somewhat faster. Friday expirations are not that significant. This stock will behave semi-normally as a result.

**AMC**: I‚Äôm not sure what the float is here, but the actual option OI suggests AMC is in the middle of a gamma ramp, and that gamma ramp is immensely strong relative to float ‚Äì this stock is expected to continue a lot of volatility unless these options are a bunch of covered calls or covered puts. My suspicion from price action is that they are not, and this will keep being very volatile. This ramp will lose strength in the 8s, so it will require a much heavier lift to get past there. Friday expirations are immaterial. Selling also can send it down, much like CRSR.

&#x200B;

**TLRY Bubble Analysis**

Tilray long ago on about 75m shares got to $180 in a bubble, and that popped a little without insider lockup... when lockup happened it killed a new surge in jan 2019, sending it down a bit to $70.  We are now at 130m shares outstanding.  That means the shares outstanding went up 73%, and float probably is up a bit more post-lockup, so let's call it 80%. 70 bucks divided by 1.8 is $40, which represents similar mini-bubble prices, which we are over. Therefore, while I think this can and probably will go higher, I don't think we are going to hit the $180 easily. We might see $100 or $120. But I think this is starting to get into heavy lift territory.  Another view would be to see that GME was about $10b-$15b of retail money in, and TLRY market cap is $8b already.  If I think GME was max retail money in, maybe TLRY can get half of that. That puts a barrier on it getting past the low to mid 100s in my opinion. My advice is - this looks like it's beginning to be a bubble - best practice in a bubble is to not get greedy, and take profits as you go. Bubbles pop when new money in slows. I personally don't trade them because they are my worst trading skill. Good luck!

**Vulture Strategy**

Whenever everyone is FOMOing hard over these stocks, they tend to dump prior favorites to buy - stuff like NFLX, TSLA, whatever the last memes were, random banned stocks here that we also watch. Some of those favorites are quality stocks, and others are the next meme next week that aren't yet in the limelight. If you have long-standing S&P500 or Nasdaq-100 stocks that are down for no real reason big tomorrow (and today), or a meme favorite, you may just want to snag some shares cheap if you aren't feeling these stocks. May see some more flash sales.

*My positions: I own none of these!  But I'm long the market, and you guys dumping your winners to buy TLRY and similar is I think why NDX took a dump this morning, and that kind of hurt. Fortunately I did hold, and did buy the dip, and did buy TSLA calls. Which I'll regret because you'll probably sell more TSLA to buy more TLRY tomorrow. I intend to enter into positions on none of these, because I'm a square.*

Because we got invaded by r/investing I'm supposed to say this isn't financial advice or investment advice, and it sure as hell isn't either of those! Go make your own decisions and learn to trade, ffs. Let's be real, these are speculative trading stocks at these prices (other than maybe CRSR), not really investments.",2021-02-11 13:01:44

APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage creating biggest short squeeze,0,lhdclf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhdclf/apha_vs_tlry_arbitrage_creating_biggest_short/,52,1613048343.0," 

A lot of people are making the APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage play in the past few days, that is, buying APHA and shorting the same amount of TLRY, thinking it is free money based on the ""future"" share exchange ratio after the merger. What they didn't realize is that they are helping to increase short interest in TLRY and adding oil to one of the biggest short squeezes in stock history, that is unfolding in front of us right now.

Let me explain, in the long term they would be right ""eventually"", either APHA is too cheap or TLRY is too expensive. However at the moment stock market doesn't have to make sense and can head in the opposite direction for a prolong period of time, and as TLRY gets higher it will trigger broker's automatic short-covering at \*any\* price when some shorters' net balance get close to zero. This will push TLRY even higher and shake out more accounts, triggering a snowball effect. Unfortunately, there is no way to convince your broker that your APHA ""long"" shares are as good as TLRY shares and that you are self-sufficient. In fact, these APHA shares also take away some of your cash balance and contribute to the automatic short-covering.

I haven't seen this kind of short squeeze before and would welcome any thoughts.",2021-02-11 12:59:03

$TLRY,137,lhd3ww,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhd3ww/tlry/,226,1613047442.0,"$TLRY and $APHA are scheduled to merge in Q2 in an all stock deal. $APHA investors will receive. 8381 shares of $TLRY. 

In these mergers hedge funds usually make their money by doing something they deem risk free called arbitrage. By shorting the expensive stock and being long on the less expensive stock it doesn't matter if the stocks go up or down the only thing that matters is that on the merger date they would be worth whatever the price paid for them is. 

So in $TLRY and $APHA case in an arbitrage position the profit is the difference between where they are now and where it would be if $APHA is 83% of $TLRY stock price.

So here is where we could blow up the hedge funds.

SHORT SQUEEZE $TLRY. 

Instead of TLRY becoming closer to that 17% premium the difference in price has widened and there is a lot of institutional shorting going on. Short interest is currently 37% of the free float. One out of every three shares floated is being shorted.  

On a low volume stock. 

TLRY could also with that higher share price renegotiate the deal and get more APHA shares or look for a different target to merge with. 

As TLRY shareholders we could call for a vote (forcing all the shorts to close) to form a comitee to entertain buyout offers.g",2021-02-11 12:44:02

&#x200B;

Listen up y‚Äôall. I know we hate contrarians here, but hopefully, some of you monkeys can put on your thinking hats for a second and gather ‚Äòround. Remember, true diamond hands don‚Äôt care if the stock goes up or down, they observe the facts and make sound decisions based on them to amplify their own profits. Now let‚Äôs learn some basic corporate finance together.

We need to talk about TLRY.

As you all know, TLRY spiked today‚Ä¶and the day before‚Ä¶etc‚Ä¶up to almost $70 per share. Some of you made money on calls, and I‚Äôm proud of you, but this pump is going to end and I‚Äôm here to explain why.

Obviously, everyone is going to point to the obvious to counter my short term bear view - the merger with Aphria. I‚Äôm not going to waste your time telling you why this merger might not even happen; no - instead I‚Äôm going to humor you and assume it does in my simple analysis. I‚Äôm going to use only numbers directly from TLRY‚Äôs merger announcement presentation, which you scrubs can find [here](https://ir.tilray.com/static-files/42b99b9b-5574-499d-b266-aabd0393103e).

Let‚Äôs start with two basic facts:

TLRY Current Share Count: 158.3 million

APHA Current Share Count: 316.7 million

Now, the merger proposal says essentially this: the two companies will become one company ‚Äì nothing will happen to TLRYs stock (it will roll over into the new company), but Aphria‚Äôs stock will be converted into TLRY shares at a ratio of 0.84:1. This ratio is our first new term of the day: the conversion ratio.

We can multiply the Aphria share number by this ratio to get the number of shares it converts into pursuant to the merger. The resultant number is about 282 million shares. Now we add this to the number of TLRY shares that roll over, and we have a total outstanding shares post-merger of \~440 million. This number is called the Pro-forma shares outstanding.

Now, we take the Pro-forma shares outstanding and multiply that by the share price (everyone is saying this whole pump is share-price merger arbitrage anyways) to get the Pro-forma market cap: a whopping $30 billion US dollars!

Carrying on with the valuation‚Ä¶we add the merged company‚Äôs debt to the market cap to get enterprise value (I'm not worrying about cash for you hardos out there, just trying to illustrate a point here) ‚Äì and we get an enterprise value of 31ish billion dollars. This is essentially the value of the Company as indicated by the market.

Now we can start looking at multiples. You may be asking yourself, young monkey, ‚ÄúWhy do multiples matter?‚Äù. Well, they essentially give us a way to value stocks relative to one another. This type of valuation, simply enough, is known as relative valuation and is used every day by the top investment banks and hedge funds in the world. One useful multiple in sales-driven businesses like this (especially those with no positive cash flows) is the enterprise value to revenues multiple. Generally, companies trade in a range that the market considers fair. Google is trading about 7x for example. Tesla is at 20 something. Other weed companies are in the 20s geenrally. We can calculate this ratio for the merged company in question using the combined revenue figure provided in the merger documents and it comes out to‚Ä¶..43.9x. Let me say that again: 43.9x. That‚Äôs saying this weed company that makes virtually no money on a net basis should be trading at higher multiples than even Tesla, one of the most historically high multiple stocks out there. This is so, so, so overvalued. A classic pump.

Just for shits and gigs I did this same analysis just looking at TLRY as a standalone company in the event there is no merger, and at current prices, the EV/LTM Revenue multiple is even higher at 60x. 60!

I just want to make sure you all don‚Äôt get shafted here. You should not be paying this much for a Company with no earnings. Notes these numbers are conservative - I'm not even accounting for further dilution from insider options and convertible securities because you apes probably can't handle it. And don‚Äôt tell me ‚Äúit‚Äôs about the potential‚Äù. Potential isn‚Äôt realized through a press release, and you know it.

Furthermore, legalization takes a long time to implement and these guys aren‚Äôt even US focused. Seriously ‚Äì read their securities filings.

Also, keep in mind this merger was announced in December, and nothing materially altering profitability has been announced since then. WHY THE RUNUP? You're getting fleeced lads.",2021-02-11 10:48:37
Being on the other side of the weed stock rally,73,lhb2m1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhb2m1/being_on_the_other_side_of_the_weed_stock_rally/,163,1613040486.0,"
So weed stocks have been pumping this week. The only catalyst I've found for that is Virginia passing a bill that will legalize it by 2024( https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/virginia-lawmakers-pass-marijuana-legalization-bills-75716927 )

TLRY, APHA, ACB, SNDL, are some of the stocks being bought. My question, is why are people investing in Canadian based weed growers/distributors on potential for it to be federally legal in the United States? Why would it be profitable for the US to import all of its weed in the case that it does become legal on a federal level? Don't international trade tariffs and everything else that goes iwth importing foreign goods make it less than ideal, when compared to growing it domestically? Sure, there is some % that is legal imported for medical use, and research pruposes (TLRY and CGC) but how much is really being imported today, and will it stay like that if its federally legalized in the US. It's not like its that hard to grow it here either - most of the US has a climate for it, and if it doesn't you can build greenhouses. Am I missing something here?

The problem is, there don't seem to be any US based, publicly traded weed growers/distributors. So people just flocked to the Canadian ones. I don't get it.",2021-02-11 10:48:06

Good news there is still a great sleeper play out there . This has been discussed in r/stocks and here in WSB weeks and it‚Äôs simple merger math. 

Buy APHA not TLRY.  Why? Because APHA will convert to TLRY shares for a profit at a .838 to one. In other words 100 shares of APHA will convert to 83.8 TLRY shares.  One TLRY share at close was $63.80  and one APHA only $26.34.

83% of $63.80 is $53.46.

APHA is trading at a $28 per share discount! 

APHA is a great company and actually the one buying TLRY (Reverse merger) the two are poised to do very well with legalization and the tickers will switch in the 2Q of This year.

* Divisiveness, calling people bots and shills because they disagree with you only reduces diversity of thought, and drives away our best members.

* Repetitive content, we have just barely enough IQ points to focus on multiple stocks at once, not everything has to be GME or Weedstocks.

#What you can do to keep this place great

* Upvote new and interesting ideas. No one wants to see the front page filled with threads on the same stock or sector.

* Mock people for not understanding something and doing their research, and don't speak beyond your knowledge.

* Bring your own creative ideas to the table! Pick the dumbest company (over $1B market cap) and really read into their filings and let us know what you find!

* Keep content related to megathread topics in the megathread.

#A note on the moderation team:

The team we currently have (missing you u/zjz) is the best we've ever had. Everyone on this team is entirely committed to keeping the subreddit stable and top notch.

This mod team is a completely different beast than the two mod teams evicted over the past year. They are the ones who have actually put work into the subreddit over the years, and aren't just inactive. They have poured their souls into this sub for years. Yes, some are using throwaways because they'd rather not get doxxed (again), but if my vouch isn't enough, u/zjz vouched for them as well.

Making everyone a mod for a week, paper trading competitions, automod responses, the discord and plenty of other fun facets of the subreddit were done by this very team. If you don't know what I'm talking about at this point, stick around. You'll have a blast.

"NTDOY is the most undervalued company, how do you not see this?",96,lhab8w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lhab8w/ntdoy_is_the_most_undervalued_company_how_do_you/,111,1613038127.0,"Srsly, how has everyone missed this undervalued gem. Let's break this down simple:

1. This thing has a PE ratio under 18 putting its valuation lower than other boring value stocks like Cisco, Comcast, or Walmart. You even get a 1% dividend yield which is more than your Chase saving account provides you. You'd think having such a low PE under JPow's economy would mean this is a dead company with no prospects, but...

2. Their latest game console, the Nintendo Switch which has been out since March 2017 keeps selling units by the millions. 80 million Switch devices sold to date, 15 million of them in 2020 alone. They're still selling at a consistent pace at the mid-cycle of the console's lifespan. This would be bad if they sold it at a loss like new game consoles from the competition, but...

3. The Switch is cheap. You can get the Switch Pro for less than $300, or the lite for $200. When your console is so cheap not only can you sell it at a profit but your customers have more money to buy games. And who makes those games?

4. Nintendo has basically a monopoly on Switch games taking all the profit. This isn't particilarly hard when you own excellent IPs that raise nostalgia levels so high. All their 15 top selling games are self-published, 9 of them solely developed by then. Their top 6 each sold over 20 million copies, they're in 25+% of Switch owners. This is important when you factor in that 80% of games sold in 2020 were released in prior fiscal years so new Switch Owner will buy these same old games that already broke cost. And with such popular IPs they can even release phone quality games or emulated 10-20 year old parts at $50 for cash grabs. Only stronger competition could stop them, but...

5. You can't get a new Playstation or Xbox. Srsly, have you tried buying one? You get a notification from Best Buy that they have some in stock and that same minute when you try adding to cart it's already sold out. Despite the demand, the supply chain is so backlogged that less than 5 million PS5s have been sold.

6. CHINA - did you know that video game consoles were banned there until 2014? The Switch wasn't even launched there officially until 2019. This is a nascent new region for the expansion of the videogame industry, especially today when less than 2 million Switch/Ps4/xbox ones were sold. Of those, 1.3 million were Switch meaning they already have over 2/3s of this nascent new market share. As more chinese come out of poverty and try out these game consoles from their rich software engineer cousins who came to visit them from California, they will demand regulatory change to make it easier for video game consoles to sell in the country.

7. What about growth outside the videogame market? Well, they might be the future leaders of AR games. Mario Kart Live? Mario Legos? What other toy companies have you seen pushing the boundaries of AR? With their excellent IPs it should be easy to dominate the toys market, with total global market size of $100B.

8. All that hype is all well but what to the actual numbers say? Well, this baby had a Q1 - Q3 YoY growth in Net Sales of 37.3%! But there's more! The Operating Profit grew by 98.2% and the Net Profit by a similar 91.8%. How is this not a growth company? Stock is up 67% YoY but keeps being valued at low PE üòÆ

1. Why would you ever put money into a HEXO that‚Äôs up over 100% in the last month that just went through a 4/1 reverse split to be eligible to be put on the NYSE???

Well let me answer that question for you children. HEXO OWNS THE #1 POSITION IN WEED DRINKS IN CANADA! They own 42.5% of Truss, A company that is targeting the 71% of Canadian pussies who get turned off of weed because they have to smoke it. I‚Äôve never met someone who hates being high (under the correct circumstances) but I know a lot of people who hate it smoke. What if they can üçπ it?? Do you understand the potential, currently weed beverages are currently 1.9% of the Canadian market (1.4 US), experts agree that weed bev‚Äôs can grow to 15% weeds total sales

2. But let‚Äôs talk about how much money are they are losing... because they did lose $170m million in the Q2. They only lost 4.2m in Q3üöÄüöÄ. Not to mention CGC, currently having one of the largest market cap evaluations at 20B market cap only posted 440M net rev, compared to HEXO‚Äôs 41M with only a 1.24B market cap. Now let‚Äôs get to what everyone wants to here about. Are they really growing though? 

3. TLDR on weed stance 

Heavily invested in Quebec, Greece, and Colorado. They aren‚Äôt branding any further currently (waiting for American legalization imo). They produce way more bud then they can sell but because the price of a gram has fallen from 5.29 last year to under $3 now they have been able to ram up sales and cut their net losses to only 4milly last q. They are still producing 50% more weed than they can sell ready for a wave of legalization to expand their cannibals reach.

Main highlights highlights. Up 114% in gross revenue from the comparative prior year. Net revenue is up 103%. Expanding reach into Alberta(18% total sales), Ontario(15%), and British Columbia(6%). They have the #1 market share in Quebec. Each province having a strong tourist presence. They currently have 150m in straight cash.

The SEC has previously warned that short sellers can hide their shorts through some trickery with the help of market makers. Well we have data reported by FINRA showing how much naked short selling was done by market makers through the end of January too, there was an explosion of 4.6 million shares of Short Exempt Volume by market makers, which could have been used to help short sellers hide their positions. (FINRA notes they don‚Äôt capture all data, and their total trading volume seems to be a little less than half that shown on Yahoo Finance. Thus presumably to account for the full trading volume of activity we need to more than double the sample FINRA publishes. In other words **10.2 million shares could have been hidden by market makers given the high Short Exempt Volume through the end of January**.)

\--

[Link](https://postimg.cc/47jdfqtF) of the data pulled from FINRA, notice the jump in Short Exempt Volume highlighted in yellow starting January 13th, showing market makers selling naked shorts. Notice how the Short Exempt Volume has only grown as we moved into February, even though overall trading volume has trended down. This indicated to me that the market makers might be playing a larger role in hiding even more shorts in February potentially.

Combining the official short shares and the potentially hidden short shares, we get to 31.6 million shares, representing 67% of float at the end of January.

\--

FINRA data shows short sales represented more than half of FINRA trading volume throughout February, leading to the conclusion shorts have been increasing their stake against the company again opportunistically at higher prices this month. Some of the shorting likely was done by high frequency algos that typically close their position by day end, but the short volumes were so high it would be impossible to close all the shorts out given the limited volume. If there were no other buyers, and only short sellers opening and closing their positions throughout February, conservatively there would be a net 11.8 million new shorts that went unclose based on FINRA data, and if that is inflated to account for the trading volume FINRA is not capturing, then there may have been a total of **29.1 million new shares shorted in February**.

\--

Bringing it all together.

21.4 million short shares officially reported by FINRA for end of January.

\+10.2 million shares potentially hidden by market makers through Short Exempt Volume in January.

\+29.1 million new shares shorted through February 9th.

**60.7 million shares short in total through February 9th by my estimates, representing 129% of float presently.**

\--

The table below shows a rough estimate of the cumulative portion of shorts that would be underwater with losses at each price point. This was roughly estimated using the price ranges and short volumes by trading day. A**t a $50 share price around 40% of the shorts are underwater by my estimates, and at a $100 share price around 75% would be underwater, and by a price of $150 more than 80% of shorts would be underwater.** In other words, going above those price points would put pressure on an increasingly larger portion of the shorts to close out their positions.

$450 = 98%

$400 = 96%

$350 = 94%

$300 = 92%

$250 = 88%

$200 = 84%

$150 = 81%

$100 = 74%

$50 = 42%

\--

This analysis can be improved upon with more detailed trading volume data by the minute, but this was based on day end volumes and price ranges. It also assumes the official short shares reports by FINRA at the end of January only represent about a third of all the shorts that actually exist today. Despite being very rough estimates, these are intended to illustrate the prices that may potentially be key pain point prices for short sellers.

\--

**TLDR - shorts are hiding their shorts position which the SEC is aware of. A lot of short exempt volume in the last couple of weeks. Short interest is most likely at 129% vs 78%. üöÄüöÄüöÄ**

[GME] Volume vs Price Linear Regression Analysis. A comparison with AMC + Others,439,lh99ir,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh99ir/gme_volume_vs_price_linear_regression_analysis_a/,183,1613034896.0,"Hey everyone,

I'll start off by saying this is not financial advice, do you baby. I'll also say I'm NOT an expert. I had some experience trading before the GME hype, mainly in ETFs, and I've taken Finance courses in college, but that's it. 

In any case, I noticed how weirdly correlated the GME Volume and Price were as I watched my gambling money wash away. But that was purely anecdotal. So I wrote a simple script to pull the Volume and Price of 10 stocks, including GME and AMC, every 60 seconds or so. [This was pulling directly from Yahoo! Finance, here's GME as an example](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/). The script was just looking for the Volume and Price on each stock's page. The tickers I chose are:

* AMC
* ATVI
* GM
* GME
* JPM
* SNDL
* SNOW
* TSLA
* UPS
* V


The criteria was just ""fairly popular stocks"", so if you all have suggestions of other stocks you'd want to see, feel free to comment.


I left this script running from 1:47 PM until 7:02 PM, which gave me a total of 210 observations per stock. The scrape failed twice, once for GME and once for ATVI, so I have 209 observations for those.


What I found was surprising to me, but I am not savvy enough to know if this is a ""sign"" of anything. So I'm leaving it up to you apes. [Here's an album with the Regression Analysis results from each of those tickers](https://imgur.com/a/U7myXa2). You'll notice that the R^2 for GME is off the charts, at 90.7%. The second highest is TSLA, with 70.9%, followed by UPS, at 68.5%. 
 Here's a general definition of R^2 : 
>R-squared is a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination, or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. 0% indicates that the model explains none of the variability of the response data around its mean.

Here are the R^2 values for all 10 stocks (all in the album above):

* AMC: 0.6766
* ATVI: 0.579
* GM: 0.0012
* GME: 0.907
* JPM: 0.6203
* SNDL: 0.3488
* SNOW: 0.0948
* TSLA: 0.7087
* UPS: 0.6852
* V: 0.39


I believe this is telling us that there is an extremely strong correlation between the Volume movement and the Price movement, so as the volume goes up, price goes up, as the volume goes down, price goes down. This relationship is also much much stronger than in any other stock. So what can/does this mean? I cannot conclude if this is shady or not, but with everything else going on (weird sub behavior, media blitz, RH being ass), I can't help but think this is odd. And my point here is not to claim I've made some ground-breaking discovery, I'm looking to use the data we have available to better assess my GME position. My current ""reasoning"" for holding is that there's a lot of ""weird"" things going on and each one is getting brushed off individually as ""maybe it's this, maybe it's that"". The point of this post is to add to that weird pile (what your wife's bf calls you).

PS: I understand this is an overly simplistic model, with one variable. I also understand my observations are from one day and the sample size is not large enough to make perfect conclusions.

Most of the tickers thrown around in this sub havn‚Äôt had a single profitable quarter. Sure revenues are up, costs are down but the revenues aren‚Äôt up enough and costs aren‚Äôt down enough. Can this business operate in the black today? Because if they can‚Äôt then expansing to a larger facility won‚Äôt solve their woes. 

There‚Äôs a saying in martial arts: If you can‚Äôt do it slow, you can‚Äôt do it fast. So pick a weed grower that can grow and sell their product for a profit. This should be the backbone of any op. Income from stakes in other businesses or changes in valuation of inventory are some tricks used to cook the books. You‚Äôll see many of these tickers issue shares, warrants whatever and that is your sign to gtfo.

So who is profitable? AFAIK APHA pre-TLRY merger. I‚Äôm not confident APHA can turn around the TLRY operation. I‚Äôd look at MSOs that are operating in the black for my picks for the coming green rush. Good luck all and remember: SHIT WEED DONT SELL.",2021-02-11 09:07:35
The weed rally has nothing to do with GME,4570,lh8ui6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh8ui6/the_weed_rally_has_nothing_to_do_with_gme/,707,1613033633.0,"No, the upward movement in cannabis stocks is not a concerted distraction by Wall Street to take attention away from GME. Believe it or not, but a global stock market can contain numerous trends all at once. The weed stocks rallied because of the belief that broader cannabis legalization is possible in the next 12-18 months under a Biden administration. Remember: the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill decriminalizing cannabis last December, only for that legislation to die in the Senate, still controlled by the GOP. Now that Dems have control of the White House and both chambers of Congress, cannabis has a much more clear and easy path towards legalization. Obviously that would be enormous for the marijuana industry, so people are grabbing shares now, ahead of the potential explosion in growth. Also, a lot of these stocks were shorted and are now getting squeezed. None of this has anything to do with GME.",2021-02-11 08:53:53

As a resident of the UK I feel there is going to be a big media and public push for rapid legalisation soon as it is a full no-brainier and I know nobody who is vehemently against it.

They have clearly started to look at this in Westminster and given the Tories progressive agenda coupled with a need for new industries to grow I think that looking at companies with Uk access is a great start. With Brexit done and Canada‚Äôs commonwealth links I can see big opportunities on the horizon for certain Canadian weed conglomerates.

#Major competitor

The current competition is IDEXX Laboratories (NASDAQ: $IDXX). It's worth noting that vets currently have to send off samples to these guys and not only is it expensive, but it causes delays in diagnosis (days). TRUFORMA allows for the same tests to take place, on-site at a fraction of the price within 18 minutes. Key members of the IDEXX team have left the company to join Zomedica.

#News and upcoming catalysts

Zomedica had 2 fantastic weeks, it's price is rising since they announced truforma will be launched at the end of March.

&nbsp;
When the stock price was at almost $3 they announced a *BOUGHT DEAL* to rise 173.5 millions dollars at $1.90 per share. Surprisingly this happened just 2 days ago and the price already recovered and is now around $2.55 per share.

&nbsp;
Zomedica announced that the money will be used to speed up the research and launch of new products.

&nbsp;
 As of today Zomedica is **DEBT FREE**

&nbsp;
The upcoming financial annual report that will be published at the end of this month, the announcement of a new big potential investor who bought the offered shares, and certain news about Truforma when close to launch could really trigger an unprecedented rise of this stock.

&nbsp;
By investing today you could easily have a share worth up to $8 on product launch, or even double digits when they'll be announcing new incoming products and patents. This is a stock that has common sudden bull runs and a community of retailers who are expecting to hold their shares for years.

There will not be another GME for like a *decade*

Hence some were actually caught with their pants down and paid dearly for it - and for you to be in on it in time is pure dumb luck *squared*

To you retards who are trying to look for another: **Stop trying to make ""retail short squeeze"" happen its not gonna happen,** ***especially just weeks after GME***

BB Stock long term.

The main appeal for investing in BB involves the electric vehicle industry since BB is developing a QNX software that will run autonomous vehicles.  Blackberry‚Äôs QNX platform is designed to protect data communication within the vehicle and the ‚Äúproduct makes the countless nodes of data communication in embedded systems functionally safe.‚Äù

Baidu Inc. (BIDU) has partnered with BB to use the QNX software in their vehicles. If Blackberry plays its cards right, the QNX software could be used in a multitude of different things. They could implement the QNX software into multiple car makes and models, and even use the software in other types of vehicles outside of just automobiles.

On the other hand, BB's QNX software could crumble if it is not competitive and there are better options for car manufacturers.

So what is everyone's opinion on BB? Why should you invest in them, and/or why shouldn't you invest in them? I am still doing my research and would love to talk about this.

EDIT: BB is also very strong in cybersecurity. 9/10 of the worlds largest banks use BB security software to secure data. ",2021-02-11 07:38:11

&#x200B;

SNDL?  For real?  Dude....

&#x200B;

Hi all, NrdRage here.  You might remember me from such hits as ""pegging $GME dead right multiple times during its bubble, making everybody rich on $RIOT, exposing the $PLUG infinite money glitch, accidentally helping start the $BB craze, never getting an $AMD weekly call right and being in an abusive relationship with the VIX"" or maybe ""The SEC and you:  How you can just say no to having them shove a Mister Fister up your ass"".  Alright, apes, it's been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks, you make money.  It's been a great run.  But if you're going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with, you gotta start thinking a bit.  And that means - hear me out - thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of SNDL alive.  And yes, I realize I'm saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last 24 hours.  Look, I was playing it, too.  I grabbed some 2/19 3c's and a shit ton of 1/22 1.5c's on Tuesday.  I also got out of both of those today, though not as high up as I could have.  If you check my history, you'll see I even said I was goingt to eye a re-entry.  Then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry, but I passed on it because I had done some research by that point.  Whatever, profit's profit.

&#x200B;

Here's the TL:DR:  It's basically a penny stock that's gotten pumped to hell.  But the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees.

&#x200B;

Hey, I love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy, I ain't gonna talk shit about that.  But it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this, and I'm starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about Holding to 42.69 and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly don't even know what they fuck they've invested in that the GME Gibbons fell for.

&#x200B;

# Here's the reality of SNDL:

&#x200B;

The company was on the verge of bankruptcy around Thanksgiving, they have no other markets other than Canada, which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram.  And they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet THC content requirements.

&#x200B;

In case you're wondering what that means, it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper.  They sell garbage.  And everyone knows it - their brand is associated with low quality crap.

&#x200B;

Plus, they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price, then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering.  Now, to their credit, this not only enabled them to become debt free, but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand.  Don't get too excited, fucking Sam's Choice at Wal-Mart is a brand, too, doesn't mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum.  By reason of them selling skunkweed, their margins lag well behind that of their competitors.

&#x200B;

Looking at their financials, they've got 615 million in cash laying around.  That's pretty good - except  they're a company that burns 250 million a quarter.  Which means they're going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month.  They've got no exposure to the US market, but had no problem dropping ""rumors"" that they were going to break in to the US market through licensing deals - which turned out to be 1 pot shop in Bellingham, Washington.  They have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world, for that matter.

&#x200B;

# B...bu.....bu.bu....BUT NRDRAGE!  Stonk go up !  Look at it!  SNDL to the moon!  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ ).

&#x200B;

Yeah, I know.  It's fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when it's seemingly mid flight.  But here I am anyways.  Not to talk you out of the weed party - you should totally keep playing that for all it's worth - but rather to get people to see that they've probably outgrown skunkweed now.

&#x200B;

Look, the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar.  Hell, it was 13 cents not too far back.  With a stock worth a dollar, it's easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz.  It's easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra 10 bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere.  But as the price goes up, so too goes up the perceived cost of entering.  I can make a strong (unassailable, in fact), argument that $APHA at $25 is cheaper than SNDL at 3.25.  But people are conditioned to like smaller numbers.  Unfortunately, as the GME Gibbons learned, eventually you run out of buyers, and then things go tits up real fast.

&#x200B;

As the Prophet Biggie Smalls once said, Mo' Money Equals Mo' Problems.  We all know this equation to be true.  And here you are, sitting on bags of bananas you didn't know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadn't heard of before yesterday.  You don't think you've got a problem, but you do.  Because those bags of bananas aren't edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash.  If you're sitting on  bananas from the gold standard of the weed world (that would be, $TLRY), you're resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas.  There are gonna be lots of bananas to go around, and mostly we're just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later.  But you don't have that with SNDL.  All the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher.  You can't all be right, especially when there are billions of bananas, and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some Boomer on CNBC told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler.

&#x200B;

# Again, I'm not telling you to leave the party

&#x200B;

But, if you recall your dorm room years, the best pizza you could afford was the Tony's school lunchroom style shit for a dollar.  Then you managed to  hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans, and you upgraded to Domino's.  Maybe by now you're ordering from a local joint that makes it's own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old Italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot 3 times while making it.  That just makes it taste better.  That's science.  But I digress.

&#x200B;

The point is, you can get better weed now.  You don't have to smoke the skunk.  So before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again, maybe you should elevate your enterprise.  Let's take a look at your options:

&#x200B;

# Canopy Growth

You could go with $CGC.  They not only sell higher quality weed, but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think Burning Man isn't just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their ""luck"".  They've captured that all important 65+ stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures, cataracts, and dry vag, so they've got a lot of revenue.  They've also had a much more muted rise this week because they just haven't been on everybody's lips, which means they've got a lot of room to run.  The downside here is they burn almost as much cash as SNDL, but they've also got more bullets.

&#x200B;

# Aurora

If you go with $ACB, you're going with a company that's already gone through its ""shady as fuck"" stage and has re-emerged healthy from it.  You're also not only getting on weed, but the DIY urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed.  They, too, have had a strong run, but have a lot more runway than most because they've actually got a really strong path to dominance in the US market once it opens up to them.

&#x200B;

# Organigram:

&#x200B;

Look, if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or you've only got 28 dollars to invest, you could do a lot worse.  They've got strong branding, large growth potential, a management structure that doesn't seem to act shady, and they've run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks, but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit.

&#x200B;

# Tilray and Aphria:

&#x200B;

I'm combining these because they're inexorably joined at the hip (or should be, more on that later) because the two of them are merging.  For those who don't know, sometime in Q2, every share of $APHA you own will turn into .833 shares of $TLRY.  Even though APHA is the one buying out TLRY.    This is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery.  When you start investing in these, you know you're a real investor.

&#x200B;

Here's the interesting thing with these guys, though.  Even though APHIA should be just slightly trailing behind TLRY in terms of stock price, it's currently trading at less than half.  With TLRY sitting at 73 a share as I write this, APHA should be at just over $60.  But it's at 29.  Now, obviously, this means that TLRY has a lot more momentum, and some of that is due to the fact that there's a mini (don't flog me for using the word, but it's true) short squeeze going on with that one, which has turned it into such a strong momentum play.  But APHA, by virtue of actual math, needs to be within about 17% of TLRY's price.  Which means APHA either needs to moon dramatically, or TLRY needs to fall precipitously.  Now either of those things could happen, but the momentum of TLRY is hard to stop, which means it's more likely that APHA rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months.  Even if TLRY does falter, that means APHA still has to come up a bit to meet it.  Making APHA kind of a ""can't go tits up"" situation.  TLRY also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it, whereas SNDL is too small to meet most of their requirements.    Which can further propel TLRY (and thus, drag APHA with it).

&#x200B;

One of the interesting things that's been happening with this pair is that the order books, even though they should mirror one another, have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days.  This, of course, was a bull flag for TLRY every time it happened, leaving APHA to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter.  It's really easy money.

&#x200B;

Fundamentally, these guys have one HUUUUUUUGE advantage over the others:  They secured the UK distribution, and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the Europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them.  And if you don't think they won't be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the US opens for business, then you definitely ain't black.

&#x200B;

# Or, you can just stay where you are and do the  üíéüëê thing

&#x200B;

Ask the $GME Gibbons how well that worked out for them.  The ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the Viper Room, still rocking his mullet and chain wallet, just convinced that Warrant and Slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that Queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again.  It's just sad.  You're flying right now, but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then you're gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that it's gonna be OK and that you're gonna ride it to a thousand one day.  Lots of us (myself included) made a fuck ton of money on GME.  And we've made a fuck ton on SNDL and the rest of the Weedies this week.  But there are always people who Melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck.  That's gonna be a lot of you, but you shouldn't let it be you.

&#x200B;

# TL:DR:  Smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from SNDL while you're way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes.  Plaintains equals breeding with better apes, not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases.

I will be going in HEAVY on this one. 

Reasons being:

1) Covid. The amount of single people right now outweigh people in relationships (loser lost of you autists fucking your hand) 
2) GME AMC and all that brought an entire new species of people to be trading. 
3) A lot of the new traders are looking to make back their bucks from GME AMC etc
4) People can relate to and with Bumble. All of them are on it or using it to get laid so therefore I think it will have a ton of people interested. 

Hopefully there will be options availabe.

No change; better than down, however.

Moving forward, I think I'll start posting HIMX stuff weekly instead of daily, and post it as a DISCUSSION.

  

My thoughts on HIMX have not changed.  I still think it's still in a major upcycle - with some possible pullbacks and consolidation, which is a good thing.  Allows folks the chance to get some who didn't have the opportunity before.

I know it is a hard pill to swallow. Like most victims of scammers, you are too embarrassed to admit you have been scammed.

By blocking the squeeze, they literally took  money from our pockets. Your money is gone. GME, BB, AMC, et al. stocks were counterfeited, the price reduced, and your money is gone. 

Believing that the federal reserve is going to allow you to fuck up their scamming game called the stock market is laughable. 

I lost some money too, but not a lot. If you want to hold, by all means, d so. But, to buy this stock thinking it's going to go back up to $500+, it's preposterous. 

When you bet, sometimes you lose. When you bet against the federal reserve: heads they win- tails you lose.

Been here for a few months, know a bit, but I'm more of an expert in aircraft. Recently, as you may know, Boeing suffered several major issues with their 737 MAX aircraft, resulting in a 100 USD plunge. Soon after, the Corona virus appeared no less than a year later, resulting in an additional 200 USD plunge. They couldn't just stop the production line, and thus it resulted in Boeing having to [park dozens of their aircraft in the employee parking lot.](https://images.indianexpress.com/2019/06/boeing-737-max-grounded-parking-lot-759.jpg)

However, that's not important. What is important is the recent news that the 737 MAX is now allowed to fly once again, after being grounded since early 2019. This is also in line with the vaccine role out, which is likely going to result in a $BA surge back to it's original price or higher, due to the significant want to travel. Luckily for Boeing, they've got dozens of aircraft already prepped for use, they just need to sell them again. While the stock has been slow to recover, it looks like it will rebound and swing for the fences as airports reopen and people want to travel after being locked inside for so long, leading to a lucrative opportunity in the near future.

Because they were fish and they were retarded they did not know why they were keeping the wall up, they just kept holding. And holding, and holding. As the wall got **smaller** and **smaller** and **smaller**.

This inevitably **cost the fish** lots of energy. So much energy that getting the wall any higher seemed an impossibility. The retarded fish had **no other ideas** and they bickered with each other and snapped at each other for many days. 

Along came a Snail with an **idea so obvious** to him that it was **laughable** that the fish could not see it. Maybe they were just **too close to the problem**. Maybe they were **greedy** and each fish wanted the wall for himself. Maybe they were all retarded. Maybe **they enjoyed being anally reamed**. That it was a pleasure for them to be penetrated so. 

The idea was simple. All it really involved was **leverage**. But the retarded fish didn't understand what leverage meant. They **gave that up to build the wall** in the first place. They had no idea what leverage looked like when they had it themselves. Stupid retarded fish, **leverage is what you are holding,** spoke the Snail.

By dropping that wall, falling back and building the wall at **lower level**, with many **more fish**. They could build a wall that would keep the snakes out. All it would take is some coordination between the **Big Fish** and the **Little Fish**. The **Little Fish** could **retreat** and get ready to build the wall from a **comfortable foundation**. The **Big Fish** could **throw stones** at the snakes **one at a time.** Potentially knocking one out. Once at a level that was desirable and **approachable** from both Big Fish and Little Fish, the Wall could be built on **solid foundations**. Gradually the Fish could **collect stones** for the next push forward **with reinforcements**.

The **Snakes** would relish the opportunity for advancement and **overextend themselves**. They would lead themselves into a **point of no return**. But for the tenacity of the Retarded Fish. Once they get an idea in their heads, it is very hard to change their minds.

But the retarded fish thought the Snails idea was stupid. ""**Leverage**,"" they said ""What's a wall got to do with **Leverage**? Go away crazy Snail. You clearly don't know anything about walls or how to build them. We spent all this energy building this **stupid shitty wall** to this height, you want us to **take it down**. You sound like a snake, you sound like a robot! Psssh... **Leverage**, who does this Snail think he is?!""

The Snail sighed again, as looked upon the struggling fish. He forgave them for their insults. They **did not recognise him** or know he was. They could not see past his **clever disguise,** disguised as a Snail as he was. They did not **know the names** he carried with him in his time. Or the **many battles he had already won**, very similar to this one. If he told them they would never believe him, the Retarded Fish **only believed what was on the screen** in front of them. **As the image of the Wall went down** and down and further down and back up again and down again. Caught in an **endless stalemate**.

**Poor Retarded Fish**! Such a **simple existence** they must get to live, building a wall, only to watch it fall down again and again... It must be **so hard** being Retarded Fish all day. If only they would **try the Snails idea** even if **for lack of a better one**. It's not as if they weren't a **bunch of losers** already. 

**Determined** they were, **to waste more energy**. The Wise Snail looked on and laughed as each day passed and **the Wall the Retarded Fish Built got smaller and smaller**.

I'm here today to tell you about 2 good gold miner stocks I did my DD on, B2Gold \[$BTG\] and Yamana Gold \[$AUY\]!

My DD on B2Gold goes as follows. ITS UNDERVALUED! BTG produces 1 million OZ of Shiny pretty GOLD a year, has practically no debt (121k as of start of 2020). Half a billion cash on hand! Has a P/E Ratio of 8. The dividend the company pays is $0.04/share quarterly. The sales revenue in 2015 was 708.33 Million and in 2019 it was 1.53 Billion, year 2020 will probably top 2019 since gold price went up. Total assets of the company are at around 3.48 Billion while the liabilities are 818.79 Million. Gross Income in 2019 was $597.71 Million. The price of a stock is currently sitting at $5.05 Which is laughably undervalued .üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Yamana Gold \[$AUY\] Slightly worse than B2Gold but still worthy stonk! Price per share currently at $4.91. Total debt at the beginning of 2020 was $991K. Gross Income in 2019 was $446 Million. It has a dividend of 0.02/share quarterly . P/E Ratio of 40 which is kind of poor. But the company is still worth way more than the sub $5 price it's currently at! The company is targeting production of gold to exceed 1 million oz per year! It also produces silver which is an additional bonus!¬†üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Full disclosure I'm 2000 Shares deep in B2Gold, average at $4.97 and 700 shares in Yamana Gold with an average of $4.84 per share.üíéü§≤üíéü§≤

TLRY is going to the moon. Today it closed at $63.91 and is now sitting at $76.41 after hours as I write this. The highest call option for Friday the 12th is $65. There are a total of 30,555 option contracts listed in the option chain. If TLRY closes above $65 on Friday, I think there will be a lot of buying pressure. Also, the latest short interest report from 1/29 listed a short interest of 51% of the float. Perhaps many of those shorts were closed today during the massive trading volume today. Perhaps they werent. 

TLRY also was granted clearance to import and distribute their products in the UK this week. Last week they were given the first (and only) clearance to sell their medical cannabis products in portugal. Looking at the news articles, it seems they are also selling in Spain and Germany.

I think it could double over the next six months, and am in $35 LEAPs. Earnings are after market Wednesday Feb 17th.

The [U.S. Department of Commerce just determined](https://www.accesswire.com/628789/US-Department-of-Commerce-Issues-Final-Affirmative-Countervailing-Duty-Determinations-on-Phosphate-Fertilizer-Imports-from-Morocco-and-Russia) that phosphate fertilizer imports from Morocco and Russia, major players in the phosphate fertilizer arena, are unfairly subsidized, with subsidy rates of (a) 19.97 percent for Moroccan producer OCP (b) 9.19 percent and 47.05 percent for Russian producers PhosAgro and EuroChem, respectively, and a rate of 17.2 percent for all other producers/exporters. The U.S. International Trade Commission has a concurrent investigation to determine whether Moroccan and Russian phosphate fertilizer imports materially injure the U.S. phosphate fertilizer industry, with a final ruling is expected by mid-March. If the ITC's ruling is affirmative, then Commerce will issue countervailing duty orders, which will remain in place for at least five years. At a time when supply chains are fragmented and food prices are quietly inflating (see below), the U.S. is protecting its own.

Food price inflation may still largely be unnoticeable in the grocery store, but there are signs elsewhere. Look at the 1year charts for:

Currently Tilray and Aphria are being mispriced by the market assuming a deal goes through. I see the deal as very likely to happen. The conversion rate for Aphria shares into Tilray shares is 0.8381 which means for every Aphria share you own you get .8381 shares of Tilray. Right now, Tilray is trading around $63 per share. This means that theoretically Aphria should be worth around $52 at the close of the deal. Currently Aphria is trading at a 50% discount. Is the market assuming the deal won‚Äôt go through? Is Tilray only going up because of a short squeeze? Seems like a good opportunity for a pair trade at this crazy discount.

$TRXC (TransEnterix): already over 1B market cap (DD),144,lh35xq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh35xq/trxc_transenterix_already_over_1b_market_cap_dd/,158,1613018131.0,"Dear tards and ladymen,

**DOES EVERY SINGLE POST HAVE TO BE A SHITPOST ABOUT APES BAGHOLDING FUCKING $GME AND OTHER NEWFAG STUFF TO GET ANY ATTENTION?**

**YES, THE MARKET CAP IS OVER 1B, STOP CHECKING RETARDED WEBSITES AND, IN DOUBT, CALCULATE IT YOURSELVES** [**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/trxc?ltr=1**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/trxc?ltr=1)

**TL;DR:**

**The rocket is taking off. Company good, system good, money not much. Competitor much money. Company promising. Shares cheap cheap, tendies lots. Shares is the play.**

today I want to bring $TRXC to your attention. I know you already know this stock, but bear with me. It has just crossed 1B market cap in a pretty awesome rally that started only a couple days ago, and it has grown over +46% today at the time of writing this DD.

But... who are $TRXC, you may ask?

TransEnterix build the devices... no, fuck this, the BATTLESTATIONS for surgeons to operate with the minimally invasive procedure known as laparoscopy ([https://www.healthline.com/health/laparoscopy#:\~:text=Laparoscopy%2C%20also%20known%20as%20diagnostic,look%20at%20the%20abdominal%20organs](https://www.healthline.com/health/laparoscopy#:~:text=Laparoscopy%2C%20also%20known%20as%20diagnostic,look%20at%20the%20abdominal%20organs).). Their system is called SENHANCE. Essentially, a robotic device pokes some holes in your tummy and, without opening you up for good, some little arms with tools, cameras, light... are introduced in your poor unfit office body to fix whatever is broken. Afterwards, the holes are stitched together and you can recover quickly and with fewer marks.

OK, OK, you may say, ""why should this shit interest me? Does this not exist already? How do they do it?"". I am glad you ask! This does exist, yes, and the industry standard is the well-known Da Vinci surgical system ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da\_Vinci\_Surgical\_System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Da_Vinci_Surgical_System)) by Intuitive Surgical ($ISRG). So what the fuck is interesting about $TRXC? A couple things:

\- Senhance is a more modern system, with haptic feedback and even fucking eye tracking for camera control. SAUCES:

[https://www.massdevice.com/transenterix-bets-haptics-senhance-robot-assisted-surgery-device/](https://www.massdevice.com/transenterix-bets-haptics-senhance-robot-assisted-surgery-device/)

The concept is that the surgeon and the machine FUSE INTO ONE, becoming, you know, a Robocop or something like that.

\- TransEnterix bets for AI-POWERED MACHINE VISION to, for example, make the system's camera automatically follow the tools being used and this beast already has THE CE SIGN FOR COMMERCIALIZATION IN EUROPE AND FDA CLEARANCE. SAUCES:

\- They have started training surgeons in Japan to conquer their market:

[https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/transenterix-announces-establishment-of-japanese-training-center-for-senhance-surgical-system/](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/transenterix-announces-establishment-of-japanese-training-center-for-senhance-surgical-system/)

\- And know the boring fundamentals:

Market Cap 1.182B (at the moment of typing this)

Public float 136.01M

Shares outstanding 176M

You can forget about P/E but LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT ITS COMPETITOR, $ISRG:

Market cap 91.62B

Public float 116.49M

Shares outstanding: 117.56M

So while the shares outstanding and the float are admittedly larger for $TRXC, they are still extremely undervalued if they are to be compared with their competitor which is trading, at the moment, at $788 per share. Of course, of course, it's a small company and establishing new surgical standards is complicated but, to me, they look like a steal EVEN AT THE CURRENT PRICE. And... wanna see how much they were in the past?

[Oh yes, they were worth a couple dollars more...](https://preview.redd.it/h8spk6lbnpg61.png?width=1667&format=png&auto=webp&s=ea84da4efc9f9d94e6650c9ee908dfa2706401e1)

EDIT3: I don't have time to write too much about it right now (this already ate up my fun time today), but their management is also pretty good:

[https://transenterix.com/about/our-management-team](https://transenterix.com/about/our-management-team)

Might write something on them in the following days.

EDIT4: I did find more fun time. Some doctors in Germany wrote a paper on Senhance, testing its feasibility, and compared it to Da Vinci:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-00980-9](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-00980-9)

The comparison with Da Vinci points out the reduced cost of using Senhance:

>\[..\] the ability to utilize conventional laparoscopic 5- and 10-mm trocars stands out in comparison to the da Vinci¬Æ robotic system which incorporates its own 8- and 12-mm ports \[[27](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11701-019-00980-9#ref-CR27)\]. Since fully reusable instruments are used by this surgical robotic system, an advantage regarding cost efficacy is expected when compared to the da Vinci¬Æ system. Excluding the acquisition costs of the Senhance‚Ñ¢ Surgical Robotic System, the robot-specific cost per case at our department was 800 Euros, covering the expenses for drapes, instruments and maintenance according to a flat rate-based service contract. This comes in contrast to costs as high as 1700 Euros for drapes and instruments with da Vinci¬Æ robotic system while excluding maintenance and acquisition costs.

TL; DR: excluding maintenance and acquisition costs, each operation using Da Vinci ($ISRG) costs more than DOUBLE what it costs using Senhance ($TRXC).

And another paper:

[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-01000-6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11701-019-01000-6)

This paper is not accessible for free, so let me just copy the conclusions for you autists to salivate:

>Our experience with diferent types of robotic surgeries allows us to state that the Senhance¬Æ robotic system is feasible and safe for general surgery, gynecology, and urology, and a wider implementation of this system worldwide is simply **a question of time**.

EDIT5: VIRTUAL INVESTOR DAY ON FEB 23. [https://ir.transenterix.com/events-and-presentations](https://ir.transenterix.com/events-and-presentations)

EDIT6: Article from investorplace [https://investorplace.com/2021/02/trxc-stock-will-do-well-over-time-now-that-it-has-enough-capital-to-survive/](https://investorplace.com/2021/02/trxc-stock-will-do-well-over-time-now-that-it-has-enough-capital-to-survive/)

>With $90 million in the bank, TransEnterix can last at least eight quarters at this rate. However, the truth is the company is likely to continue to raise capital, especially as its stock price rises. Therefore I don‚Äôt think that TransEnterix will run out of cash to fund its operations.

EDIT7: To complete this DD a little bit: ""Camisa, why do you only say good things about this company? Why are they so cheap and how come their value has changed so dramatically over time?"". OF COURSE there are downsides to the company. For example, how do you explain that they have been around so long and only have systems in 11 hospitals? Well, that's the thing: they haven't sold so many thus far. But this is also the reason why they have been forced to add functionality to become competitive. Whether this is the one time they succeed for good, I do not know - I only have two balls and neither of them is made of crystal. They seem to be turning things around though and I am jacked to the tits.",2021-02-11 04:35:31

There is a case for GME, given the new CEO/CTO, console cycle, and massive short interest/short position (even at the real 42-43% SI and 21m SP). Those are factual events and numbers. What isn't the case are bagholders who have less of an understanding of the stock market than u/1r0nyman. It's one thing to hype up GME as a resurgent mecca in retail. It's another thing to **not understand how certain metrics are calculated, when/how data is reported, and blatantly make up numbers** because it fits a delusional reality where GME is going to be $10000/share. I'm not saying GME isn't ripe for another squeeze, but be reasonable. Think about what certain share prices mean and the odds it could ever reach such a height.

When you dispute data from Bloomberg Terminal, the holy grail of Wall Street trading, you've lost the investing game. It's not even a casino-level bet, it's throwing cash into a fire pit and pouring piss martinis over it. Don't downvote someone because they disagree with your reality, challenge them. We all have opinions, and we can think the other degenerate's opinion is flat out dumb. But if your DD doesn't hold water, then it truly is dumb.

The Real Deep Fucking Value ‚Äì KT Corporation,1832,lh2ng0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh2ng0/the_real_deep_fucking_value_kt_corporation/,732,1613016829.0,"Apparently we‚Äôre all saying this now, but I am not a financial advisor and you should do your own DD.  With that being said, I present you with the following:


I‚Äôm a fan of DFV the man, but I‚Äôm more interested in really **really** deep fucking value.  This will likely be a long post, but I think you‚Äôll find value in it if you can follow along (see what I did there?).  


For those of you kids who can‚Äôt read good, I‚Äôll put the **TLDR** right here at the top:  KT Corp ($KT) is so undervalued it‚Äôs almost fucking embarrassing.   When I say undervalued, I don‚Äôt mean by a little bit‚Ä¶ I mean if this thing doubled it would still be a good value.  At the time of my writing this, KT is trading at $10.62.  **A realistic price target, if the market were to properly value this company, is ~$30.00**  I‚Äôll go in depth as to why as we continue through this story, but the long and short of it is the Tangible Book Value of KT Corporation is $19.66/share.  What does that mean?  It means if KT declared bankruptcy tomorrow, was forced to sell off all of its tangible assets and pay back its debt, the remaining money to be returned to shareholders would be $19.66/share.  This does not take into consideration intangible assets ‚Äì which have real value (in the $BILLIONS), but are harder to assess.  Again, it‚Äôs trading at $10.62 as of this writing (a price/tangible book value of only 0.54).  Value investors typically look for stocks trading at <3.0 price/TBV.  Deep value would be <1.0.  KT is trading at 0.54, and a price/book ratio of 0.42!  


Shares are cheap, options are cheap.  Do what you will ‚Äì hell, sell it short if you want ‚Äì but I like shares and calls.


**KT CORPORATE PROFILE**

KT Corporation (formerly Korea Telecom) is a South Korean integrated telecom conglomerate which was founded in 1885 ‚Äì but realistically in 1981 in a more noticeable form ‚Äì with business operations sprinkled throughout Asia, Africa, USA & Poland.  KT is South Korea‚Äôs first telecom company and dominates Korean market share in many of the spaces in which they compete:


**Line of Business** | **% of Korean Market Share**
:--|--:
Mobile Services | 31.4%
Fixed-line local telephone & VoIP | 64.9%
Broadband Internet Access | 40.9%
Pay TV Services | 31.6%


As a conglomerate, KT has their hands in a number of diversified pots.

**Products & Services** | **% of Total Revenue**
:--|--:
Mobile Services (incl. 5G) | 27.3%
Fixed-line (incl. VoIP, broadband, data comm.) | 19.5%
Media & Content | 10.1%
Financial Services (incl. credit card solutions) | 14.6%
Other (incl. IT, network services, real estate development) | 11.6%
Sale of goods (primarily mobile handsets) | 16.8%


Corporate Location Map:

https://i.imgur.com/syXIRxy.jpeg


KT has ~30% institutional ownership, with BlackRock being a large buyer in Q4 2020.  KT has also filed paperwork for a massive share repurchase program.  For what it‚Äôs worth in this day and age, the short % of shares outstanding is a measly 0.09%.  No one is going short on this thing at its current price.  You‚Äôd literally have to be insane to short it ‚Äì it‚Äôd be like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller.  


**FINANCIAL METRICS & PEER COMPARISONS**

KT‚Äôs balance sheet is rock solid.  While it may not have the booming high growth of clean tech or cannabis, it is still growing and maybe more importantly, doing so profitably.  I touched on the tangible book value in the TLDR above, but this cannot be understated.  If you were to liquidate the company entirely, shareholders would receive $20-30 per share after the debt had been repaid.  I have highlighted some comparison ratios in the images below to show the truly disgusting undervaluation of KT.  


Compared to US-based telecom services index peers:

https://i.imgur.com/iOmE5mI.jpeg


Using a comp multiple for valuation based on these index comps gives the following implied value per share for KT ranging from $26.33 - $109.88 (unrealistic top end):

https://i.imgur.com/0hYg7Zy.jpeg


Compared to industry peers/comps:

https://i.imgur.com/lT8uPvh.jpeg


The following comparison is really the tale of the tape.  When we look at tangible book value, we see that all of the peers are trading above the tangible book value.  This is obvious, given the share price should exceed the liquidation value.  But we see the opposite being true for KT.  Again, **it is trading at HALF of its tangible book value.**  You could theoretically buy up all of the existing shares, liquidate the company, and double your money.  This is what I mean by real **deep fucking value.**

https://i.imgur.com/vGaVp9b.jpeg


Not that we put much weight in them around here, but all of the analysts are bullish on KT as well, with median upside of 33%. 

https://i.imgur.com/Buhxpqq.jpeg


They just published their updated earnings presentation and have positive forecasts for growth as well:

I am long shares and 07/16/21 $15 calls.

Everyone looks for the **TLDR** at the bottom (I put it at the top of the post), but here it is:

Massively undervalued, $30/share realistic price target, it's trading at half of its tangible book value - meaning you could theoretically buy up all of the shares, liquidate the company's tangible assets, pay back the debt and be left with 2x your money and still have all of the intangible assets. This is REAL value.",2021-02-11 04:13:49

Publicly there is no break-out candidate but WKHS is one of three, but most likely one of two remaining companies to replace the USPS fleet (~165,000 vehicles). The other finalist, Oshkosh, is teaming up with Ford, but their submission is still an ICE which does NOT meet the request and intent of the president‚Äôs Zero-Emission initiative. Let‚Äôs pause and talk about Biden and the USPS for a second and I‚Äôll put it in bullet form so you morons skip to this part immediately:
    -Biden wants to electrify the entire US government fleet
    -Biden wants to the fleet to be 100% AMERICAN made vehicles
    -F is not 100% american made (something like only 64%, and even less for their future EV)
    -OSK/F‚Äôs submission is an ICE (they are planning EV but it was not their submission to the USPS contract bid)
    -WKHS is 100% manufactured in the USA
    -WKHS specializes in EV delivery vehicles and already has partnerships with all major delivery players
    -WKHS has patents and improvements to ‚Äòlast-mile‚Äô delivery

But even with all that info, some may still push for an OSK/F vehicle since they already have solid partnerships with the federal government. Let‚Äôs talk about that: OSK has a relationship with the military to make Humvee‚Äôs and other huge gas guzzling trucks for military purposes. But this relationship is with the federal govt and will not influence the USPS decision. The USPS is an independent agency under the executive branch of the government. Who is in charge of that branch? Exactly. (That is why Trump had so much influence over the last 4 years in the USPS and vote-by-mail, but not the time for this discussion). The USPS is also a for-profit agency AND RECEIVES NO DIRECT TAXPAYER FUNDING, but continues to operate at a loss. The USPS spent $706.2mm maintaining their fleet of shitty ICE clunkers in FY2019.

Short of Elon Musk going out and mailing his entire fortune in nickels to the ISS via First Class Mail, what better way to reduce cost and increasing revenue than by going completely EV. The USPS MUST reduce cost and improve technology chain to remain competitive:
    -ICE repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.028
    -EV repair and maintenance cost per mile ~$0.012
    -Total savings per vehicle for lifetime by using EV: ~$4600

The USPS is run by a board of governors who in turn elect a Postmaster General. They operate like any board of directors and must answer to deficits and losses. It is imperative for the USPS to remain up to date on emerging technologies to reduce cost of delivery. Which brings us to another point: Last Mile Delivery.

Last Mile Delivery accounts for more than 53% of total shipping cost. Last mile delivery is the distribution center to your doorstep (literally where USPS operates). It costs $10.10 to deliver a package to your door, but USPS is charging $8.08. So they are already operating a loss. Why is this so expensive?
1) Lower average speed + more time on the road = fewer mpg
2) More stops leads to more idling and more downtime
3) My neighborhood mailman always parks her truck at the bottom of the hill and hikes up ‚Äúto get exercise‚Äù = way more time for delivery


The first two of these issues are solved with WKHS. WKHS EV will reduce mpg cost (duh) but their final mile drone delivery and automated solutions will reduce the need for more stops and increase productivity chain. Seriously, look up the Workhorse Horsefly. The third issue I will not argue and fully support her getting in better shape.

With all this being said it‚Äôs obvious that I feel that WKHS is the obvious choice, but who knows what the board of governors is thinking. Below are the 4 scenarios for end game that a user came up with on tradingview but they are pretty standard:

Scenario One: 40% chance: WKHS earns the entire contract. Someone else did the math of the fair stock price after adjusting for the additional billions of dollars WKHS would have from winning the contract and they came out with $172 per share right after the contract was announced.

Scenario Two: 30% change: The contract is split up between Oskosh and WorkHorse. In the initial documentation before Biden's 100% green energy plans, the USPS wanted 75% electric 25% gas vehicles so it is possible workhorse gets 75% and Oskosh gets 25%. Others on the internet claim that it will be all or nothing but if you check the actual agreement it gives room for a split which the government does all the time. Even with only 10% of the contract awarded to WKHS you can expect to see the stock break past $60 the very next day.

Scenario Three: 20% chance: They can‚Äôt come to a decision and push it back until next quarter. This has happened already two times. They were first supposed to decide this summer, but they pushed it back to December. In December they failed again and pushed it back to latest March 31st. If this happens, the pullback to about $20 is super likely or at least holding the lower fibonacci retracement.

Scenario Four: 10% chance: OSK wins the contract. Oskosh is an awesome company, they have a very positive relationship with the government selling us Humvees for the military. They are respected and reliable, however they submitted a fossil fuel powered prototype and due to contract law can't just resubmit something else at the last minute. Especially with Biden wanting to look like he can get shit done AND after having made a statement about electrifying the US Fleet it looks insanely unlikely that OSK gets the entire bid, but if this happens, the only support that won't get destroyed the very next day is at the $16 level.

TLDR: WKHS should win the USPS contract and their short term viability relies on it.

My positions: 600 shares at $34 cost basis, $32C LEAPs 1/2022, $32C‚Äôs at 2/12, 2/19, 3/19
Total position is worth around 30,000 right now and about 40% of my single-registered.

Fidelity Investments Sold Its Entire Stake in GameStop. Time to realize it‚Äôs not WSB vs Wall St and move on with your life,0,lh1h9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lh1h9b/fidelity_investments_sold_its_entire_stake_in/,143,1613013915.0,"EDIT: for the idiots who cannot read and think Fidelity sold its position on December 31st, here is GAMESTOPS ownership report on Dec 31: https://news.gamestop.com/stock-information/institutional-ownership 

Fidelity owned 9.3 million shares as of dec 31. As of Jan 29, that number is 87. They unloaded their stake in January, stop downvoting everything that doesn‚Äôt conform to your hivemind.

Edit 2: Fidelity Investments = \ = Fidelity Mutual Funds, and as such they have different investment strategies. But I see that has escaped the galaxy brains on this post.  

Edit 3: People really coming thru and downvoting comments unrelated to gme because I posted a negative article about their messiah 

Edit 4: posting a link to an SEC file WHICH YOU CLEARLY DID NOT READ does not prove Fidelity did not sell. If you did a little actual thinking, you could go to the sec website and see that they in fact sell. Also the file you posted was not related to an internal transfer like you think. 

ORIGINAL POST: 
During January, Fidelity Investments sold its entire stake in GameStop, amounting to 9.3 million shares or 13% of the company, for massive gains. As of January 29, they now own 87 shares. Last I checked, Fidelity is no more a friend to you or me than Melvin Capital. 

It‚Äôs time to realize that this wasn‚Äôt wsb vs Wall st and move on with your lives. There was a massive short squeeze, with big money on either raise, and smart money cashed out at the top. Anyone who still has the stock isn‚Äôt ‚Äòholding the line‚Äô, just the bag. 

This sub turned into a cult. I want to see big plays and big ‚ÄòGuhs‚Äô, not a million posts about holding the line on a company that hasn‚Äôt turned a profit since 2018. This GME shit has ruined this sub, and I honestly think all these new users are going to be prime for pump and dump scams on random shit stocks, which really worries me in terms of this sub actually surviving. 

If you invested at the top in GME, I am sorry foe you and sorry that you got caught up in the mania. But some free advice: the second you get emotional about investing, you‚Äôve lost. If you invest more money than you can afford to lose, you‚Äôre not going to be able to think rationally or objectively about your investment, and will
Inevitably get plowed. Ditto for this fake crusade against Wall Street (which I‚Äôm convinced is cover for people to dump their shares on unsuspecting idiots).

**Fidelity Cashes In Most of GameStop Stake**

2/10/21, 1:07 PM
Fidelity Investments sold nearly all of its positions in GameStop Corp. last month, just as shares of the videogame retailer were surging.

Fidelity's GameStop stake dropped to 87 shares on Jan. 29 from 9.3 million shares, or 13% of the company, on Dec. 31, according to securities filings. The sales ended Fidelity's run as the volatile stock's largest shareholder.

I‚Äôm assuming this was on the 28th of Jan when RH ceased allowing buys. This would seem to be coordinate in a since that RH blocks the retail buyers and Fidelity pushes the shorts to cover at the lower...

TLDR: Uhh yeah...

Even worse is that the real answer to the thing they claim to want is staring them right in the face.
I'll explain 

    Fuck your shitdeology. Almost every post on GME is barely concealed garbage class warfare shit and is complete denialism almost entirely without any self awareness or actual real evidence. Or trash memes. (KINDA LIKE MOST OF THE STUFF ON THE REST OF REDDIT) What a shock! 

Save WSB please its been completely trashed for a month now. I remember when we would've been seeing dozens of posts about all the ERs going on. Instead its this garbage ideology shit masked as GME love. I made 100k off GME. Great. but if you think it was ever truly about beating hedgefunds you're seriously retarded. I only cared about hedgefunds involved because of the effect it had on the price and the early gamma squeeze that got it moving so rapidly. 

We've got 7 million people who don't know a goddamn thing about economics or finance and only care about those subjects now because they've tricked each other by Circle jerking about how this GME shit is somehow a revolution. 

If you care about that shit. (Which I dont) Then NO, GME isnt a revolution you fucking retards GME was just a single example about how decentralized access to the mechanisms of finance can create a new model for opportunity to ANYBODY regardless of origin that can elevate millions of peoples in this world's level of financial security and freedom.

 And that CAN happen. It can happen if.... if... IF you retards would stop being so self absorbed and in denial about GME and instead learn about the economics, the fundamentals, the financial institutions, instruments etc of how this shit works you could have your actual ""revolution"" your actual elevation of millions of people accessing ""rapid"" (but uneven) financial growth. 

Instead you just chant memes and pretend you're part of a cause by posting crap about HODL or whatever. You want to be long on GME? Hope the price falls to 20 or lower before earnings and YOLO that shit. (I will) But stop using blatant denialism to ruin a sub and financially ruin yourselves because you're literally just giving money to the hedgefunds that you claim to hate. If you care about poor people getting rich it doesnt require them beating ""the rich"". Melvin shitron shitadel, they're all just a massive drop in the bucket and killing them is just for your young egos it's not even a single bloodstain on the tapestry of wealth inequality or whatever shit you're worried about. Poor people getting rich ISNT reliant on rich people getting poor. Figure that out and you might actually go learn something and start making money. 


THIS ISNT A WAR.

THIS ISNT OCCUPY 2 OR MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE THAT SHIT WAS ALSO LEADERLESS, HOPELESSLY AMBIGUOUS, AND BEYOND POINTLESS.

Why Rite Aid is RAD not BAD (anymore),122,lgzdsg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgzdsg/why_rite_aid_is_rad_not_bad_anymore/,107,1613008570.0,"Welcome back to another Rite aid (RAD) shitpost.  I‚Äôm back as my prediction has been correct so far, and I only expect this trend to continue. Up 300% so far.  It is still incredibly EARLY for reasons I will explain.  



**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, your app is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you‚Äôre saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It‚Äôs okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  

In 2016 Rite Aid had 4561 stores with a stock price of 160~ (adjusted for split) and a market cap of 8 billion dollars.  

In 2020 Rite Aid has 2500 stores with a stock price of 25~ and a market cap of 1.5 billion.

Yet if we look here https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/RAD/rite-aid/revenue

Rite aid revenue has actually INCREASED over the past five years and is at 75% of its highest point.  


They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.


**MORE PROMISING NUMBERS**

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

Rite aid has a pretty optimistic balance sheet for a company that has been rebranding and restructuring.  Notably we can see they are sitting on 6 Billion in assets and are seeing 21 Billion Revenue with 12% growth this past quarter (over 25% this year)

Rite aid is becoming closer and closer to becoming consistently profitable once again as they are able to take advantage of coronavirus tax relief.  They are seeing increased foot traffic in their pharmacy and front end leading to this huge growth.  

Walgreens has 30x the market cap and 4x the revenue while CVS has 70x the market cap and 10x the revenue.  Neither are seeing the growth that rite aid is.  


**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on rite aid.  I am still holding shares and have adjusted my calls to 3-19 $30 and 4-16 $35 a handful of 2022 40$ as well.  

I have a price target or 50$ which I think is attainable by April. 

Tl;dr: Rite aid was shorted to shit and saved itself with a 1:20 reverse split.  As a result it‚Äôs STILL fundamentally undervalued.  Read last paragraph for plays.  

My earlier posts were earlier warnings but I‚Äôm yoloing today I think it‚Äôll start to run up again as vaccine distribution ramps up.",2021-02-11 01:56:10
Could Psychedelics (PSYK) be the next weed?,2581,lgz5jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgz5jz/could_psychedelics_psyk_be_the_next_weed/,1018,1613007977.0," 

Marijuana made so much money for those who got in very early. It was originally presented as a medical product, but when regions started to legalize it, it blew up.

Now there's a new ETF dealing in psychedelics (PSYK) that deals in a handful of companies focused on research for the application of psychedelics to treat mental health and other medical issues.

As mental health becomes an increasingly important part of medical research, and as countries around the world continue to lower regulation around the use of various 'narcotics' could this stock have the potential of blowing up?

I am thinking of investing, I just wanted to see what others think?",2021-02-11 01:46:17
Why APHA is an Alpha Trade in the Short and Long-run (Actual DD),671,lgz3x2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgz3x2/why_apha_is_an_alpha_trade_in_the_short_and/,274,1613007860.0,"Tl;dr: I'm willing to bet all of you degenerates smoke weed and drive to your wife's boyfriend's house every Saturday night. Then, the munchies kick in full force and you got to a Wendy's parking lot and jack off to a video of your wife flipping you off while riding a dong as least eight times longer than your 5 dollar inch long. There is a fucking bubble and you should get in. And it's a good long-term investment, so you should get in (none of this is financial advice, this is just me talking to myself in Reddit after taking anti-depressants from holding Gamestop).

&#x200B;

**Reason 1:** Everyone's a bull. The pigs and bears are dead because there's more money than what financial institutions know what to do with.

Remember SPY puts? Remember printer goes brrrrrr? Remember how monetary policy produced some of the greatest loss porn we've ever seen. Gay bears is kill and the government has proven that they will probably prop up the financial system even if bubonic plague 2.0 happens. That money is still floating around with the Fed's finger on the trigger prepared to smack the equity markets back up. That money was invested into stocks like TSLA (which is the most beautiful and terrifying bubble I've seen in my life). That money will also make weed stocks as high as a kite. Discounted cash flows, betas, stock/bond conflicts, and all that other stuff is irrelevant. Monetary policy is fundamental and will always save those who have money.

This is the new reality we live with. Like it or buy some guns, ammunition, and a lifetime worth of soylent and beyond meat and start your own 1 person country in the backass of nowhere.

There will be a bubble and it will pop. Do not be concerned about the pop until it appears imminent. And even if it does, I would still consider holding it for a delicious long play.

**Reason 2:** APHA's balance sheet is robust. Doesn't show any signs of collapsing financially. Longevity in a new industry is golden.

[https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/apha/financials)

Instead of getting high on their own supply when their stock soared as high as a kite, the comedown was harsh. But instead of getting rekt, they have been expanding rapidly regardless. Their sales have increased 142.34% in 2017, 80.62% in 2018, **542.28%** in 2019, and 128.73% in 2020. And considering that everyone's spending their stimulus money smoking weed and buying Gamestop, I do not see this trend stopping at any point. I've been to my local weed shop in CA and it's fucking packed every time I go in both pick ups and lines. I have to wait at least 45 minutes to get in.

Even though the net income is concerning (it usually is for companies that grow rapidly due to the costs of expanding like a chad), the firm has a really large pillow to fall on. To be clear, for a company to be totally dead in the water, its equity (the difference between its assets and liabilities) goes to zero. APHA has 2.5 billion in assets and .7125 mil in liabilities. This is perhaps one of the reasons it gobbled up Tilray-- APHA recognizes it can increase its market share in an inevitable market place. This means that the company can continue its rapid expansion without worrying about defaulting. For reference, Amazon could afford to lose hundreds of millions of dollars from 2012-2015 because it has the assets to afford rapid expansion. We are looking at a potential hundred billion dollar company here as the marijuana industry consolidates into a few major players. APHA is likely to be one of those, as it has the durability and fundamentals to survive years of consecutive negative net income. APHA's largest expenses are ""unusual expenses,"" implying that they are really swinging for the fences with many one-time expansive purchases. 

**Reason 3:** Because of BLM and a decade of rising sentiment against the war on drugs, enforcing weed possession and sales laws are politically dangerous.

Yup. Nixon's law and order paradigm is falling out of the sky. Busting into people's apartments for a gram of weed and sentencing the occupants to 9 years in prison is not too popular. Even if marijuana legalization doesn't happen this or next or whatever, the tide has overwhelming turned against a ""tough on crime"" attitude toward non-violent drug use. This means that across the United States (and likely the world over the next decade or so), **weed will be effectively legal** over time even if it's not truly legal.

Position: 40 shares of APHA high as a motherfucking kite.",2021-02-11 01:44:20

But many of you, esplecially the ones who got burned on GME, don't know which stock to gamble right now because many of them are already 100-200% up. My best advice for you right now is to go balls deep in Canopy Growth Corp (CGC). It's only 10% up since last week and still wasn't affected by WSB autists. [Yesterday they announced that their revenue is up 23% over the same quarter last year](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cannabis-giant-canopy-growth-surges-12-on-new-profitability-outlook-and-us-legalization-hopes-230939563.html) and their business looks very good and as soon as the legalization thing gets covered, CGC will skyrocket even without this hype so it's an actual long-term investment. And since everyone is buying weed stocks it's a much more attractive pick for you right now.

Amazon Doubles Down on Grocery,44,lgynbx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgynbx/amazon_doubles_down_on_grocery/,57,1613006673.0,"Amazon is aggressively investing in the retail grocery business with the goal of operating 2,000 retail stores in the US blended between Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh. And so far they are killing it!

There are currently 500 Whole Foods stores and 8 Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Over 30 Whole Foods and 27 Amazon Fresh stores are currently in development.

Amazon recently opened the doors to its newest Amazon Fresh in Northridge, California. While the store marks the banner‚Äôs third location in SoCal (joining [Woodland Hills](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/how-amazon-fresh-won-my-business) and [Irvine](https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/will-amazon-fresh-crush-it-california)), dozens of additional stores in various stages of development are also underway in the area. According to Planned Grocery, additional SoCal stores are planned or under construction in Poway, Whittier, Fullerton, Long Beach, La Verne and Encino. Additionally, four locations in the Chicago area are slated to open soon.

‚ÄúAmazon seems to be putting the pedal to the metal with its grocery expansion plans,‚Äù R-5 Capital Analyst Scott Mushkin wrote. ‚ÄúIn our view, it is hard not to see the recent partnership between Amazon and SpartanNash as a sign that Amazon intends to grow its store fleet rapidly over the next few years,‚Äù Mushkin said. According to the 2021 dunnhumby Retailer Preference Index, Amazon eclipsed top grocery retailers H-E-B and Trader Joe‚Äôs due to Speed, Digital and strong Price and Quality.

‚ÄúH-E-B and Trader Joe‚Äôs are terrific brands, yet Amazon‚Äôs unmatched convenience is addictive,‚Äù wrote Ms. Goller. ‚ÄúThe dunnhumby stats prove consumers crave prompt home delivery, a trend that will outlast the pandemic. Even when life resumes, Just Walk Out technology at Amazon Go and rivals‚Äô stores will set new brick-and-mortar standards for convenience, ease and time savings. Also, I expect Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh will continue to expand nationwide when the time is right. Amazon‚Äôs hungry to win and its grocery party is just getting started.‚Äù

During United Natural Foods' recent earnings call, CEO Steven Spinner expects to renew its Whole Foods contract in early 2021. From their recent 10K filling, ""We have been the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market for more than twenty years. Under the terms of our agreement with Whole Foods Market, we serve as the primary distributor to Whole Foods Market in all of its regions in the United States. Our agreement with Whole Foods Market expires on September 28, 2025. Whole Foods Market is our only customer that represented more than 10% of total net sales in fiscal 2020."" Whole Foods accounted for approximately 18% of UNFI's net sales in fiscal 2020.

During Amazon's recent earnings call, Dave Fildes, director of¬†investor relations, said the Amazon Go Grocery format was ‚Äúoff to a good start,‚Äù adding there was ‚Äúa lot of interest‚Äù in the technology behind it and Amazon Fresh grocery stores.

Given the investments Amazon has made in the grocery business and the significant positive response thus far favorably positions Amazon and other grocery suppliers such as United Natural Foods (UNFI).

Virgin Galactic $SPCE,265,lgxvh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgxvh9/virgin_galactic_spce/,115,1613004708.0,"Dear /Wallstreetbets

&#x200B;

Today I want to talk about Virgin Galactic and the potential the company has. Space travel is vastly developing and together with the EV business this will be the future.

**Chamath** helped Virgin Galactic in the process to go public. Recently Cathie announced that she will create **a Space ETF**. ARKQ has been buying a lot of shares over the last few months. Recently ARKQ sold some shares, but I would consider it normal since the stock is up by 140% since September. I would assume ARKQ took some profits and reinvested them in other companies.

I would like to take a look at the business model of the company. Many ""Bears"" are saying that the business won't be profitable because of the high cost of the tickets. Estimates are that the price for one ticket will be around 250.000 dollars. So their customers would have to be millionaires in order to be able to pay for it. Only 1% of the population is a millionaire. So you would assume it won't be very profitable in the long run.

But let's take a look at the history of flying. In it's early years, flying was very expensive and only a luxury for the rich. Back in 1941, the cost to travel from Boston to Los Angeles was **$4539.24**. In 2015 this only costs **$480.89**. Source: [https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/history-of-flight-costs](https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/history-of-flight-costs)

Space travel might have a similar trend regarding the price of the tickets. Only the rich will be able to afford a ticket to space in the beginning but as technology improves, the business costs will be reduced.

But space travel is not their only catalyst. They are looking into supersonic flights. They made a deal with **Rolls-Royce** regarding this subject. Here's an article for those who are interested: [https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/](https://www.virgingalactic.com/articles/virgin-galactic-unveils-mach-3-aircraft-design-for-high-speed-travel-and-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-rolls-royce/)

I want to talk about the short interest. **The short percent of float is currently 71.95%**! In November the short percent reached its peak at 89.3%. Since then some shorts have been covering their positions as many catalysts are being released. But with a successful flight to space, the stock price might surge and more shorts might give up on their position. I just want to point you out, the stock price in November was $26.61. Currently the stock trades at $56.71. To be honest, they might be sweating right now. Source: [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SPCE/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/SPCE/short-interest/)

Okay I will finish this DD with a list of **catalysts** which are coming:

\- This **Saturday** Virgin galactic will open the **flight window**. This does not mean they will fly the Saturday, but it will happen within the next few days. There was an unsuccessful flight back in December. But what some people might not understand, is the amount of safety procedures a company has to take. SpaceX for example are shooting up many rockets each year, but there are no passengers. So when a rocket explodes, many people would be fascinated by the explosion. But imagine if a rocket with 3 people exploded. That's why it is so much harder for Virgin Galactic to have a successful flight.

I live in Belgium and I was watching the news here. Back in December the news reported about the failed flight of Virgin Galactic. I didn't expect this at all. But imagine if they have a successful flight. The news would spread around the world.

\- After the successful flight, Richard Branson will go to space later this year. It was scheduled in Q1-Q2 of 2021, but it got pushed back due to the failed test in december.

\- They are expecting to have their first commercial space flight in 2021.

\- Cathie will launch her Space ETF.

I think this stock has a lot of potential and a successful flight will launch this stock. Virgin Galactic will literally bring us closer to the moon. I hope you enjoyed my DD and if i missed something, please let me know in the comments.",2021-02-11 00:51:48

$AUY is a Gold Mine (Both Figuratively and Literally),106,lgxwrq,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgxwrq/auy_is_a_gold_mine_both_figuratively_and_literally/,105,1613004806.0,"Hello Fellow Retards,

I come to you with news from a boomers favorite form of currency: gold. More specifically, a mining company, Yamana Gold. They have earnings tomorrow on the 11th, and based on their previous guidance, they are going to post very strong earnings. Although I hold shares (yeah yeah I know), options are dirt cheap with such low IV. I want to present a case for the company as I believe they have a great year ahead of them.

Now I know gold is down in the past few months, but it still remains as strong as its ever been, and Yamana Gold (ticker $AUY) has been absolutely benefiting from the high prices. With the Feds keeping lending rates low through 2023 and supporting this vision with monthly Treasury bond purchases, this can push down long-term yields. Add this onto the ongoing fiscal stimulus and a steadily increasing money supply, there are many reasons for investors to choose gold in the coming years.

On top of high gold/silver prices, Yamana is looking at a nice increase in production from their Canadian Malartic mine in 2021, and is expected to benefit from higher output at the newer Cerro Moro mine. Yamana is pushing to deeper underground levels at Cerro Moro, which will lead to improved yield and production potential. Yamana's management expects to [produce at least 1 million gold equivalent ounces](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/02/3-value-stocks-thatll-make-you-richer-in-february/) (GEO) in each of the next three years.¬†

With gold prices up significantly over the past five years, Yamana has also been able to [reduce its net debt](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/07/29/should-you-buy-gold-stocks-right-now.aspx) by over $1 billion, and increase their annual dividend 425% over 18 months. In a few more quarters at this 1 million GEO annual target, and it just might become net-cash positive.

DD: Cinemark ($CNK) ‚Äì Clear Standout in ‚ÄúMoon Stock‚Äù ScreenüöÄüöÄüöÄ,78,lgy6fl,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgy6fl/dd_cinemark_cnk_clear_standout_in_moon_stock/,51,1613005473.0,"First time poster, longtime tard. GME was too beautiful to remain a passive reader. Sure, lob your ‚ÄúHF shill‚Äù comments (bring it retards) but then hear me out if you like $$$$ (‚Ä¶can‚Äôt be sure with half you guys‚Ä¶)

The perfect stock has been right in front of your eyes and it‚Äôs so obvious it hurts. AMC‚Äôs ugly sister, CNK, is strapped to an Elon Musk rocket and is just begging for someone to press the big shiny launch button.

This is a rare one-two punch where both the technical & fundamental pictures look great.

**Punchline Upfront:** CNK currently trades at $20. CNK has upside to $40. These are levels at which it traded only 18 months ago. In fact, CNK traded in a $10 range between $32 and $42 in 2019 with an average price of $37.80¬†

# Technical: The Ice Cream (The Tendie?)

OK‚Ä¶ Why CNK? Simple: I ran a ‚ÄúMoon Screen‚Äù which looked for:¬†

1. **High Short Interest** (>20% of floatable shares outstanding)
2. **Cheap Stock** (Hasn‚Äôt Had A ‚ÄúGME moment‚Äù, low 1 year return, fundamentals etc.)
3. **Small company** with lower trading volume (both mean more upside)
4. **Liquid** (i.e. a lot) **call options** (fuck puts) to minimize trading costs (i.e. maximize tendies)¬†

and CNK got spit out as the clear standout. If this feels familiar, it‚Äôs because most of these criteria were based off GME before Cohen was announced to the board. That‚Äôs right: I simply want to acknowledge the salivating technical set up and it‚Äôs similarity to GME pre-orbit.¬†

# Fundamental: The Cherry on Top (The Tendie Sauce?)

COVID has changed the world in lasting, meaningful ways and CNK‚Äôs theatre footprint is uniquely positioned to benefit from these changes. Pent-up demand for out-of-home entertainment combined with a backlog of strong film content creates a strong backdrop for Cinemark.

&#x200B;

# Reason 1: Suburban + Lower-Income Tilt Will Outperform in Post-COVID World

* TL;DR: Suburban Footprint = Actually Really Fucking Good (For Many Reasons)

Cinemark‚Äôs theatre footprint is slated toward suburban locations. Don‚Äôt take my word for it, here is their COO/CFO Sean Gamble (really his name lol): ‚Äú\[CNK\] tends to be more suburban, while \[AMC‚Äôs\] circuit tends to be a bit more metro.‚Äù **This is what gets me excited.** While we still don‚Äôt fully know the extent COVID had on people living in dense, urban areas like NYC, the preliminary read is that it has accelerated the move to the suburbs. This helps CNK for two reasons:

1. Suburban locations have lower rent
2. Suburban locations stand to benefit from higher demand based off people moving to the suburbs

Just think for a second. On average, suburbs have less fun shit to do. Although going to the movies might not sound that exciting in a city given all the great alternatives, going to the movies might be ‚Äúthe only game in town‚Äù in suburbia

In addition, Cinemark operates primarily in smaller cities and suburban areas, meaning lower-income where customers are more price-sensitive. Cinemark‚Äôs customer base also has a higher share of families than AMC/Regal. This also helps CNK:

1. More price sensitive customers => less ability to create a compelling movie experience at home => more likely to continue going to the theater

# Reason 2: Better Balance Sheet => Longer Runway to Weather ‚ÄúCOVID Storm‚Äù

* TL;DR: Lots Money + Low Debt + Low Rent = I Can Wait Out COVID

Strong balance sheet (850mm in cash sitting there; low leverage of 2x-3x vs. AMC at 8.5x).¬†

Industry-leading Operations with FAT margins (23-26% domestic margins; 8.6% ‚Äúfatter‚Äù (i.e. good, fat margin = fat tendie) than AMC)

Low rent obligations. New/updated theaters. Nice operational runway to weather the COVID storm.

# Reason 3: Boost From Dollar Weakness

25% of revs from Latin America. Huge FX headwind here if dollar depreciates (which many people think)¬†

&#x200B;

**Valuation/\*Nerd Shit\*:**

* Has traded historically at 6.5-8.5x fwd EBITDA. Conservatively, take low end of range due to sentiment around streaming killing box office sales despite still trading at 8.5x as recently as a few years ago¬†
* Full-year 2021 revs will be -50% but by 2022, revs should be back to 2019 (pre-COVID) levels. So, using 2022 lvls is the right forward base to value this thing.
* EBITDA was \~750mm in 2019. 50mm haircut for potential covid hiccups puts me at¬†700mm estimate for 2022 (again, the first ‚Äúnormal‚Äù year given 2021 is already off to shit start). Taking the low-end of the valuation multiple, 6.5x, gives me a price of $38.50 (after dividing by shares outstanding)

**Target Price: $38.50**

&#x200B;

**Afterthought ‚Äì Takeout Upside:**

* Streaming service (AMZN, NFLX, DIS) bundling subscriptions with theatre access might serve as a competitive differentiator as the content wars get increasingly competitive as nearly a dozen streaming services compete for market share. Might snatching up a cinema on the cheap offer an edge via a differentiated experience tack on?
* Just as restaurants won‚Äôt go away despite everyone having a kitchen, theatres could still have a role, although a changed one that will have to become experience-first, movie-second
* As long as dates (esp. highschool !) and nights out still happen, having an extra avenue to watch movies besides your couch will still have some demand
* A physical footprint for AMZN to test VR and reinforce other e-commerce services

Not calling for a DD. I say buy in for the short term (Calls) to capitalize on the uptrend to ER, then get out, and determine what you want to do next by the Lockup

&#x200B;

The drop hurts, I know. But understand that this dip is in reality, another buying opportunity that was initiated by a few things.

Firstly the most obvious one, the NASDAQ. It's plunging right now; down, -0.6 atm although it's slowly recuperating it's #'s; good job Sleepy Joe. Since the WSB hype left us during the initial blitz, we now follow the MKT beat for beat. So yeah, I wonder what would happen.

Secondly, you have to consider why people might consider selling. Although we can scream ""to the moon"" all day, in the short term, you'd have to acknowledge how much PLTR has jumped since the Thursday scare, even with the price tanking. Before the SOD, it was at $38, nearly a 20% jump up from 5 days ago. And even with the drop, we're in a very strong, Bullish uptrend. On top of that, we've had 5 ascending closes in a row, differed by pretty big figures, it can't keep doing this for forever. So although as a Long, the reasoning is beyond short sighted and retarded for literally a million reasons, you can at least see where they're at in the head.

Plus don't forget, we're still a top tier MM target and you know deep down they're licking their lips for ER. On top of that, don't forget about all the Retail Traders who are doing so also, but haven't cashed in. It's only Wednesday. ER is Pre-MKT Tuesday. That's a whole week to go through. Wdyt think is going to happen when people realize the beast that's soon to come as everyday passes? You believe we'll be below $30 EOW, with the inevitable hype, like those vegetable brained Bears keep preaching?

Hovering around $36 really isn't that bad, it's just back to where we were 2 days ago, that's still huge progress for a week's time. Longs, remain plush. Late bloomers, don't fret. The upward jump will recrudesce once more, back to tranquility lane.

So as we've all said before. Just hold on tight, buy up those dips and enjoy the ride as the blitz has yet to commence. This is just a minor Pullback, a road bump, in a drive up the mountain.",2021-02-11 00:07:35
Teva Pharma,71,lgwpyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgwpyx/teva_pharma/,73,1613001641.0,"Well, If anyone listened to my last post about ACB and bought some OTM FDs you'd be up a cool 500% if you sold this morning, so figured give this another shot.  

With 2.1billion in positive cash flow Teva has committed to making these changes by 2030 

Specifically, the company has committed by 2030 to:

* Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33% versus 2017 levels to support efforts to limit the global temperature increase to well below 2¬∞C, aligning with the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement.
* Improve transparency of Scope 3 GHG emissions and increase engagement on climate issues with key suppliers throughout the value chain.
* Increase energy efficiency by 10% and the total proportion of energy purchased or generated from renewable sources to 50%.
* Reduce total water withdrawal by 10% in areas projected to be in water stress.
* Assess and mitigate the environmental impact of pharmaceutical ingredients used in operations.
* Reduce the overall mass of secondary and tertiary packaging materials per unit dose and increase the proportion of recycled and responsibly-sourced materials by 10%.
* Assess the environmental lifecycle impact of key products.
* Continue to minimize waste generated from operations and the environmental impact of its disposal.
* Meet existing AMR Industry Alliance commitments to minimize antimicrobial discharges from the supply chain.¬†  

That sounds pretty fuckin green, aka one stock to own during the Biden presidency.

&#x200B;

Also lets look at some projections for next year

 2021 business outlook:

* Revenues are expected to be $16.4 - $16.8 billion (2020 actual results include \~$240 million in revenues from generic products in Japan divested on February 1, 2021, along with a manufacturing site)
* Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be $2.50 - $2.70
* Free cash flow is expected to be $2.0 - $2.3 billion

Someone wanna explain to me how a company projected to do 16 Billion plus in revenue still only have a market cap of 12 billion? Simple it's underpriced.

No. To ensure we have a fair system, we don‚Äôt take rebates into consideration when we choose which market maker will execute your orders. Also, all market makers with whom we have relationships pay us rebates at the same rate.

Ford Motors (F) DD,212,lgvkn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgvkn4/ford_motors_f_dd/,172,1612998497.0,"**Overview**

Ford Motors is currently undervalued ($45B) after an underperforming Q4 but is taking the right steps to compete in the electric and autonomous vehicle markets going forward.

**Reasons**

* Ford is already in an upward trend the past 30 days. This week they just released news of their **$29 Billion** (with a 'B') investment into their electric and autonomous vehicles department  ([link](https://www.motortrend.com/news/ford-ev-investment-2025/)) surpassing that of General Motors.
* Ford now has it's first credible mass-market competition to Tesla in the [2021 Mustang Mach-E electric crossover SUV](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/mustang-mach-e/) which goes on sale later this year.
* Ford is bringing the real 'merica to electric trucks (sorry Elon) with it's upcoming [F-150 full-size truck](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/ford/f-150/2021/2021-ford-f-150-first-look-review/) in mid-2022.
* Rivian, backed by Ford and Amazon, looking to IPO this year ([link](https://www.chicagobusiness.com/manufacturing/rivian-backed-amazon-and-ford-aims-ipo-year))
* Ford in the running to be Post Office's next delivery vehicle ([link](https://fordauthority.com/2020/12/ford-transit-in-running-to-become-post-offices-next-delivery-vehicle/))
* The **new Ford Bronco release date** is spring 2021. ([link](https://www.ford.com/bronco/))
* Tesla is in trouble with Chinese regulators and other companies are ready to take up some market share.
* Even if you don't buy options and are just a share investor, Ford Motors has a respectable 1.30 Dividend Yield.
* And if you don't believe me an actual (non-monkey) analyst has already said it would be going up to $14 ([link](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ford-upgraded-to-buy-at-argus-with-a-price-target-that-matches-the-street-high-2021-02-09)).

**Speculation**

With Tesla leading the market in electric vehicles, America needs competition to take place. Who better than one of the oldest vehicle manufacturers? Ford knows trucks, which will be a big part of the upcoming electric market. How many times have you heard two bro's start arguing about trucks and inevitably one of them is always a Ford?!? The stock is ripe for the taking and if you want to get some tendies, you should get in now.

**TLDR**; Ford is 'merica. 'Merica needs electric trucks. Go buy Ford.

APHA vs TLRY Arbitrage,1199,lgw1aa,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgw1aa/apha_vs_tlry_arbitrage/,560,1612999739.0,"* TLRY and APHA are merging.
* 1 Share of TLRY is bouncing around 60/share at the moment.
* 1 Share of APHA is about 28/share

When the merger completes the publicly announced ratio of the new company to the old is that current Tilray stockholders will retain exactly one share, while due to market cap+outstanding shares at the time of the merger, APHA shareholders will retain .83 shares per current share of APHA.

So, if current prices hold there is a HUGE gap here that must close. Either TLRY must come down, or APHA must rise. Based on current value of TLRY, APHA shares have an expected value of 49.8

Based on the current value of APHA, TLRY shares have an expected value of 33.5ish

OR, if for some reason the gap stays as large as it is, APHA shareholders will realize a 78% gain at the moment of the merger.

Positions:

APHA 35c Feb 12

APHA Shares

EDIT: Some of you are a little dense.  To be clear, if the results here are

1. TLRY falls to close gap
2. APHA Rises to close gap
3. APHA shareholders realize a large gain in value at time of merger.
4. TLRY RISES more than APHA 

The obvious play would be APHA. In all three situations you are either neutral or gaining.

EDIT2: There ARE, of course, other situations in which you get boned here.  For example, the merger could fall through, TLRY could drop like a stone, BOTH could drop, etc. ",2021-02-10 23:28:59

A thread on pfizer,40,lgtdtj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgtdtj/a_thread_on_pfizer/,99,1612991680.0," 

The consensus here and in the market is that all the money to be made on Pfizer has been made. I disagree for a few reasons and am currently pumping money into this stock as much as I can. Before reading this, I want to state as clearly as possible I am not in any way a professional/financial advisor I am a 20-year-old mechanical engineering student the only proper education in this area is from yale open-source courses and from books like stocks for the long runs. I believe Pfizer will bottom out at a worst-case scenario of 32$ if I see 32$ I will yolo my portfolio into 3-month 40$ calls, but what I am hoping for is it does not recover until the next quarterly report in which case I will yolo my portfolio into five day or single day calls. Again, I cannot stress enough I am not a professional please do you own research before following me and also if u see a flaw in my theory please tell me. I also want to state that Pfizer has a market cap of 200 billion we do not have the buying power to in any way pump that I am not trying to generate hype around this, but it is 50% of my portfolio.

1 investing fundamentals. 

One of the most important ratios in investing is the price to earnings ratio. This fundamentally indicates if a stock is over or undervalued. In the book stocks for the long run which is high on yales economics reading list the author states that a p/e ratio of 16 or higher is overvalued currently the market average is 27 indicating a stock market crash is coming however Pfizer‚Äôs is currently twelve. As a dividend stock which it historically has been it would be undervalued based on pure economic theory. To give some examples of competitors p/e ratio Johnson Johnson=26 AstraZeneca= 26 moderna is not profitable. My point here is that Pfizer has one of the best prices to earnings ratio of any company on the market right now indicating it is undervalued. This also indicates in the event of a market crash Pfizer will be one of the best stocks to be holding.

2 currently in a large dip that Pfizer always recover well from

The Pfizer share price has tanked in the last few weeks as wall street decided that spending 2-3 billion developing  the COVID-19 vaccine to save the world was too much money to spend (typical fucking scum of wall street). As a historically consistent  dividend paying stock Pfizer is a well-liked stock by hedge funds and pensions these funds do not reward bad quarters and pulled out this has caused the price to dip over 10%. In the last few years this happened before in July Pfizer announced that it was planning on changing its business model all these funds pulled out and the share price dropped 8 dollars, from this and the fact that it is fundamentally undervalued I believe it wont drop more than 8 dollars. 

3 the vaccine revenue will actually take Pfizer to the moon. 

For all these hedge funds focusing on dividend stocks quarterly profit is all they care about Pfizer spent large and didn‚Äôt earn extra last quarter Pfizer is expecting at least 15 billion dollars in profit from the vaccine alone, when you add this to their typical earnings that is 65 billion expected earnings a 30% increase on their usual earnings , they will absolutely smash their last quarter performance, all the investing into the vaccine has been done now it is time for them to cash in. on top of this Pfizer has massively cut expenditure by splitting the company into two Pfizer and viatrus (I will address this at the end)

4 AstraZeneca vaccine might not work.

It does not work on the Brazilian or south African strain. 

5 professional opinions 

Every market pundit I can find is estimating that the share price hits 42 dollars this year, some estimating up to 69(nice) while I don‚Äôt always trust sources such as CNN money or market commentators in general what It is to me is a validation of my estimations and research. 

6 change in direction to become a growth company.

Last year Pfizer announced they were changing their business model from a revenue to growth company meaning they offloaded essentially all non-patented drugs which provided consistent but low revenue this allows them to focus on developing new highly profitable drugs such as the COVID-19\_\_\_0 vaccine while these have high start-up costs of 2-3 billion Pfizer is worth 200 billion and can easily ride out the volatility of 1/5 investments not working when for example the Pfizer vaccine will net them 15 billion minimum (could be more if AstraZeneca fail) that is not all the investment will makes the miRNA technology means they can make a new vaccine in 2 months if needed, this technology will be ridiculously profitable. Typically, investors buy into companies with a growth business plan at wildly overvalued prices e.g., tesla p/e is 1700 because the prospect of future growth outweighs the lack of current earnings Pfizer is a company aiming for huge growth who are also one of the most fundamentally undervalued stonks on the market. 

Conclusion 

Pfizer share price is wildly undervalued the market will not take long to correct this when it bounces back it might rocket to the moon and I am strapped in for that moment but even if it doesn‚Äôt it will get a 15% gain; I believe that the dip is turning now . my plan is to do this. 

A hold the shares I have buy 3 month calls with 40% of my remaining portfolio.

B if I see 34 dollars put 10% of my remaining portfolio 3-month calls. 

C if I see 33 dollars put 30% of my remaining portfolio in 3-month calls. 

D if I then see 32 dollars yolo my life‚Äôs savings (10 times my portfolio) In 3-month calls. 

E if the share price is still below 40 dollars coming up to the next quarterly report, I will yolo in 5-day calls aiming for a 2 dollar gain per share (Pfizer has a huge market cap it will move slowly)

This is my opinion on Pfizer I am not in any way qualified to give financial advice  for honesty I am saying I have a position I Pfizer, but I do not believe it is conceivably possible for us to adjust the share price of a 200b dollar company . Please if I have missed something let me know before I yolo on this am I just retard",2021-02-10 21:14:40

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/10/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-10-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to bounce after breaking a six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average indicated up nearly 100 points. A late fade Tuesday resulted in the Dow and S&P 500 falling slightly from closing record highs and breaking six-session winning streaks. However, the Nasdaq managed to hold on to a modest advance and notching another record close.

> * On the economy, the government releases its look at January consumer prices at 8:30 a.m. ET, one hour before the opening bell on Wall Street. At 2 p.m. ET, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at an Economic Club of New York webinar, in an address focusing on the state of the American job market.

*****

> # 2. Coca-Cola, GM report better-than-expected Q4

> * Coca-Cola on Wednesday said the coronavirus pandemic is still hurting sales, but cost-cutting efforts helped it top analyst earnings estimates. Shares of the Dow component rose 2% in premarket trading. The beverage giant made 47 cents per share in the fourth-quarter. Net sales dropped 5% to $8.6 billion, missing expectations. Unit case volume, which strips out the impact of foreign currency, shrank by 3%. All four of its beverage segments reported volume declines.

> * Shares of General Motors fell more than 1% in the premarket after the U.S. automaker said Wednesday that a global semiconductor chip shortage could cut earnings by $1.5 billion and $2 billion this year. GM‚Äôs crosstown rival, Ford, last week said the chip shortage could lower its earnings. GM also issued fourth-quarter profit of $1.93 per share on revenue of $37.5 billion. Both beat analyst expectations.

*****

> # 3. Twitter is ‚Äòbigger than any one account,‚Äô CEO says

> * Shares of Twitter rose more than 5.5% in Wednesday‚Äôs premarket, the morning after the social media network reported fourth-quarter earnings of 38 cents per share on revenue of $1.29 billion, both of which beat estimates. Monetizable daily active users gained 30% to 192 million from a year ago, but still fell short of expectations. Twitter is ‚Äúbigger than any one account,‚Äù said CEO Jack Dorsey, in his first earnings call following the ban of then-President Donald Trump last month, days after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.

*****

> # 4. Trump impeachment trial continues with opening arguments

> * Opening arguments are set begin at noon ET Wednesday in Trump‚Äôs second impeachment trial. An emotional first day ended with the Senate voting to hear the case on whether to convict the former president of inciting the Capitol riot even though he‚Äôs no longer in office. Watching the proceedings from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, Trump was furious at what he saw from his attorneys Tuesday, according to a person familiar with his thinking. The 50-50 split Senate is expected to acquit Trump.

*****

> # 5. Covid spike in the U.S. show signs of slowing

> * The crushing coronavirus spike in the U.S. has been showing signs of abating, with 95,360 new cases Tuesday less than a third of the record high new daily infections of 300,282 on Jan. 2. The number of people in U.S. hospitals being treated for Covid-19 totaled 79,179 on Tuesday, the first daily count below 80,000 since Nov. 18. U.S. deaths from the virus averaged 2,857 over the past seven days. Fatalities reached a single-day peak of 4,432 on Jan. 12.

1) BB has nothing to do with smartphones. Throw those 2007 notions out of your mind and bring yourself to the future

2) Whilst the whole stock market has been pissing themselves for years over EV/AV industry speculation, the reality is that these are hardware companies with low margin, and limited scale potential.

Even Tesla, owned and run by the richest man in the world, has yet to build more than 500,000 cars in one year. Meanwhile Tesla competitors springing up everywhere with both new challengers such as NIO and old money fucks getting into EV such as VW and GM (GM in December 2020 announced 100% by 2030 all cars would be 100% EV).

THE REAL FUCKING MONEY is not in EV production which has low margin and low scale, but in data monetization which is high margin (and being software) has unlimited scale. In the same way that Google makes only $18Bn revenue from hardware sales (phone, nest sales etc) but makes $120Bn from data monetization, $BB is going to to the fucking moon with $200BN revenue + by 2030 with 10% net whilst Tesla and other big auto are fighting over 4% margins (Tesla net profit in 2020 = 4% whilst **BB sat at a juicy 10.15%**).

This industry is going to the fucking moon, and BB is the only one with a front row ticket üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ. This shit is like investing in Google or Amazon in the year 2000, by the time the mainstream saw the potential 5 years later, shit was already at pluto

u/just an everyday life couldn't have put it better: ""Zombie cars and QNX

QNX is the first commercial microkernel RTOS. What the fuck does that even mean nerd? For anyone like me who's not a software genius, I've done some research so we all know what we're getting into. A Real Time Operating System is developed to focus processing power on two most important things: Speed and Accuracy. This is different from shit like Windows and Mac OS (General Purpose OS or GPOS) as they spread processing power throughout the system because there isn't exactly anything that's significantly more important than the others. However, when you're using a self-driving program you need the hardware to perform the action at the exact time and speed. Your self driving program brakes too late? Crash into the car ahead of you. Your self program turns the wheel too late or too soon? Crash into a wall.

Blackberry has been working on this technology since 2014. But car makers literally couldn't develop autonomous vehicles fast enough. So these guys have just been twiddling their fucking thumbs.

Fast forward to now, where the rise of Tesla has made everyone and their momma make a self driving EV. Everyone is trying to make their own autopilot program but not their own OS. So who's OS are they using?

SONY? Blackberry QNX. Baidu? QNX baby. XPENG? Blackberry as well. If you read the article, you'll see XPEV is using DESAY's autopilot program that's built on QNX. Know who else is using DESAY autopilot? Li Auto But what about Nio you might ask? Well on NIO day, it was announced that NIO will be using Nvidia DRIVE....which is also built on QNX. What about the Apple car? There's no confirmation yet, but rumors of them reaching out to both Canoo and Hyundai makes me skeptical that Apple has succeeded in creating their own RTOS even after rumors of them starting 7 years ago. But even if they did... it doesn't even matter.

BB is a growth company in a growth industry, these hedge funds are going to need to borrow more money if they want to buy tendies after the wider market realizes the market inefficiency that is an undervalued BB. u/Tradergurue went into a lot of detail in his $BB short interest post here [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short\_interest\_in\_bb\_its\_increasing/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8pg8x/short_interest_in_bb_its_increasing/)

Cresco Labs ($CRLBF) - Why I like this weed stock,259,lgs5q7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgs5q7/cresco_labs_crlbf_why_i_like_this_weed_stock/,152,1612987161.0,"TL:DR at the bottom. Not financial advice.

With weed stocks gaining momentum, I thought I share one which I believe is undervalued vs other key players. Cresco currently operates in 9 US states.

This analysis will focus on what I believe are the three most important factors for cannabis - Revenue, Revenue Growth, Liquidity.

***Revenue - Cresco vs 5 key players***

- Cresco Labs: 355M Revenue ; Market Cap 3.5B
- Canopy Growth: 477M Revenue ; Market Cap 18.3B
- Curaleaf: 472M Revenue ; Market Cap 11.6B
- Cronos: 37M Revenue ; Market Cap 4.8B
- Tilray*: 201M Revenue ; Market Cap 6.7B
- Aurora: 273M Revenue ; Market Cap 3.1B
- Aphria+Tilray: 803M Revenue ; Market Cap 20B

If we look purely at revenue, only Aurora and Aphria/Tilray merger appears to have a similar market pricing to Cresco, with a Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 11 and 13 respectively vs Mkt Cap/Revenue ratio of 10 for Cresco. The 4 other stocks vary from a ratio of 24 to 133.

This means purely on revenue, Cresco could be considered to be undervalued vs other key weed stocks.

***Revenue Growth TTM vs 2019 - Vs 5 key players***

- Cresco Labs: 175% Growth
- Canopy Growth: 111% Growth
- Curaleaf: 114% Growth
- Cronos: 54% Growth
- Tilray*: 20% Growth
- Aurora: 10% Growth
- Aphria+Tilray: 99% Growth

Cresco has by far the highest revenue growth ratio. And this is just looking at ttm vs 2019 as Cresco have their 2020 fiscal calendar report in April. This means on top of these figures, some of these companies would have had more time to grow revenue vs their fiscal calendar 2019 due to differing fiscal calendars.

***Liquidity***

Below I'm only looking at current ratio and quick ratio. The higher the ratio, the better.

- Cresco Labs: 1.06 / 0.53
- Canopy Growth: 6.09 / 5.16
- Curaleaf: 1.42 / 0.64
- Cronos: 4.73 / 4.62
- Tilray*: 2.82 / 1.86
- Aurora: 1.54 / 0.97
- Aphria+Tilray: 4.44 / 3.09

Cresco has a lower market cap as it is a possibility it does go bankrupt this year if things turn for the worse. However Cresco has a positive EBITDA in their last earnings report and if it does get an injection of cash/stronger results than expected, there is massive room to grow to reach the same value as other companies in the same category.

One of the things that is holding it back is that you can only trade the stock on OTC markets or the Canadian exchange. If it does enter a major US exchange, I can see it go big.

Just like every other weed stock, this stock has growth plans with new dispensaries in yada yada, will have better productivity due to yada yada, increases cultivation by xxx% in yada yada due to yada yada space, and has a new Chief Commercial Officer who has great experience in CG in companies such as yada, yada yada, and yabbadabbadoo. Do your own research, all weed stocks have something new and exciting like this one.

Trades as $CRLBF or CAD$CL.CN. I have 120 shares.

TL:DR: Dude weed lmao

The best way to solve this would be for someone to set up a new sub, something like ‚ÄúGMEBETS‚Äù whatever and then the influx of only GME posters can migrate there.

Compass Pathways [$CMPS] - Trusting Peter Thiel With My Psychedelics Bet,253,lgr4yj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgr4yj/compass_pathways_cmps_trusting_peter_thiel_with/,132,1612982739.0,"Hello fellow degenerate gamblers,

Kimchi here... back with another DD to make you all some tendies. My last posted DD was all about headphones... ended up being a nice 5-bagger *with stocks*. I'm here today to tell you about Compass Pathways \[$CMPS\], a company I think will be my next multi-bagger trade.

***Psychedelics:***

Why psychedelics? Psychedelic (and $CMPS in particular) companies tend to focus on the medical aspect of shroom use, looking to create medications to **treat illnesses that are traditionally underserviced**. Compass, for example, focuses on treatment resistant depression - essentially depression that hasn't been able to be treated by medication, counseling, etc. Depression rates have been rising for years and CMPS and other psychedelic drug makers look to **target those most affected**.

[Depression rates increasing](https://preview.redd.it/bygysv8wcmg61.png?width=1100&format=png&auto=webp&s=3392bcff460f4e60e1d30201a20b4977fac5fc9a)

Psychedelics have also been anecdotally shown to help with [PTSD](https://maps.org/research/articles/6230-the-veteran-psychedelics-for-ptsd-what-a-long-strange-trip-it-s-been) and [opioid addiction](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2018/09/10/ibogaine-psychedelic-opioid-misuse-therapy). It's a field that's just now starting to gain traction and hopefully those who need help the most will be able to get it as the science develops.

***Why Compass?:***

So why $CMPS out of the many stonks in the psychedelics universe?

*1) Compass Pathways is the only psychedelics company currently listed in the US.* 

I don't mess with OTC stonks (have been burned too many times) and I don't mess with Canadian listings (who calls their currency the ""Loonie?). Don't know why other companies haven't listed in the US yet, but I'm not messing with those companies until they do.

*2) Peter Thiel is the largest shareholder and they have a superstar board/advisors.*

Everyone here knows and loves Peter Thiel; he owns 7.5% of the company. The board members at CMPS include the former R&D head at **Merck**, the former Chairman of Global Pharmaceuticals at **Johnson & Johnson**, former Executive Director of the **European Medicines Agency** among others. Their scientific advisory board includes doctors from **Stanford, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Imperial College**, etc. This is a company stacked with talent.

*3) CMPS has received FDA ""*[*breakthrough designation*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-07/psychedelic-mushroom-therapy-startup-edges-toward-fda-approval)*"" and are currently on phase 2 trials.*

Breakthrough designations are typically given when preliminary clinical trials show **significant improvements over existing treatments**. ""Breakthrough therapies are supported by the FDA throughout the clinical development programme to ensure as efficient a process as possible.""

*4) CMPS runs the COMPASS Discovery Center, which is working on finding uses for psychedelics.*

The biggest pushback against $CMPS is that they're currently only working on one product, COMP360, for the treatment of treatment resistant depression. However they also run the COMPASS Discovery Center, a collaboration between Compass Pathways and various universities to find new uses for psychedelics. **$CMPS will be the exclusive licensee for all new compounds generated.**

*5) They're just seem like good people.*

Sure this may not be important to company profits in the long term, but this is something that makes me feel a bit warm and fuzzy inside. They recently [raised](https://www.standard.co.uk/homeless-fund/compass-pathways-support-the-homeless-fund-london-b919073.html) over 1.4mil GBP (Around $2mil 'merica dollars) to **help the homeless in London**. Maybe I'm stupid, but this helps me trust the company's leaders a bit more.

**Target Price:**

I'm not a research analyst so I'm not going to break down the numbers in terms of sales of COMP360 or potential profits from licenses from potential discoveries at COMPASS Discovery Center. Smarter people than I can do that analysis...

However, just looking at how high some of the weed stocks got in 2018, I don't think a market cap of $20bn is a stretch (that would put **$CMPS at around $500 to $600 a share**) if the theme takes off. GW Pharmaceuticals, a cannabis company that specialized in creating medication from cannabis, recently got acquired for $7.2bn. I put my trust in this star-studded company to do some incredible things.

**Positions:**

5,500 shares (I don't do options) of $CMPS.

**tl;dr:** Psychedelics has the potential to help those with depression, PTSD, addiction, etc. Trust in Peter Thiel and $CMPS to take us to tendieland.",2021-02-10 18:45:39

VFF - The perfect storm in weedstocks,221,lgqyww,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgqyww/vff_the_perfect_storm_in_weedstocks/,120,1612981975.0,"Gonna keep this brief bc apes hate to read. üçÖüöÄ

VFF has the LOWEST float of any major LP at 65m shares. Deduct the approx 10m shares the ceo owns and you're looking at 55m shares float (add another couple of mil from the insiders/directors and it's even less). Less shares means high volatility means large potential energy means üî•üî•üî• in a bull market!

They are profitable right now. No other public LP can claim that now or in all of 2021. Heck CGC just said they won't become fcf positive til 2024. In the immortal words of Chris Tucker, ""do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth?"" Profit = good!

So while they can run with their silly tiny float, they are actually a great company to invest in because they actually make money, have low debt, and have over 100m in the bank. 

Low float + profitable rn + weedstocks = üî•üî•üî•üöÄüöÄüöÄüçÖüçÖüçÖ

Some of you might remember me when I told you to hop on this tendie train at 9$ [when MSFT deal happened](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j7i28q/gme_launching_right_about_now_microsoft_agreement/), by [my DD about why GameStop is worth 138$](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jcjqba/gme_long_thesis_why_40_target_is_actually_a/) or by my other posts I've made here for months. As you've noticed, I LOVE THE STOCK.

I've held through -90% at the lowest to +10,000% at the highest and I continue holding. I'm down $300k from the ATH at this point and I don't fucking care because this whole thing is far from being over.

Now get these points through your thick head:

    
* **This is a fucking volatile stock.** 

This is how it goes: it shoots up, GME gang rejoices, a bunch of retards buys at the top. Then it crashes down for a while, üåàüêª keep blabbering about how the squeeze has squoze. Rinse and repeat. Every time it shoots up it does it more violently, the amplitude getting larger and larger. And every time it does there is a number of dickheads whining about not buying earlier:

""I wish I bought at $9..."" - when it shot up to $13, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $11..."" - when it shot up to $20, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $17..."" - when it shot up to $70, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $40..."" - when it shot up to $150, and them came down

""I wish I bought at $60..."" - when it shot up to $450, and them came down

**Being in GME gang was always about not caring about temporary swings, because in the end, the price always sets a new ATH**

I've seen this shit happening so many times since October that I just sit there and smile while history repeats itself and my porfolio swings 5-6 digits.

    
    
* **GME was never a squeeze play**, despite what a lot of you retards think. 

Read any DD more than a month old, the whole company is massively undervalued . Read about Ryan Cohen, a person who made a dog food company worth $45bn and who is a fucking shark, once he sets his mind to something he will never back down. Thanks to him we now have a star team assembled at GameStop formed of [Matt Francis, CTO, former Engineering Leader at AWS; Kelli Durkin, Senior Vice President of Customer Care, former Chewy‚Äôs Vice President of Customer Service; Josh Krueger, Vice President of Fulfillment former senior fulfillment roles at Amazon, Walmart, and QVC](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/retail/2021/02/03/gamestop-announces-three-new-hires) (do I need to mention Reggie Fils-Aim√© of a fucking Nintendo?). I am a firm believer that Cohen will manage to grow GameStop at the very least to the size of Chewy ($45bn market cap). Guess what GME has? $4bn. That's 12x bagger and I'm being very conservative here.

**This is not about squeezing the hedge funds, this is about the company establishing it's true share price with wild swings along the way thanks to the üåàüêªs**. The true price for me is (conservatively) the size of Chewy, which translates to $650. I know I said $138 in my previous DD a few months ago, but it was before all the recent news of Ryan Cohen taking over with his star-team.

MOASS was a cherry on top (and still is on the table), not the main play

Also, GameStop had a $6bn in revenue in 2019, Tesla had $24bn. Think about it for a moment
    
    

* **Short interest is still through fucking roof**. 

I know you're used to 100%+ SI and the new 41% number does not quite gets you off, but it's still fucking abysmal. VW, OSTK happened on less than 20%. Also keep in mind that this number is for 1/29, literally the top when a lot of shorts covered. It does not account for all the shorting that happened on the way down to $50 which I guaran-fucking-tee you was massive. Just wait and see the next report with increased SI, the shorts never learn.



**TL;DR:** GameStop is still undervalued. Conservative PT is $650, ambitious - $1200+ (assuming Ryan Cohen's success, which I don't doubt for a single moment). Short squeeze will last for a long time similar to $TSLA squeeze, with wild swings along the way - old shorts will cover, new ones will pile in because the bLoCkBuStEr narrative is still strong. This is still a risky gamble, no such thing as a sure bet, but the risk\reward is massively skewed to the upside

If you have short-dated calls you might be fucked, might be not. If you have shares or LEAPS, just get away from screens for a while if it's unbearable for you, but ultimately you'll be fucking loaded. This is one of those situations when in a year or two the price is $3000+ and you post your cost basis of $70 and all the paper-handed bitches in the comments scream ""WOW HE FUCKING HELD GRATZ""

**Positions:** some Apr 40c, some Apr 200c and a shitload of Jan 2023 950c. Will dump the remaining cash into 2023 calls at open",2021-02-10 17:10:46
NYSE v. Off-Exchange(FINRA) Short Volumes for GME: Short Volume in Public Exchanges Wasn't Even Half of Whats Needed for 150% Drop in Short Interest,562,lgpn8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpn8y/nyse_v_offexchangefinra_short_volumes_for_gme/,117,1612975888.0,"**The drop in SI from 226% to 78% required around \~100 Million shares to cover shorts, but the NYSE only saw 49 Million Short Volume, while OFF-EXCHANGES saw about 3X as much.**

Got the **Daily Short Exchange Trade data from NYSE now** so I can compare it to the FINRA numbers that I've been using in the past. General bullet points below:

# TLDR: Check bottom, look at Figure 1, and Napkin Math.

&#x200B;

* **Publicly traded stocks(GME on the NYSE) can be traded ""upstairs"" in OFF-EXCHANGES (OTC) but have to be reported... or should be...**
* **Daily Short Sales files only contain how many short sale trades were done that day.**
* **Short sale trades done on NYSE  are NOT in the FINRA data, and vice versa.**
* **The GOOD STUFF is in the** [MONTHLY SHORT SALES FILES](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021) **and it isn't out yet for January.**

&#x200B;

To start out we can compare the total volumes for GME across the public exchange, NYSE, against the off-exchange, FINRA's numbers.

[Figure 0: I DONT HAVE ALL THE VOLUME, as YAHOO reports nearly double what NYSE and FINRA are reporting. Missing Volume was added to show Yahoo-\(NYSE+FINRA\)](https://preview.redd.it/7rohwucqflg61.png?width=752&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf399f5180a2bc22c68320fad0eb8f542c1b3299)

* *DISCLAIMER: No idea where the Missing Volume is from, but it's not on the NYSE and not being reported to FINRA? Does Yahoo count volume some other way?*
* I sure as hell didn't know that what happens in off exchanges is about five times that of public exchanges, but we got data now. Notice how it really doesn't pick up until the 13th though, and it seems to be settling down as we get further into February.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1: Comparing NYSE to OFF-EXCHANGE short volume with respect to GME's Float.](https://preview.redd.it/4qhtpaqqflg61.png?width=721&format=png&auto=webp&s=67ca1196548a84f92c5c8d87b1c83b2f863cf812)

* Figure 1 lays out just exactly where the shorts are going on. Jan 13th nearly used the entirety of the GME Float in the off-exchange.

&#x200B;

[Figure 2: Short Volume\/Total Volume from FINRA and NYSE Daily Short Volume files, respectively.](https://preview.redd.it/n0zdmv7czlg61.png?width=743&format=png&auto=webp&s=df17986998464f35f8053bb0c3c3daa92285cdf2)

* Figure 2 shows us that around \~50% of all the volume, no matter which exchange, is around shorts, even before Jan 13th.
* Jan 19th - 26th, see how the NYSE actually leads in short volume/total volume on those days, WHICH were also the same days that GME shot up toward $400+

&#x200B;

Next I wanted to run some numbers to be able to compare to other bi-monthly reports for GME and actually look at the exact numbers across the public exchange and the off-exchanges.

&#x200B;

|FINRA|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|84,529,878|155,033,361|79,236,275|
|Short Exempt Volume|1,119,003|**3,437,532**|**4,306,437**|
|Total Volume|193,791,490|415,527,741|146,617,603.00|
|Short Vol/Float|1.80|3.31|1.69|

# NOTE: SHORT EXEMPT VOLUME IS THE ONLY THING NYSE HAS MORE OF THAN OFF-EXCHANGES!

&#x200B;

|NYSE|Jan 4th-15th|Jan 16th-29th|Feb 1st-9th|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Short Volume|13,279,699|49,046,558|19,041,023|
|Short Exempt Volume|587,776|**5,075,452**|**7,304,781**|
|Total Volume|31,822,868|105,950,709|43,875,824|
|Short Vol/Float|0.28|1.05|0.41|

Now let's use some of these numbers to check some reports.

# NAPKIN MATH TIME

1. So 226% SI for around Jan 15th  and we're at 78% SI reporting now, from end of January.
2. 226-78 = \~150
3. 150% Short Interest = 150 (Shorts/SharesOutstanding)
4. Shares Outstanding = \~70Million
5. 70Million \* 1.50 = **105 Million Shorts were settled from 15th to 29th**

OK, I can believe that 105M shorts went through because that's when GME went up to to $400+

The only thing is, and here's the kicker...

# Of the 100+Million shorts only 49 Million were executed on the                     NYSE during Jan15th to 29th!

We still have 55 Million shorts that were executed those two weeks, and in the FINRA exchanges we can see the155 Million short volume.

But how/where do they do this OFF-EXCHANGE trade you might ask?

# RIGHT ON YOUR DAMN PHONE, Urist McPaperHands!!!!!

*""For market makers with a customer order to sell, they will temporarily  sell short (which gets published to the tape as a media transaction for public dissemination) and then immediately buy from their customer in a  non-media transaction that is not publicly disseminated to avoid double  counting share volumes.""*\-¬† [OTCMarkets.com](https://blog.otcmarkets.com/2018/11/13/understanding-short-sale-activity/)

* **If you sold GME via any of those apps, chances are they bought up those shares themselves AFTER they used them to cover their shorts.**
* **The rest of the shorts are just in the ether of OTC exchanges**

Granted I can't get data for how many of the shorts were fully executed, how many started to juggle around with options, but we do know that before tonight the SI was above 200% and has been updated to 78%.

I believe that the update is referring to data at the end of January. CORRECT ME IN COMMENTS!!!

**TLDR:**

1. **NYSE see's only 1/5 the volume that OFF-EXCHANGES do regarding short volumes for GME**
2. **""Short Exempts""are nearly twice as prevalent in the NYSE than OTC**
3. **Only half of the shorts were executed on the NYSE to decrease SI from 226% to 78%**
4. **Still waiting on FINRA for the**  [**FINRA Monthly Short Sale File**](https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/trf/trf-regulation-sho-2021)

&#x200B;

Not advice of any kind, I should have been writing my thesis instead of this shit, and I miss chewy runts!

Edit:  u/SolveThisProblem pointed out that different sites use different definitions for SI: In the post I used short/(outstanding shares (yahoo finance) to calculate the 226% to 78% SI change, however Morningstar/FINRA  use shorts/ float which is (Outstanding Shares - Insider Holdings - Untrading lnst.

NVAX - 3 to 4x potential - Market ignoring recurring revenue,44,lgpjiw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgpjiw/nvax_3_to_4x_potential_market_ignoring_recurring/,43,1612975417.0,"As NVAX was late to party, analysts estimated its initial revenue lower.

But given the [mutations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-struggles-with-new-virus-variants) and booster vaccine development in full steam, I think covid 19 revenue are very likely to extend beyond this year. [UK authorities are already laying out plans](https://www.ft.com/content/26b256d0-d021-46ac-ae3d-e3ea823c033d) for annual vaccination. In such scenario, NVAX is actually better placed than Moderna.

So Q2 2020 onwards, I dont see NVAX revenue to be lower than Moderna. Market is already beginning to realize that. I expect its market cap to come inline **üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

I believe most people are likely to go for Novavax when it comes to next jab because:

1. [Much lower side effects as compared to Moderna/Pfizer](https://www.racap.com/media/Covid-19/COVID-19_VX_12222020_F.pdf?v=tY2fmi5jaTcPs6s4xSzi_QUhEV8v0ayLLWYwd-p1upM)
2. Cheaper (<= $16 per dose)
3. Virus variants are becoming bigger problem. [Protein subunit vaccines are better placed for covering variants than MRNA](https://twitter.com/PeterKolchinsky/status/1354929047797706756)
4. They plan to make a [Combo vaccine with their Nanoflu](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-novavax/novavax-to-explore-combined-influenza-covid-19-vaccine-for-use-post-pandemic-idUKL4N2H42Z7?edition-redirect=uk) \- so instead of annual flu vaccine, people can simply go for combo
5. And obviously [highest efficacy (95.6% original, 86% UK, 60% SA strain)](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-covid-19-vaccine-demonstrates-893-efficacy-uk-phase-3). Only vaccine which has [evidence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.05.429759v1) of [sterilizing immunity](https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/prevention-cures/501677-what-is-sterilizing-immunity-and-do-we-need-it)

It seems incredible that `NVAX market cap is just $20B when Moderna is valued at $71B`. To reach $71B, NVAX shares will need to shoot to **$1116 üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

It can be argued that lower price than Moderna means lower revenue. But lower price coupled with no deep freeze requirement will translate to much higher market share. On top of that, they already have another very successful vaccine (Nanoflu - influenza) which completed phase 3 trial in March 2020.

On Jan 29th, Principal investigator of their UK trial had expected [full analyses target of 100 cases to be reached in 2 weeks](https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/944923#vp_2). It seems we should be pretty close to next price action now.

Some people involved with this (which is honestly a big part of why I'm about to Forest Gump my ass through Vietnam, across the fucking country, and back home to lose my virginity to a chick with AIDs just to get this thing):

* Shaq
* Kevin Mayer, Former TikTok CEO
* Lebron ""hold my dick"" James
* Arnold Schwarzenegger
* Tom Staggs, former Disney CFO & COO

The announcement ***just*** came out. [Full version](http://on.wsj.com/3aP3Gzc) for those of you with actual attention spans.

For those that don't. Here are the **highlights**:

""Fitness-and-nutrition business the Beachbody Company Group LLC plans to merge with a blank-check company affiliated with former TikTok Chief Executive Kevin Mayer in a deal that values the combined company at nearly $3 billion.""

As part of the deal, Myx Fitness LLC, an at-home connected cycling provider, will become part of The Beachbody Company.

Beachbody is expected to generate more than $1.1 billion of revenue this year.

""Beachbody said it plans to use the capital to expand its sales and digital marketing efforts and to enter new geographies""

Other awesome things about this team:

* Lebron James and Arnold Schwarzenegger are involved (to what extent, I'm not sure but Beachbody [owns the majority stake in their shared company Ladder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#Divisions))
* The company [also owns P90X](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beachbody_Company#History)

**My Basic DD:**

The company is well diversified between 3 separate entities. Each with complementary but different offerings. The fitness offering, I think, pairs really well with their roster on the team which (as covered above) is highly experienced in sports and media.

Peloton is due for a competitor. It's a great platform but it's not the solution EVERYONE needs. MYX Fitness' products offer added choice to a marketplace that is foaming at the mouth for more options.

The company has been around for over 20 years which is just a nice reassurance that the biz actual works

Because of how the deal is structured, it appears the company will now be, more than ever, able to expand via acquisitions (they actually mention this in the article) and ***HEAVY*** digital marketing spend.

Face it! We're apes. And now we're not together, because they spread lies, misinformation and doubt on reddit, news and magazines. They can trick the DUMB. Are you dumb?

I'm not going to lie, I first joined the whole train for the fast money and bought @270‚Ç¨ for 2k‚Ç¨, because I have debts of 10k‚Ç¨ and a lawsuit going against me. I can't afford to pay back anymore because COVID made me loose my job. I'm basically fucked and don't know what to do and stand with my back at the wall. But guess what?

**I STILL HOLD.**

This isn't about money anymore. This isn't about saving before shit goes down. This isn't about believe that the squeeze will come.

**This is because I believe in you retards and I want wallstreet to bleed for what they did.**

And so should you! Stop whining, stop getting in doubt.

For ONE fucking time in your life - just do **NOTHING** and **HOLD**.

WSB showed the whole world how fucked up the market is. And if they played by the rules, we'd have fucked them in a very autistic and ironic way. But guess what. War isn't held by rules.

This can also serve as a walkthrough if you still don't know how to do your own DD. So grab a beer, strap on your helmet, and review the alphabet one more time, because hopefully by the end of this you'll learn how to do your own DD.

# Financials

Ok, let's start by examining some financial metrics. Now, we don't want to just look at a snapshot of these companies' financials at the end of 2020; we also want to see what these metrics looked like before some guy decided to chow on some bat soup. This will help to give us an idea of how they changed and what to look forward to as we approach reopening.

For the 7 million of  you new here (holy fuck), or for those of you with aggressively smooth brains, I'll go over some of the more complicated metrics.

* **P/E ratio** (price-to-earnings ratio) - share price divided by EPS. This can help us determine the relative value of a company's share price compared to its competitors.
* **P/S ratio** (price-to-sales ratio) - market capitalization divided by revenue. This shows how much investors think each share is worth compared to the company's revenue.
* **Profit Margin** \- profit divided by revenue. This tells us what percent of revenue actually turns into profit.

These are simple calculations, and you can find all the data necessary on yahoo finance \[1\]. If you don't know what profit, revenue, EPS, or market cap are, then at this point just buy 0DTE SPY puts and hope for the best. Below is a table of these metrics for UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV for the year 2019.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Share Price (EOY)|Market Cap|Revenue|Profit|P/E|P/S|Profit Margin|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$88|$22.1B|$43.3B|$12.5B|7333|0.51|28.9%|
|AAL|$27|$12.4B|$45.7B|$10.4B|7105|0.27|22.8%|
|DAL|$58|$37.6B|$47.0B|$10.4B|7945|0.80|22.1%|
|LUV|$54|$28.0B|$22.0B|$6.0B|12558|1.27|27.3%|

&#x200B;

LUV's P/E and P/S ratios from 2019 may suggest that it was overvalued compared to the other airlines. But this won't matter to you once we see how much better they are doing compared to the rest of the field in 2020. Below is a table of the same metrics for these airlines for the year 2020.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Share Price (EOY)|Market Cap|Revenue|Profit|P/E|P/S|Profit Margin|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$43|$22.1B|$15.4B|\-5.0B|\-1.70|1.44|\-32.5%|
|AAL|$16|$9.8B|$17.3B|\-7.6B|\-0.87|0.57|\-43.9%|
|DAL|$40|$25.6B|$17.1B|\-6.5B|\-2.05|1.50|\-38.0%|
|LUV|$47|$26.3B|$9.0B|\-1.9B|\-8.64|2.92|\-21.1%|

&#x200B;

Again, the P/E and P/S ratios could suggest that LUV is overvalued compared to the rest of the field, but a valuation above its competitors is warranted because of how much better its profit and profit margins are. But these metrics are just a part of the picture; we also want to analyze a company's balance sheet to see how it fairs in terms of its total assets and liabilities.

# Balance Sheet

A company's balance sheet can easily be located on their annual 10-K or quarterly 10-Q SEC filings \[2\]. The data for this analysis will be extracted from each company's 10-Q form for Q3 (since not all of them have filed a 10-K for 2020). The two sections on the balance sheet we want to pay close attention to are the assets and liabilities.

In the current assets section, we'll be looking at AR (accounts receivable) and most importantly CASH, because CASH is KING. It's important for a company to have lots of cash on hand because it shows how able they are to pay off short term debts. There are other sources of assets listed in the file, but I'll skip those since they aren't as important as cash and AR.

In the current liabilities section, we'll be looking at AP (accounts payable) and maturing debt (debt that is owed pretty soon). All you need to know about AR and AP is that they are basically opposites. AR is money that a third party owes the company pretty damn soon, and AP is money that the company owes a third party pretty damn soon. A good rule of thumb is that these values should generally match up. Here as well, there are other sources of liabilities listed in the file, but I'm skipping them because they aren't as important as debt and AP.

Lastly, we'll also take a look at long-term debts and debt-to-equity ratio, to determine how much debt a company has to pay off in the future and how much debt they are leveraging to finance their assets.

Still with me? Ok good, more numbers now. Shown below is a table of the current assets of UAL, AAL, DAL, and LUV.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Total Current Assets|Cash|Accounts Receivable|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$16.5B|$13.2B|$1.2B|
|AAL|$21.4B|$0.2B|$1.1B|
|DAL|$25.0B|$16.5B|$1.5B|
|LUV|$16.1B|$12.1B|$0.9B|

There are two things you should note about this table. First, around 75% of LUV's total assets is cold hard cash. We like to see that. This also compares closely with UAL's cash. But another thing to note is how dogshit AAL's small pp pile of cash is. They're in some shit and will probably have to leverage more debt to make short-term payments. But regardless of that, so far so good for LUV. But let's see how everyone is doing with their liabilities. Shown below is a table of the current liabilities of these airlines.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Total Current Liabilities|Current maturities of long-term debt|Accounts Payable|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$15.8B|$4.6B|$1.8B|
|AAL|$16.3B|$2.7B|$1.0B|
|DAL|$19.7B|$5.0B|$2.4B|
|LUV|$7.8B|$0.7B|$1.0B|

Hopefully by now you're starting to see how much doper LUV is compared to its competitors. LUV has more than double the current assets to liabilities, less than $1 billion in short-term debt (which is easily covered by their amount of cash), and generally equal AR and AP. No other company listed here checks all three boxes.

Finally, we'll examine long-term debt and debt-to-equity ratio shown in the table below.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Long-term Debt|Debt-to-Equity Ratio|
|:-|:-|:-|
|UAL|$22.3B|7.74|
|AAL|$26.5B|\-12.36|
|DAL|$29.8B|22.6|
|LUV|$10.1B|2.64|

Immediately glaring off that table is the fact that DAL is levered to the tits and AAL has a negative debt-to-equity ratio. So in essence, DAL is dogshit, and AAL is dogshit wrapped in catshit. But our shining star LUV has a debt-to-equity ratio of only 2.64 which, when considering how the pandemic has impacted air travel, is pretty fucking stellar. And compared to the rest of the field, LUV is sitting pretty with only $10 billion in long-term debt.

# Business Operations

Now that we've seen the numbers, it's time to dig a little deeper to see how Southwest's business operations will lead it through the reopening. Most of the following information can be found in Southwest's 10-K filing (I'll link any alternative sources). Southwest began operations in 6 new airports in 2020 and plans to begin operations in 8 more airports in 2021, including Chicago O'Hare (hint: that's a big one).

The Boeing 737 MAX also has a role to play in all of this. These aircraft are more fuel efficient than their predecessors (hint: this saves costs), and Southwest is quick to add them to their fleet. I know you're probably thinking the MAX is dangerous and a liability to the company, but I promise you the MAX is probably the safest plane in the sky right now because Boeing knows they'd be in deep shit if they fucked it up again. Southwest will start flying MAXs again in March, and they currently lease or own 41 of these aircraft, which is about 5% of their fleet. This year they will be adding 107 more MAX 7s and MAX 8s, which will then make up 17% of their fleet.

But what really sets Southwest apart from these other large airlines is that the vast majority of their business is domestic, so during a reopening economy, they will see operations return to normal much faster than their competitors that also rely on revenue from international flights.

Finally, Southwest continues to offer low fares in part due to their use of higher complexity flight plan optimization models. They use linear flight systems instead of the simpler and more common hub and spoke methods that other airlines utilize \[3\]. If all that flew over your head, don't worry, all you need to know is that this helps Southwest save costs.

# Institution Holdings

For any DD, it's also important to see if institutions own a certain stock. It's always good to have the big boys on your side in an investment. Let's see how institutional ownership compares across the airlines we've been studying.

&#x200B;

|Ticker|Institutional Ownership|
|:-|:-|
|UAL|57.2%|
|AAL|43.8%|
|DAL|60.9%|
|LUV|76.0%|

As you can see, the big boys favor LUV over the rest \[4\].

# Technicals

Fuck outta here with your crayons. This is a DD for a long-term play so miss me with those head and shoulders, cup and handle, batman, or dick n balls lookin ass patterns.

# Final Notes on Macroeconomic Trends

After being locked down for a year, there's going to be some serious pent up demand for vacations and travel. Southwest is in a perfect position to meet these demands with its low fares, and will emerge from the pandemic mostly unscathed relative to its competitors. Also, two bags fly free? Say no more fam. With that being said, I think Southwest is on pace to eclipse its ATH and I see its share price worth no less than $80 EOY (maybe more considering the retard strength of this market).

However, this thesis and price target is completely invalid if the market turns bearish, no matter how successful the reopening is for airlines. But, as long as the Federal Reserve continues to support the heights of this market, then calls on everything.

&#x200B;

Positions: LUV 1/20/23 70C

&#x200B;

If you made it this far, congratulations. If you didn't, fuck you, read the TL;DR I guess. Did I leave anything important out? Do you disagree with my thesis because of some critical information that I didn't pick up on? Let me know. Also if you enjoyed this and want to see another DD, I'll take some suggestions.

&#x200B;

TL;DR

* LUV profited way better than its competitors during the pandemic
* LUV has a great balance sheet compared to its competitors
* LUV is adding more destinations and using more MAX aircraft ($$$$$)
* Institutions love LUV
* Pent up demand for travel this year means $$$$$$

Why BB's Contract with Motional is Bigger than We Realise.,330,lgl1ub,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgl1ub/why_bbs_contract_with_motional_is_bigger_than_we/,73,1612957100.0,"There are already numerous posts about the news that can out today but I wanted to put this out there because I saw a common theme among the comments that a lot of people don't know how big Motional is.


https://www.techrepublic.com/article/blackberrys-qnx-to-power-motionals-driverless-vehicle-platform/


I had the same reaction until I looked them up. Motional is not some fly-by-night start-up.


1. They are a $4 Billion joint venture between Hyundai and Aptiv where Hyundai put in $1.4 Billion dollars and has the backing of the South Korean government which expects them to have fleet rollout by 2024.


That means we know there's some serious intent with this company and they have the money to pay for BB's products.


https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21362322/hyundai-aptiv-motional-autonomous-vehicle-joint-venture


2. Motional isn't just a concept, it has a product out on the roads right now. As of Feb last year, they already had 100k paying customers via Lyft. That's right, they already had a soft roll out. They are targetting a full self driving robotaxi service with lift in 2023.


https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/16/motional-and-lyft-target-2023-to-deploy-driverless-robotaxi-services-in-major-u-s-cities/


3. On the same note, they are launching robotaxis with Via in the first half of this year. This year!


https://motional.com/press_article/motional-and-via-partner-to-launch-a-platform-for-public-on-demand-shared-robotaxi-rides/


4. Along with Amazon WS IVY partnership expecting to make bank in 2023. It seems like BB is poised for an explosion in revenues starting in 2023. Most tech companies out there are priced well into the future yet BB seems to be priced for this or next year at most. If the market can wake up to this then BB could do really well. 

This is on top of Baidu, and all the existing clients of QNX.

Time to talk about UNG,0,lgmxdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgmxdj/time_to_talk_about_ung/,27,1612964124.0,"Mods blocked my first post for some reason so here it is again

Haven't heard much on WSB about the freezing cold hitting the US these next weeks so I wanted to point out a strategy with retard level returns. About half the homes in the use [natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/images/whf_longformat_0132018.pdf) to heat their home and the other half uses electricity, but guess [what the majority of electricity generated in the US is with natural gas](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20was%20the%20largest,in%202019%E2%80%94about%2023%25) at 38%. Most people are ignoring it because of the green stock push, but the only green is dollar bills :D Starting tomorrow and in the upcoming weeks its going to get extremely [cold](https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/predictions/814day/index.php).

Why does this matter? Supply and Demand baby production has not recovered from its its drop last year and is not expected to return to normal until [2022](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46476). This means that production is not replenishing storage as fast as other years. Right now there is a small surplus in working storage if weather holds (hence the long term trade) that surplus will be a deficit by Feb 19. At that point working storage is going to be 2000 BCF.  Here is the kicker there working storage can't go lower than 1000 Bcf of gas because there needs to be natural gas in the pipelines for them to work. The closer it gets to this number there, the price of natgas is going to shoot up!! Officially working storage does not stop getting emptied until the 2nd week of April meaning there is going be 8 weeks of withdraws.

The best part is that there will always be a buyer for natural gas!! Utilities will always need to buy  natural gas for electrical generation. Right now they are in denial and just keep wishing that the problem goes away. But just ask [Japanese utilities](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/asian-spot-lng-price-hits-record-on-cold-winter-supply-crunch) what happens when storage starts to run low!!!

**Why buy now** its cheap right now, most traders are waiting for winter to verify and the utilities are hoping that it never happens. Of course you should only be trying this if you can afford to.

$UNG is the ETF that tracks natural gas and will start going to the moon the lower the storage goes.

There are also many natural gas producers that will benefit with the rise of the price. This is especially true if management takes advantage of the price move and locks in prices for the rest of the year (they have the ability to do that) .

Because this is WSB I found the Natural gas producer with the largest short percentage at 16%. That would be RRC

For those of you that want to follow the [natural gas storage numbers](https://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html) (updated every Thursday at 10:30 ET)

**TLDR:** If you can afford to buy UNG now because its gonna get really cold in the US for the next three weeks. If you want to go full retard and attempt a short squeeze RRC is your best bet with 16% of its volume float at 16%.

Welp, I'm familiar with the furniture/mattress industry.  The demand for furniture and mattresses is through the roof right now.  You can verify this yourself if you want.  Go to your local furniture store and ask how long it will take to custom order a sofa (change the fabric/leather).  The likely answer will be 6-8 months.  This is obviously because of Covid.  


Prices for furniture and mattresses are rising on an almost weekly basis right now.  This is due to Covid shutdowns at the factories, the stimulus checks being right in the wheelhouse of furniture prices (hmmm, stuck at home and I just got $600-$1200 for ""free"" what should I buy? A new sofa!), and, believe it or not, a hurricane a few months ago that wiped out foam factories and caused a huge delay in manufacturing.


I'm long PRPL (I know it was a meme stock on WSB for a while, but look at it's gains over the last year).


Long LZB.  They're 7-8 months out for new orders right now (I know this because I still get their ""update"" emails for retailers for some reason).



And I'm long ~~TSI~~ (edit TSX, whoops).  Tempur-pedic and Sealy merged a few years ago, but they didn't fully integrate their operations until last month.  They actually shut down production of their mattresses in December until Jan 15 of this year so they could optimize their production.  Up until that point, they were essentially operating as two separate companies.  Not anymore.

It's no secret that this sub is full of people making fun of the GME bag holders.  I know what you're thinking, they're just so retarded that you can't help make fun of them.  But according to the highly intelligent analysis on reddit, hedge funds are actually paying people to post on reddit to try to get retail investors to sell their 0.748589 shares.

So since people are shitting on bag holders anyways, let's make a recruitment thread where you can put your shitposting resume and get some of that sweet hedge fund / wall street money.

Get in quick, because the reddit experts have assured me that the sub is overrun with shills and bots, so this is your chance to get paid.

Not only did the GameStop coalition make some of you brilliant people pay off their student loans, put down payments on houses, and make multiple charitable donations to great causes, but it caused the world to see the flaws in the 'system' and 'the free market'. I'm in my late twenties and I've seen the best this country can't be.

My dad is a salesman. Growing up as a kid in the 90s, he supported me and my three siblings our whole lives. Before the the 2000s, bonuses were spread throughout the company he worked for at the time. If the company did well, if the sales people did a good job for the company they work for, everyone was given a fair bonus in accordance with the profits brought in. This way of comradery (fairness) doesn't seem to exist anymore. We see it as a fantasy that both the CEO and subordinates, that earn the company the real profits, can both profit together.

Everyone involved in the day-to-day labor worked their tails off for the betterment of the company they put the hours in for. All for the wellbeing for them and their families. Both the higher ups and 'underlings' worked in sync with one another for the most part, that being the chairmen of the company and the salespeople/installers that are involved in selling/implementing the product and all prospered from the work being done. 

I am affected by that dream. I am censored by the billionaires/trillionaires that exist today. This trickle down effect where someone can be a literal trillionaire and the people under them are making fractions of those fractions of a salary for them and their families makes me nauseous. I'm tired of witnessing the general public just accepting it for the sign of the times. To be honest, it goes way past accepting it when it comes to the big wigs literally shutting trading down for people like us. People that see the shift in where it should be to where it is now. 

I am fully in support of $GME and I hope the stock goes stratospheric like we all hope it will. But if you cant afford it, stocks like $BB, $PLTR, or $AMC should not be given up on. I guess I would just like to say I care for you and your future gains deeply and lets never give up trying to get back the American Dream that was promised to us after those crazy student loans or incredible debt. Good luck and Good fortune to all of you. Lets rock the world.

The real GME play is next month's earnings,120,lglvol,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglvol/the_real_gme_play_is_next_months_earnings/,157,1612960116.0,"Listen up apes; I know lots of you lost a lot of money over the past couple of weeks because you jumped on the hype train too late and bought the peak. I didn't. I invested in GME in December and took my 3000% profits on the 29th when it became clear that the momentum was over and that Wall Street would play all sorts of dirty tricks to prevent a true parabolic squeeze. I may not be half the autist that u/deepfuckingvalue is, but since I actually made money off this stock maybe you should listen to me instead of the bagholding conspiracy theorists who have been reaching the top of this sub lately.

GME won't be going to $1000, or even return to $420.69 anytime soon. That being said, GME is still an undervalued company with great growth potential. Lots of smart people have put out excellent DD on this company and I won't attempt to equal their work; if you want an overview and some valuation estimates just visit [gmedd.com](https://gmedd.com) or watch Roaring Kitty's old streams.

Here's the deal: short interest is still pretty high and mainstream investors largely remain convinced of the BS ""next Blockbuster"" narrative. This belief, plus the WSB bagholders who are gradually cashing out is pushing the stock below the $60-$100 range I believe to be approximate fair market value. **GME is unlikely to rocket again until this belief is challenged, and the best opportunity for that to happen is the Q4 earnings announcement in late March**.

[In the sales report released early last month](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-reports-2020-holiday-sales-results), Gamestop reported strong sales figures for the incomplete 4th quarter of 2020 and indicated that it expects to report a profitable earnings report in March. **If GME reports a Q4 profit next month, it will directly refute the bear thesis of financial ruin and impending bankruptcy. This could cause another short/gamma squeeze around earnings, though likely smaller in scale than craziness a couple weeks ago.** The earnings announcement could also include new information about the company's innovation efforts, improvements in e-commerce and customer service, and creation of new revenue streams (PC building kiosks anyone?)

This is not financial advice and you should make investment decisions according to your own research, investment goals, and personal risk tolerance. I currently have 63 GME short puts at the $60 strike expiring on 2/19, and after assignment I plan to hold through earnings and maybe buy a few calls beforehand.

Naked shorting in GME and how the pieces suddenly fit together,11997,lglrg5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/,1202,1612959657.0,"TLDR: **Naked shorting appears prevalent in GME, and if true was likely aided by DTCC, whom by extension may have shut down the short squeeze on 1/28 because it would've caused a massive scandal had the squeeze happened**. I know ape can't read but I implore you to read the whole thing (originally wasn't going to add a TLDR but decided to add it just so more people will read even just a little bit)

I was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of GME which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to GME. I was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes. This is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle, I could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now:

One of the interesting things about GME and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by Finra to be 226%, and later in the range of 150% percent of total float. Another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of FTIDs ([https://wherearetheshares.com/](https://wherearetheshares.com/)). Both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal. In addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist (there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme\_institutions\_hold\_177\_of\_float\_why\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/)). Where do these shares come from? One potential explanation is synthetic long shares (created via a loophole described here [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting.

I‚Äôm an entrepreneur, not a finance expert, so I started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject. I started with this [https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm). ‚ÄúFailures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale. There may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver. For example, human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than book-entry form, thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal three-day settlement period. **A fail may also result from ‚Äúnaked‚Äù short selling**.‚Äù

Interesting. We have a consistent and very high rate of FTIDs dating from 2020 and beyond, an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time.

According to former Chairman of the SEC Christopher Cox, ‚ÄúAbusive **naked short sales... can be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price** to the detriment of all of its investors. The Commission is particularly concerned about **persistent failures to deliver in the market** for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the Commission's Regulation SHO, adopted just two years ago‚Ä¶ Selling short without having stock available for delivery, and **intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard three-day settlement period, is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws**‚Ä¶ We are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that **substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities.** Specifically, these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership - voting, lending, and dividends from issuers. Moreover, **they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling, which could be used as a tool to drive down a company's stock price**. (Source:[ https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2006/spch071206cc2.htm))

In a different speech Mr Cox re-iterated that short selling helps prevent ""irrational exuberance and bubbles. But **when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position, after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed, that is not contributing to an orderly market ‚Äì it is undermining it.‚Äù** Mr Cox also ‚Äúreferred to ""the serious problem of abusive naked short sales‚Äù as ‚Äú**a tool to drive down a company's stock price**"" and that the SEC is ""concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to **loopholes in Regulation SHO**"" (which reminds me of this piece I wrote [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) (source for SEC Chairman‚Äôs words: [https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm](https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2008/spch071808cc.htm))

As another datapoint, Robert J. Shapiro, former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that **naked short selling has cost investors $100 billion and driven 1,000 companies into the ground**. (Source: This was originally in a time magazine article from 2005 which was deleted[ https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html](https://time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126706-3,00.html) but the statement still exists in record in an SEC Filing from 2008[ https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-08/s70808-170.htm))

I also read ‚Äò**One complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a company's shares** for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books. This has been alleged to create ""**phantom"" or ""counterfeit"" shares**, sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares, and **artificially depressing the share price‚Äô**‚Äù. Shortly after, I read that Matt Taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers. Taibbi said that the two firms got a ""push"" into extinction from ""a flat-out counterfeiting scheme called naked short-selling"". (Source:[ https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall\_streets\_naked\_swindle](https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/30481512/wall_streets_naked_swindle))

All these sources above seem to support the theory that GME stock was wildly naked shorted, which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed. If investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage, GME was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen -- potentially even an infinite short squeeze. On 1/26 Elon tweeted about Gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of WSB. The goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze, the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze.

On 1/28 Thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pre-trading started (the stock shot up to 513 in pre-trading) and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day, the momentum was suddenly shut down when Robinhood (where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on) were shut off from the ability to buy GME stock and only allow selling, followed by several other brokers. Many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying (but funds were not.) When this happened people were upset at Robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between Robinhood and Citadel (which along with Point72 invested a lifeline of 2.5 billion to Melvin Capital, one of the short side funds, and is also responsible for something like 40% of Robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books), but many also speculated collusion with DTCC itself. Now, personally speaking, its kind of crazy to think about DTCC being complicit in something like this. However, looking into the details of what happened, a skeptical part of me became suspicious.

Apparently what triggered the shut down on trading GME on that day was DTCC sending a letter at 4 am to Robinhood requiring them to come up with 3 billion dollars ([https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/](https://fortune.com/2021/02/02/robinhood-gamestop-restricted-trading-meme-stocks-gme-amc-vlad-tenev-nscc/)) . So it sounds like it was essentially this DTCC letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on GME and the short squeeze happening. On that day, there were theories thrown out that DTCC was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of GME and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow back/scandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen. Assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to 1000 or beyond (which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze), hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts, and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag. Worse, DTCC would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing, I imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least.

Then I read something that caught my eye‚Ä¶ DTCC has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts. From an article dating back to 2007, ‚ÄúDepository Trust & Clearing Corp. is a little-known institution in the nation's stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job: It is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers. About 99% of the time, trades are completed without incident. But about 1% of the shares -- valued at about $2.5 billion on a given a day -- aren't delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days, for one reason or another. **These ""failures to deliver"" have put DTCC in the middle of a long-running fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies' share prices**.‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

Apparently the DTCC has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time. According to Wall Street Journal ‚Äú**There is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens. The fight is over how prevalent the problem is -- and the extent to which DTCC is responsible**. Some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame DTCC as the keepers of the system where it happens. DTCC and others say it isn't widespread enough to be a major concern.‚Äù (Source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720)).

""It has been alleged in **tens or hundreds of lawsuit**s that the DTCC and its **Prime Broker owners have abused their monopoly position to create numerous techniques that allow for the creation of counterfeit shares through naked shorting** that facilitate stock manipulation by hedge funds. Law suits have been brought against Merrell. Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JP Morgan, UBS, other market makers and also the DTCC. The Prime Brokers and DTCC have fought back ferociously against these lawsuits with great success and **have been largely successful in blocking attempts to gain access to their transaction data bases. The information that they do release is incomplete, self-serving and misleading**. (Source: [https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/](https://smithonstocks.com/part-3-in-series-on-illegal-naked-shortings-role-in-stock-manipulation-prime-brokers-and-the-dtcc-have-a-troubling-monopoly-on-clearing-and-settling-stock-trades/))

As a thought experiment, lets say naked shorting is rampant in GME (many many indicators point to this) and lets say DTCC was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on GME, wouldn‚Äôt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesn‚Äôt get out and blow up in their faces? Something to consider. Because had they not done what they did on 1/28 Thursday, many traders believe the squeeze would‚Äôve happened that day.

From the Wall Street Journal: ‚ÄúThe Securities and Exchange Commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice. The latest move came last month, when the SEC further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale. But **some critics argue the SEC still hasn't done enough**‚Ä¶ Some delivery failures linger for weeks or months. Until that failure is resolved, there are effectively additional shares of a company's stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyer's account, critics say. **This ""phantom stock"" can put downward pressure on a company's share price by increasing the supply‚Ä¶ Critics contend DTCC has turned a blind eye to the naked-shorting problem.‚Äù** (source: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118359867562957720))

From everything I‚Äôve seen, as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from 1/26, many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented. I personally hold the following hypothesis:

* GME shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being 221% and 150% at various times, and as late as 1/28 reported by S3 to be 122% [https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355246955874701314)
* GME shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs ([https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence\_points\_to\_gme\_shorts\_not\_having\_covered/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered/)) and using those to ‚Äúcover‚Äù their positions but not truly covering, which is illegal to cover using this particular method, and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed, potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close
* As a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more GME shares then the actual float
* The counterfeit shares can/have been used in [aggressive naked short attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf4vn3/yes_laddering_is_real_short_ladder_attack_is_just/) to further drive down the price of GME, which may have led to the precipitous price drop starting last Monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to [artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leorks/evidence_points_to_gme_shorts_not_having_covered)
* Due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to, DTCC which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts, may‚Äôve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in GME
* There was potentially collusion on 1/28 to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby DTCC may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts, it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed.

**Edit: Matt Taibbi's rolling stone article is highly relevant and good reading on this subject** [**https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/**](https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/wall-streets-naked-swindle-194908/)**, so many parallels that the signs are hard to miss. Even if you've read it before, recommend reading it again. Shows me that if the hypothesis posed is true, Prime brokers are likely complicit. Prime brokers also happen to own the DTCC.**

**This brings up another interesting thought experiment: On 1/28 when the price was 450+ and shorts were likely under 100, if we assume prime brokers allowed naked shorting in GME, then when the squeeze was about to happen (or happening), if brokers margin called the shorts, they would presumably also go down because shorts would not be able to pay in that event and the brokers would be holding the bag. By that logic, they have every incentive in this case to NOT to margin call because doing would also taken them down and they would lose a lot of money. Instead the most logical option would probably be to make a backroom deal, which is what I personally think mostly likely happened.**

A cross trade is a practice where buy and sell orders for the same asset are offset without recording the trade on the exchange. It is an activity that is not permitted on most major exchanges.

Why is it important?

This is important for one particular stock that shan‚Äôt be named, because when you cross trade, it doesn‚Äôt affect the price of that particular stock.

Now what these traders are doing to beat the system is, they are buying stocks when the market is close, and sell those stocks when the market is open. Creating a massive negative pressure, when we plebs are looking at the price, but no effect when they are buying their stocks and we are asleep.

TLDR- Imagine a boat where you row forward every time you buy a stonk, and row backwards every time you sell.

I see people who don't get the concept of yolo and think this is some sort of investing forum or collective get rich quick scheme, and sadists who think it's a place to *""egg people on into doing a stupid bet then laughing at the results""*.  Maybe I'm wrong, but to me none of that has ever been WSB.

I'm not trying to gatekeep the culture, I wasn't here at the start although I have been around on and off for more than 5 years, and I think of WSB as a place where we make or become market memes, and occasionally share an intelligent high risk bet, or the large gains/losses from one. 

A place where there's more discussion than *""I like the stock""* - often using leverage or options in ways that will lose a novice money. A place where money is taken lightly and no one is gambling their house even if they are putting hundreds of thousands on the line.

I don't really care if people want to keep holding Gamestop in hopes of triggering a short squeeze to a million, if they can do it that's fine, but there's no finesse to pressing the buy button on a stock and honestly it's kind of boring compared to past plays. DFV's play was interesting and WSB worthy because he came up with a thesis, had conviction and posted the results, and along the way he didn't just buy stock he also flipped options to make like $13+ million in addition to the stock he was holding. Excellent content.

I'm curious to hear what other people who have been around here for more than 6 months think as well. Is there any way to keep the old culture, is it a lost cause with so much new blood, or maybe you even like the new evolution of WSB?

* Kurt Wolf, a Director of GameStop **sold 810,000** shares of GME on January 12/13th at **$19 - $30.**

Now please explain to me how you, a reddit user with a moderate amount of karma, can justify a price for GameStop that is higher than $36 per share. What do you know that the insiders who work for the company do not know? Please enlighten everyone about ‚Äúcloud gaming‚Äù or whatever. Maybe call Kurt Wolf and explain it to him.

##People were horrible to Andrew Left

He's a douche. I get it. People were too mean to him though. People made it way too personal. It's fucking scary seeing you guys turn into a mob. Remember when Reddit tried to find the Boston Bomber, they accused the wrong guy, and he [censored by automod]? That was super fucked up. I'm glad nothing like that happened with Andrew Left, but you guys probably scared the shit out of his friends and family.

##Takeaway: Next time you see an angry, stupid mob trying to justify their greed as ""a movement"" tell them to fuck right off

You want to invest money in a way that makes the world a better place? Read this: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/ethical-investing.asp

You want to donate money to charity? Read this: https://www.effectivealtruism.org/

But if you want to join a pump-n-dump while deluding yourself into believing that you're doing it for the greater good, then keep that shit to your fucking self because it's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

##In closing, a wager

If GME goes to $500 by the end of February, I will drink my own piss.

If GME does not break $500 by the end of February, you have to promise to read a book about investing, personal finance, or philanthropy.

Uber FD DD... 50/50,28,lgkw39,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgkw39/uber_fd_dd_5050/,47,1612956539.0,"So, I was just burned on Lyft and Uber puts because I didn‚Äôt do any DD and went in with just a ‚Äòguess‚Äô and ‚Äòanecdotal‚Äô evidence that they would have bad earnings and a larger loss than usual. So, I present to you my grappling at straws reversal. 


So Uber is the most well known ride sharing service with a market cap of $110 billion whilst still not being profitable despite many desperate  suggestions that they will turn a profit by the end of 2020. 
Uber has had a hard year as their revenue dipped 50% due to the virus and their losses tripled. They were hemorrhaging cash like always but more. And then they took the unprecedented step of selling their AI research division off. This has huge implications as from my understanding was their business model was to get a huge market share of the industry and then when autonomous vehicles are around it will enable robotaxis making them humongous profit.


This may seem bad but it‚Äôs very bullish. They sold it to start-up Aurora Technologies and will invest $400million giving it a 26% stake. This would be 10% of their revenue pre-covid and a much larger %age in these cash-strapped times. Though Uber has a very strong balance sheet dropping pre-covid from 10B to 6B in their most recent earnings - Q3 2020. This shows they are actually pushing to achieve profitability and may give a nice speech for earnings showing their bullish gameplan. 



UberEats was much less of a cash loss than Uber whilst still being a cash hole and during the pandemic this really shone through. Delivery rose 134% year on year. Also have you noticed their new ubereats fees such as the service fee? Bullish.



Ubers Q4 2020 earnings is after market close today and their EPS estimate is $-0.56. This is  huge expectation and I think it would be their most profitable earnings ever. Q1 2020 their EPS was -1.7 and Q4 2019 it was -0.63 - just pre-covid.
‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm not so bullish anymore but a FD is a FD. 



Lyft shares had an EPS of $-0.58 beating estimates of %-0.72 and they didn‚Äôt have the same opportunities such as fortifying their balance sheet by ‚Äòselling‚Äô their autonomous vehicle division or a profitable food delivery division.



Finally, I just want to make my money back and so this DD is just to justify myself and hope for the best. Pre-market prayer can start from now.

There is also a file entitled ""Consolidated TRF/ADF Daily Short Sale  Volume Files,"" which combines the volume for trades in exchange-listed  securities reported to the TRFs and the ADF.*""

I‚Äôve noticed that barely anybody is talking about this stock even though they had multiple commercials during the superb-owl. 

ViacomCBS which owns - Nickelodeon, ‚≠êÔ∏èBET, VH1, MTV, Comedy Central, C M T, and Paramount pictures

Is collabing with CBS which owns - Showtime, CBS access, and Sports ball (like NFL, NBA, College football championships, and the PGA Worldtour). 

To create their own streaming service. Disney + has already took all their content off of other streaming platforms and these services have the right to strip their content off Titans like Hulu and Netflix as well. 

Nickelodeon - has started their slime cam on NFL games to add their own cartoon touch to it. (yeah it‚Äôs corny, but it‚Äôs a nice twist) 

BET and C M T - have a select audience who would much rather pay for a streaming service then stay on cable tv to watch their programs.

VH1, MTV, Comedy Central - these channels are most of the older generations demographic and if they put old vintage content on there (MTV Cribs, Tosh.0, Beavis and butt-head) I see a lot of people wanting to relive those shows.

Paramount pictures - produced the Wolf of Wallstreet. I don‚Äôt even have to say anymore. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

CBS - is America‚Äôs most watched network for the 12th consecutive year. That means humans really like this TV guys.

I‚Äôm not saying this is a million dollar idea and im not a financial advisor. I just really like the stock and it‚Äôs potential is endless. Netflix is at $559 a share and I can easily see this one hitting $150 by the end of this year.

I suggest you guys read those first, because I won't repeat earlier points I've made in other posts. I'm here to give you guys a final Aphria headsup before merger. I won't post again before merger, because I think this is the final moment to buy into APHA before merger at a reasonable price. Next post will be about gains after merger.

# Introduction (another look back)

Well, well, well. I have to take you guys back to the beginning. After a long time lurking, the Aphria posts were my first DD posts on this subreddit. What a journey that has been. I have to remind you guys that before [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k450e6/why_apha_is_set_for_a_50_gain/) by [u/WatAb0utB0b](https://www.reddit.com/user/WatAb0utB0b/) after they acquired Sweetwater, basically nobody on this sub was talking about Aphria. Then I made my post after the merger announcement, still almost nobody else was talking about it and I was laughed at (again a shout-out to the guy that advised me to buy an Xbox instead of APHA). When people saw the gains come in after the senate turned blue and I made my follow-up post, some people finally took notice (although still not a lot). And here we are right at this very moment, the entire subreddit is currently talking about it. 

I know my DD probably wasn't the most best/detailled you guys will ever read. But I'd still like to think that my initial post inspired some others to buy APHA or do their own DD. I'd like to imagine some dude YOLO'd his life savings into it when he read my post and that person is sitting in Hawaii right now sipping on some coconut milk, getting his cock sucked by a hooker named Stacy and enjoying his life. That feeling is exactly why I am writing this last DD post for you retards right now. Hopefully everyone reading this post will listen to me now and I can make some more of you autists rich.

# There's no denying it: Cannabis market heading back to 2018 levels

I told you guys before, once the good news rally begins then we were going to head for the moon because of the volatility of cannabis stocks. This is exactly what happened. Cannabis will undoubtedly be federally legalized in the USA now. There might be minor political obstructions, but there's no stopping the general movement. Once the American legalization movement is done, it will probably also influence European regulators. Cannabis stock should be a part of your portfolio at this point. If it isn't already, let me give you another couple of reasons why.

**It's not about the joints, it's about the CBD oil.** Let's be honest: to most people cannabis will still be seen as an addicting drug you should avoid because of the years that regulators spent demonizing it. You know which product doesn't suffer from a bad image? CBD motherfucking oil, I would even say it has a very positive image. Most people probably think about it like this: joints = junkees in the park getting high, CBD oil = people suffering from cancer relieving their pain. Its healing effects might be scientifically doubted, that doesn't change the general consensus about the product.  
You should even think past the direct 'healing' effects, CBD oil is becoming a popular supplement for regular people. People will be buying drinks, food, even fucking shampoo with CBD oil in it. The market for it is the most promising across all cannabis products, because it is the most likely to become popularised throughout North America and also be partially legalized in countries that still ban marihuana (EU mostly). Growth estimates currently are that the total CBD oil market should roughly quintuple by 2025.

**Markets are fucking insane right now, cannabis mania 2.0 is inevitable.** I don't have to tell you guys about it. This is the ideal investing climate for the cannabis market to go bonkers again, except this time there is actually nothing holding it back. The naysayers have no valid arguments against cannabis anymore like they had in 2018. There is absolutely a bubble blowing up right at this moment, so I quote old pal George Soros: ""The first thing I do when I notice a bubble is invest more"". The bubble isn't popping anytime soon people. Green energy, EV, cannabis: all these markets have very positive futures ahead of them. Cannabis might even be a long term hold this time around, can you guys believe it? The stock that has been memed so hard and struggled their way through the last couple of years is finally a worthy boomer investment. Praise the lord, Amen.

# Aphria/Tilray merger arbitrage: TLRYtards are missing out

**There is no reason to pick Tilray over Aphria. There, I said it.** I talked all about the possible arbitrage in my previous post, but here is a small summary. Aphria and old Tilray are merging to new Tilray. Aphria will get a 62% stake in new Tilray, old Tilray will get a 38% stake. To account for this split, Aphria owners will receive 0.8381 shares for each APHA share they own. Tilray stock holders will not see any changes to their holdings. There is arbitrage/free tendies because the APHA to TLRY ratio is lower than 0.8381. The only risks are (1) the merger doesn't go through or (2) the split/ratio is adapted to Aphria's detriment, both seem highly unlikely because the merger was already publicly announced. 

Back then APHA to TLRY ratio was 0.67 and it has even worsened to roughly 0.57 at this moment. I've seen other people post about this, but they are missing something. As we move closer and the specific merger date is announced, the APHA to TLRY ratio will undoubtedly move to 0.8381 so TLRY must fall or APHA must skyrocket by that date. The thing others are missing in their DD's is from the point you buy APHA, the matter if the APHA to TLRY split corrects itself doesn't matter to you personally anymore. All you have to do is compare YOUR buy-in price with the Tilray price. As long as that ratio is below the merger ratio of 0.8381, you will profit from the merger. It's as simple as that.

**TLDR:** Cannabis = arguably best growth market for the near future or long term. Aphria = best candidate in the market because of APHA/TLRY merger. APHA to TLRY price ratio doesn't match with merger agreement = free tendies, no reason to pick Tilray. This is IMO the last time to buy in for a reasonable price.

**Positions:** I still have my measily 30 shares @ $8.74 that I've been holding since the start of December. If GME squeezes before the merger and I finally decide to cash in, I will probably buy more.",2021-02-10 09:55:45

Anyone that's been here a while knows this kind of trash talk especially isn't normal or okay, it's not what we're about. We LOVE when people fuck up and lose a bunch of money, it's a fucking celebration, not a witch hunt. So what is a lone ape in a scary crowded jungle to do? Think about your situation. A large hedge fund vs. Reddit army story was shot out into the public. Mysteriously, buying ability was cut before the projected timing of the squeeze on social media. Shortly after, there were many warning posts of the remaining dirty tactics that we would face in the coming weeks, the serious manipulation, and the fact that it would realistically work on a lot of people. Mark Cuban stopped by, gave us some sweet tips, and warned us that very likely they think they're smarter than us & kept shorting. We are now in those coming weeks, and we are being mercilessly invaded with BS. This clearly indicates that there is an active effort to manipulate our users, which is a sign to me that we are on the path to doing some damage, and who else would target this community in this way? They have picked their side of this tug of war. Now, what side have others picked? Ask yourself this - if you were ANOTHER hedge fund right now, or any wealthy individual who dabbles in investing, would you jump on the short train and try to bankrupt Gamestop, kick back and watch, or buy GME? You are all out here looking like fools if you think the rich people that AREN'T shorting GME aren't trying to jump on this fucking money rocket. These people are rich for a reason, they are playing fucking 4D chess on y'all stupid fucks while you pick your nose and can't remember why you bought the stock you literally bought two fucking weeks ago. You have doubts now because your 30 year old neighbor who invests in bonds made a comment about how loaded you'd be if you sold at $400. Stay strong in your resolve, take note of the clues around you, and remember what convinced you this was a good decision in the first place. Unless you're a mouth breathing humanoid who just wanted to 10x their pathetic life savings instantly and bought in without reading more than three sentences, in which case, you're probably in the right place so just shut the fuck up for a while until this blows over. 

This is not financial advice I kinda just like the stock.

tl;dr - there are a lot of other people/hedge funds that invest money that aren't active on WSB or currently shorting GME, and they've probably put some thought into how they can most profit off of this situation based on actual analysis. I'm not one of those smart guys but it seems like usually the answer where more rich people get richer is how it goes.

EDIT: I've been looking at users tonight and noticed there are seemingly bots that got in early enough to pretend to be in on the hold, all just to make it even more convincing when they decide to sell. There are also bots offering to pay redditors to post about selling GME, and maybe redditors are taking the bribe even if they aren't selling in true WSB degenerate fashion. Anyways, I think I'm going to get off this sub and hold until this all blows over...",2021-02-10 09:49:24

2nd rule of wallstreetbets is that wallstreetbets is NOT an investment subreddit  


I've been subbed and unsubbed from this subreddit about a thousand times. I've lurked for years. I've posted. I've commented. The number of times that I've seen the term bagholder in the past 6 years I could count on one hand. The number of times I've seen the term bagholder in the past week would rival my loss porn in zimbabwean dollars.  


Wallstreetbets is NOT an investment subreddit. Bagholding is what happens when you make a good investment, get greedy and miss the window of opportunity to cash in your investment. I can't be a bagholder because I wasn't ever investing.  


I'm a gambler. This subreddit is for high risk high reward gambles particularly ones that occur with stocks, options, and trades. If I buy a stock and hold on to it as it falls to the ground, then plunges through the ground, then winds up in Satan's basement it's not because I was bag holding. It's because I made an epic gamble and the gamble lost.  


This subreddit for the longest time has never had gains as it's highest priority. The honor has always been reserved for the highest %change. It's always been about taking risks. And it loves to see a high %loss just as much as a high %gain.  


DFV isn't a hero because he put 13 million dollars into his pocket. He's a fucking hero because he dumped 50,000 into a deep OTM call. For months he lost money. Crazy amounts of money in fact. And you know what, he held. And this subreddit loved to see his losses. He's a hero because he held onto the ball long after most people would have sold.  


But if the 4 million new people on this sub had logged in May of 2020, they'd all be talking about DFV as a ""bagholder"".  


If you use the term bagholder, you don't understand this sub. Go elsewhere. Go to r/investing. Buy an index fund. Collect some dividends and set them up for reinvestment. But don't come here and pretend that you know shit about shit. You don't even know the fucking language, let alone the culture.",2021-02-10 09:30:30

I encourage you to go look at both S3 Partners and Ihor's twitter and see for yourself that they have always been consistent in the format that they report their data.

Ihor's explanation
https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356019385706688512

The above tweets caused a shit storm around S3. People claiming that they were fudging numbers, got a call from Citadel, and that they changed the way they report SI to be sneaky. Here's some additional tweets by both S3 and Ihor (who works at S3) that objectively show that they have always been consistent with how they report short interest. 

Jan 29th S3 reporting float with both SI and S3 SI

Jan 5th Ihor reporting float with both SI and S3I

They have always reported SI % AND SI S3 %. They have always stated that the former is the traditional and the latter is their method which prevents the percentage from being over 100%. These above tweets are just limited to GME. You can browse their tweets over a variety of other stocks and see the same method of reporting. This data is consistent with other sources, it's not like S3 is out there peddling numbers that no one else agrees with.

To consider as a bear thesis.

&#x200B;

1. Every 5-7 years there is a significant correction. Save a quickly recovered Covid crash we're on year 12. 87-91, 91-98, 98-2003, 2003-2008, 2008-Now?
2. Last time PE ratios were this high (2008) they crashed back down. Previous was the dot com bust.
3. Today's Volume was stupidly low, which is concerning.
4. It wouldn't be a stretch to say we're in a mania phase of a bubble.  Look at all the new 'dumb' money pouring in.
5. The economy doesn't ""feel"" healthy, the divide between rich and poor is getting worse, real unemployment is high, no definitive end in sight for the covid-pocolypse.

&#x200B;

Then all the contrary stuff.

1. We're on QE (some fucking high number). The Fed is going Brrr, has been going brrr, and doesn't look like they are gonna stop going brrrr.
2. Along with going Brrr they are keep rates super low, which means there isn't a place to put money other than stonks.
3. Yellen has been fed chair during booms, and doesn't wanna fuck up her rep. She's more concerned with unemployment than inflations, which means she's gonna keep going brrr, and she's Keynseyan AF.
4. Biden et al probably don't want to be seen as responsible for a market crash, and I don't know how much longer they have to let it crash where they can say it's from Trumps policies.
5. Maybe the March covid-crash was enough for the steam to be let off, even though it was temporary AF.

**Edit 1:** As a post mentioned earlier today, Citadel has lied before about their short interest data. There is a small fine of, like, $149,000 for doing so. Paying the fine could save them billions of dollars, so it's possibly that all of the data is completely inaccurate.

**Edit 2:** Stop commenting that it's old data. We were waiting for data for the 29th. The reports are behind. This is the data that came out today, I assure you.

"Disney ($DIS) Earnings (iChing, Horoscope, Tarot)",165,lgh9kw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgh9kw/disney_dis_earnings_iching_horoscope_tarot/,68,1612944521.0,"**$DIS**

Current price (6:32 pm, February 9, 2021): $188.80

IPO price (09:30 am, November 12, 1957): $13.88 ($128.66 in 2021 dollars)

For my first query regarding Disney's stock price, I consulted the iChing - an ancient Chinese divination method that involves flipping 3 coins 6 times in order to form a hexagon based on their results (i.e. heads or tails).

The upper trigram of this query was Gen, while the lower trigram was Kun, giving us the result of 23. According to [divination.com](https://divination.com), this means [""Splitting Apart.](https://divination.com/iching/lookup/23-2/)""

Key takeaways: 

I don't believe we need to take ""Splitting apart"" literally, as in indicating a stock split. The bottom line of the iChing reading indicates the need for patience and bravery, which to me is a bearish signal. We may have to wait longer for parks to open, or earnings may not be as good as expected.

If we are to believe positively in the executive leadership of the Disney Corporation, then the second line indicates a willingness to change. I take this as a signal that they are pivoting to focus on direct to consumer revenue streams such as Disney+.

The third line clearly indicates the announcement of a partnership - or perhaps the ending of one. We will see on Friday.

The fourth line references to the misfortunes Disney has faced in the pandemic, but gives us hope that these times are coming to an end.

The fifth could indicate many different things. I feel that it could either be a positive signal relating to the pandemic coming to a swifter than expected end (positive vaccine news?) or it could indicate a growing dissatisfaction with political and other forces hampering Disney's business model.

The sixth line is absolutely bullish. I expect very positive forward guidance based on the iChing reading.

**Horoscope for Friday, February 11, 2021**

**DISNEY SUN: SCORPIO**

**DISNEY MOON: CANCER**

Data source : [Cafe Astrology](https://cafeastrology.com/scorpio-daily-horoscope-day-after-tomorrow.html)

Key takeaways:

""Today's New Moon occurs when Venus aligns with Jupiter in your solar fourth house, dear Scorpio. It's a beautiful time for feeling warmth or a **feeling of abundance**.""

""It's a time for emphasizing cooperation, trust, and faith.""

""It can also be an excellent time to clear space around the home. Whether you're going bigger or creating the illusion of more space, it feels good. ""

""There can be nice progress on a long-term project.""

""You might enjoy fond memories or activities that focus on comfort and familiarity.""

""You're inclined to make meaningful changes that enhance your current \[...\] arrangements.""

""Avoid acting on impulse, and instead, focus on learning about your true needs.""

To the WSBer reading this, it may seem bullish. But if you happen to be a member of Disney's board, I advise you to look at that last line and make sure that the decisions you are making as a company are good for the company as a whole. Avoid short-sightedness and rushing into things.

Predictions based on the horoscope: Bullish. Partnership. Scaling down parts of the business that are no longer profitable. New project announcement. Something tantalizing about the parks and cruises reopening.

**Tarot**

I only drew one card, the [Upright Magician](https://randomtarotcard.com/TheMagician.jpg).

This is an incredibly bullish card for $DIS. 

""There can be increased financial opportunities available right now, you‚Äôll likely just need to pursue them with gusto. The magician works with many tools to make his will manifest.""

**Random Number \[1,300\]** (courtesy of [Random.org](https://Random.org))

**292**

According to [this website](https://www.sunsigns.org/angel-number-292-meaning/), this number symbolizes getting insight and understanding in order to solve pressing problems. Note that is also in the 97th percentile of possible numbers. I interpret this as bullish on Disney's stock price and forward guidance.

**Conclusion**

Disney is going to blow out earnings and the stock price is going to skyrocket.

The problem is, I had already followed a redditor's advice and had downgraded my account to a cash account days before. I had made sure everything had settled before I initiated the transfer. 

Now, in Robinhood's app, I no longer can find the option to disable instant deposit/margin. It seems they've hidden/buried it further. This is absolutely unacceptable.

Ryan Cohen is at the helm of this dying company. YES its a dying company that's why its a high risk high reward play. Could cohen fail? Yes he could and the company could go bankrupt. Do I think it will happen? Not at all especially with this free marketing.

People were doing amazing DD before your screaming drowned them out. Calling gamestop and finding out some stores are shifting into Gamestops 1.5 focused on building pc's and build a pc kiosks.

If you want to make your money back keep it in GME and talk about the upsides and bring actual conversation to the table. Make your voices heard to gamestop management you want them to involve pc building. I think bundling game pass and a built pc at gamestop is a great way to take share away from steam give it to Microsoft and build some capital for gamestop to utilize.

Give feedback on the app, what is easy and hard to use. Join the powerup Pro rewards program. BUY STUFF FROM GAMESTOP. 

Gamestop has a chance to actually be a 20-40B company if they get a stranglehold on pc parts. they have the ability to beat CyberpowerPC and IbuyPower because they can afford lower margins for prebuilt pc's with their already set up distribution centers. They can open stores in all the areas microcenter doesn't exist. Microcenter does 2.5B in revenue with only 25 stores countrywide. that's insane!

Desktop PC market is 8 Billion yearly revenue. Bro that's a lot of market share they can chip away at. 

Seriously stop looking at SI and making up shit to cope and actually help the company turn around to save your investment.

About that Finra report.,478,lgggb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgggb1/about_that_finra_report/,335,1612942083.0,"Edit: And for everyone wondering, I was in no way implying that ortex, s3, etc. are misreading the fucking data.  My bad for inputting the morningstar link, I was editing the post before posting and changing how I was expressing things and didn't remove it.  It has been removed.
  
I was flat out stating that people HERE are going to look at the finra data and read it wrong, seeing potentially higher concentration of short to volume and also not realizing it's a snapshot at a specific time and long sales the same day could mean that there's more short sales reported than there were short positions created, when all is said and done.  

  
  
Taken directly from https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019  
Found by going to the short interest reporting page here  
https://www.finra.org/filing-reporting/regulatory-filing-systems/short-interest  
and going to notices and clicking on the top one, which is the newest one  
  
I believe everyone here, from what I've seen, is just looking at the number on the report and say OMG LOOK AT THAT SHORT INTEREST!
  
  
The notice from Finra, however, says that is not an accurate way to read the data.  Bolding of key points below is mine.  
  
FINRA believes that the following three key points about the short sale volume data may help market participants better understand and draw informed conclusions about the data. As discussed below, the data: **(1) does not include any trades that are not publicly disseminated, (2) is not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does not‚Äîand is not intended to‚Äîequate to short interest position information.**  
  
  
Keys to Understanding Short Sale Volume Data  
First, as noted above, the data in the Short Sale Files includes only trades that are publicly disseminated and excludes trades that are not publicly disseminated. **As a result, some offsetting buying activity related to reported short selling would not be reflected in the Daily File and may result in the appearance of a higher concentration of short sale to total volume.**  
  
A common example is where a firm is facilitating a customer order to sell long. The firm may elect to first sell an equivalent number of shares from its own trading account to another firm and then purchase the shares from the customer at the same price to fill the outstanding long sale order. Trading in this manner reduces risk for the firm by enabling it to manage its inventory and lock in a price for the customer execution. Although this trading model involves two separate trades‚Äîone between the two firms and one between the firm and its customer‚Äîthe two offsetting trades are executed at the same price to fill a single customer order. Thus, FINRA rules provide for the public dissemination of only one of the trades (the trade between the two firms) so as not to overstate the reported volume.5 If the firm facilitating the customer long sale order has either no position or a short position in the security in its trading account, the trade with the other firm is reported as short and included in the short sale volume calculations in the Daily File. The volume associated with the firm‚Äôs purchase from its customer, however, is not reflected in the Daily File. Thus, the firm‚Äôs short sale is included in the short sale volume calculations without any indication that it is associated with an offsetting purchase to facilitate a customer long sale.  
  
Second, as noted above, the data is published separately by FINRA for each FINRA trade reporting facility and by each exchange, and is not consolidated. **Thus, to obtain a complete picture of short sale volume to total volume in a particular listed stock, market participants must combine data published by FINRA for each of its trade reporting facilities, as well as data published by the exchanges.**6  
  
For example, suppose that for security ABCD, FINRA published a combined short sale volume of 3,000 shares and total volume of 15,000 shares for all of its trade reporting facilities.7 Viewing only this off-exchange data published by FINRA, the percentage of short sale volume to total volume would appear to be 20%. Suppose, however, that there was also activity for ABCD executed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) that day totaling 125,000 shares, of which 12,000 shares were reported as short. This volume is published by NYSE on its website, separate from the volume published by FINRA. When considered together, the overall percentage of short sale volume to total volume for ABCD that day is 10.7%, which is much lower than the data published on the FINRA website would suggest.  
  
FINRA notes that the SEC has a webpage where market participants can find links to the short sale volume data published by FINRA and the exchanges,8 which may facilitate consolidation of the data and provide market participants a more complete picture. However, some exchanges charge a fee for access to their data.9  
  

Finally, **short sale volume data does not‚Äîand is not intended to‚Äîequate to reported bi-monthly short interest information.** FINRA rules require firms to report, on a per security basis, the total quantity of shares held as short positions in all customer and proprietary firm accounts twice a month. FINRA publishes the short interest data for OTC equity securities on its website, while the data for listed stocks is published by the exchange on which the stock is listed. **Although some websites redistribute the Daily File and refer to the data as ‚Äúshort interest,‚Äù it is not, in fact, the equivalent of reported short interest information.**  
  
**Some market participants mistakenly conclude that the bi-monthly short interest data is understated because the Daily File reflects short sale volume that is much larger than what is reported as short interest. However, short interest data reflects short positions held by market participants at a specific moment in time on two discrete days each month, while the Daily File reflects the aggregate volume of trades executed as short sales on each trade date. Therefore, while the two data sets are related (i.e., short sale volume may ultimately result in a reportable short interest position), they are not necessarily correlated.**  
  
For example, if a firm sells short 1,000 shares of security ABCD, then purchases 1,000 shares of ABCD later the same day, the short sale volume in the Daily File will include the 1,000 shares that were sold short. Because the firm sold short and purchased an equivalent number of shares that day, it did not establish or accumulate a short position in ABCD; thus, its short sale has no impact on the reported short interest in ABCD.",2021-02-10 07:28:03

This was more or less confirmed by the NYSE short interest report published today.

As seen [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/iZE8xhq) short interest dropped from 132% to 46% from Jan-15 to Jan-29. (EDIT: short percent of freefloat dropped from 132% to 46%)

I pulled out of GME to stop the bleeding (I know, paper hands). I entered at 321.

Since I have made some money back on GME puts. The short interest report published today is a bearish indicator if you were planning on holding out for short squeeze. I'm sorry to say that a short squeeze is less likely than before. It's unlikely that we will reach the same highs as before unless shorts double down again. We will have to keep an eye on the short interest for the foreseeable future.

For now, bearish sentiment around GME is indicated by the [2.78 put/call ratio](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme).

Anyways, There are many good plays to watch out for: OPEN,  offers to property sellers through an online process, improves and repairs the properties it purchases, and relists them for sale. Markets are changing folks. People want instant demand. OPEN had a nice runup today but within the next 6 months will be wayyyy better. This is a strong hoousing market play that will shake up the industry. Like uber to taxis. Q4 earning on 4-March-2021. Don't sleep on these guys. Holding long with stocks on this one.

&#x200B;

PLTR. Ive been mentioning this one time and time again. I firmly believe in this company. They have a strong leadership team. They are pulling in big contracts and their financials are looking promising. They havent mooned just yet and I am personally invested in this company. However, I am only mentioning this stock for the potential it has. It is a massive analytic software company that can do amazing things. Their software program combines massive data queries into a seamless almost gamelike visual representation easy for the user to comprehend. Yes they had a nice runup recently do to an IBM partnership. I am holding long with stock since it was $18 and i have LEAPS for Jan 2022.

&#x200B;

A more risky stock with the potential for a large runup is CLOV. If you dont know who Chamath is, he is a legend now and someone i highly respect in the financial world given his background, knowledge, and calling out those hedge funds during the GME debacle. CLOV is a healthcare provider play. Now why is this a risky play? Well with Biden as president of the USA, he plans to decrease medicare eligible age from 65 to 60, I know thats huge. Currently, each week, there are 10,000 new people eligible for medicare. those are some massive numbers, numbering billions added in revenue for the industry. Chamath is on of the major reason behind this stock. He is a person focused on growth. He assisted Facebook back in the early 2000s and look where they are now. His backing of CLOV will put them in the spotlight especially if there are positive changes to medicare (especially since offfering medicare plans is their specialty). Chamath walks the walk and talks the talk. But as always do your own research. I personally invested stock in this company. and i look forward to see where this goes.

&#x200B;

Look at the big picture everyone! Stay positive and ask lots of questions.

So now what should you do with this information??

TLDR: OPEN, PLTR, CLOV good stocks. DO YOUR OWN DD

Rolls Royce isn't doing so well. They're losing billions. Their stock is in the dirt, and it looks like people have started picking it up, for dirt cheap.

Some day, the pandemic will fizzle out and air travel will pick up. That will cause the demand for jet engines to pick up, and if RR is still alive by then, their stock should start a recovery.  
If one was to invest in Rolls Royce, this might be the time to yolo in and **hope they don't go bankrupt**. And then wait out the pandemic and hope for their recovery. So basicly, it's a really stupid investment. Unless if it works out, then it's not stupid. If RR survives, they might come out the other end with their fat trimmed, ""lean and mean"".

Or do you have to have a special reopening of the contract and new approval to kind of make that switch?‚Äù

Oshkosh‚Äôs reply: 

> ‚ÄúSo there's limited things that I can say about this program, not because I don't want to, but because we're under a pretty tight confidentiality with the USPS. We don't have to reopen anything to address the needs as they evolve with the contract. I really can't comment on the transit van because of the confidentiality. But I can say that we don't need to go back and have some arduous task of reopening an agreement if the contract goes one way or another, we will not have to do that.‚Äù

In other words, Oshkosh theoretically has no issue with amending their bid for the contract into a bid including all-electric vehicles. Oshkosh, with their powerful connection with Ford, has all the resources they need to win this contract, and their long track record as a successful company protects their stock from plummeting. Workhorse, on the other hand, is a fledgling company with no infrastructure to build a large number of vehicles and a product that is not particularly unique or special.

Let‚Äôs get to the point: the contract will either be decided by end of March or be delayed once again. Either way, WKHS will likely plummet (like it did the last time the contract was delayed). **Buy mountains of WKHS puts expiring in April. Buy OSK shares or, if you‚Äôre brave like me, calls expiring in April.**

The 5-2-3 Strategy: A New Way To Invest,509,lgdlw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgdlw1/the_523_strategy_a_new_way_to_invest/,122,1612933931.0,"For the last few months I‚Äôve been tinkering with and studying a bevy of different TA Indicators for finding stocks to invest in just before the price takes off and selling just before it falls. Well no shit, it‚Äôs something we all try to do. I tried to keep it simple and experimented with EMA and Bollinger Bands.

 One trend that I found over and over again was when I used 5 Day EMA while following the prices day by day.  There were essentially 3 spikes that would happen in the lifespan of a price taking off. First, the 5 EMA would [start by ‚Äúhugging‚Äù the top Bollinger Band](https://imgur.com/axWwcy0) this would be the indicator of one of the three hikes. To confirm this was a real hike and not a dummy, I employed the 2 Day EMA to confirm. In order for it to be confirmed, the 2 Day EMA would need to [break out of the Bollinger Band for roughly 3 trading days](https://imgur.com/bCuJpoh). This was by no means an overall confirmation to invest. The confirmation usually comes 1.5 to 2 months following the first spike when the exact same process happens again. Following the second confirmation we follow the price and make a decision when to jump in just as a dip occurs. We have 100% confidence that a third spike is coming and can ride that into a profit.


Obviously we should not employ this strategy into incredibly volatile stocks but it has been very successful for me thus far. Let‚Äôs take a look at some examples of the 5-2-3 Strategy at work:

&nbsp;

Here is [Netflix in 2015](https://imgur.com/GPPOToX)


Here is [Amazon in 2015](https://imgur.com/zhonAVu)


Here is [NVIDIA in 2017](https://imgur.com/gxdeP9V)


Also some other big investment things that I can't say on this sub have fallen into the 5-2-3 strategy.

&nbsp;

And finally to another recent stock: GME. In late August 2020 [the first spike occurred and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/W3tjDL6), 2.5 months later [the second happened and was confirmed](https://imgur.com/gMyNebx), then the price [took off and probably could‚Äôve topped out at $50-60](https://imgur.com/s4ZY2Lw) but the insanity took hold and the rest is history.

I have 10 left which I'm holding. I got $2,092 out of the 14k I put in.

I don't know if I played the hand they manufactured or if I came to my senses, but I feel relieved. I crunched the numbers and invested in the cruise industry and realised my profits would make up for my loss. As I'm more certain that the cruising industry will rise again more than GME.

Now, if we're being honest with ourselves I put money into GME because I wanted to get rich quick. And then it turned into wanting to ""stick it to the man.""

Well, I read a post on here that swayed me the other way with logic I just couldn't ignore. It was something along the lines of ""if you know you're fighting a battle that's rigged, why not get out and invest in something that has more of a chance?""

That made the most sense to me out of all the other bullshit posts of people trying to get us to sell.

I may have lost 14k, but once the cruise industry gets back in gear and it goes to it's regular value (or higher) then I'll have made 69k in profit (he he). And while I'm not a millionaire, it's still more money than I realistically need and I can always reinvest part of that profit.

Point is, hold if you want, sell if you want. Do what makes you sleep better at night.

Honestly fuck the hedge funds they'll get their karma one of these days. And if it turns out GME goes up, I still have 10 @ 89.98.

The Importance of VWAP (part 2),193,lgbl0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lgbl0i/the_importance_of_vwap_part_2/,64,1612928584.0,"Alright artards, listen up because I'm seeing bullish things.

Last week I wrote a post that looked at the GME chart and various important levels from a volume perspective (and the psychology behind that)....this is a follow up to that post.

Here is that original post:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtvs/volume\_based\_ta/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtvs/volume_based_ta/)

This second post will be short but I just want to highlight one thing. Take a look at this chart below (or your own) and notice how ever since that faithful day when 5m idiots got boned by Robinhood, price has not closed above VWAP (in this chart normal VWAP is orange and white line is anchored VWAP from the top)

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/eM7wzfj4/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/eM7wzfj4/)

For those that don't know what VWAP is go google it, but in short, it's basically a volume weighted moving average that holds a lot of weight for traders and is an indication of where the balance of power lies within a market trend. As I mentioned, price has failed to close above VWAP since the major high two weeks ago. This is an interesting place for the chart right now because it is fighting with the pretty important $50 level. Why is $50 important? I think it's important because most of you idiots got into this trade above $50 meaning that we might have hit max pain on this trade as everyone is in the red. We will just have to wait and see...

**TLDR: If we hold $50 and finally manage to close above VWAP (today or tomorrow), then the odds tip in our favor for the party to start again. I'm not necessarily convinced that we are going to see this go over $500 but I think we will see a significant bounce and make a lower high relative to the last peak two weeks ago (say, $150/$200 range). Also, major bullish bonus points if we break above the red downtrend line and hold it as support.**

This is not financial advice. Make your own decisions based on your own assessment....i'm just trying to educate people on some TA concepts. I took a 40 share intraday position this morning at $47.80 and I plan to swing it through the night if we close above VWAP. If we fail to take VWAP I will be flat at the close.

&#x200B;

Update: Just made a convincing move above VWAP on big volume. Its about to retest back into it and if it holds thats good.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hyDyQ7VX/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/hyDyQ7VX/)

Update: and it failed below. I got stopped out on 30 shares already and unless something miraculous happens into the close I will flatten on the final 10.

Final update on the day:

Ok folks, todays close was really interesting. Take a look at the chart below. About 1 hour before close we were above VWAP and then broke under with about 45 minutes left on the day. Then about 15 min before close we started to climb back up into VWAP but rejected. At that point I closed the rest of my position. LITERALLY at the final 30 seconds of the day we spiked above VWAP and closed above. To me this looked more like a weird liquidity quark rather than a convincing trend change but then the after hours action started and wow...this might get interesting tomorrow. Price just broke the downtrend (red line) and is currently testing as support. I put less weight on this price action as its happening after hours but if it holds that trend and holds VWAP in the first 15 minutes tomorrow then I think we see a big green morning.

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/afcjW5FW/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/afcjW5FW/)

&#x200B;

Back again:

I just want to note that IMO this is the best risk/reward entry point for GME right now. GME closed above VWAP yesterday for the first time since the major peak (granted a bit of a weird close but still got it), then broke, tested, and resumed off of the downtrend support. Then, it fell through VWAP in the AM, held the low of yesterday, and then recovered in a big way. Now it's retesting back down at VWAP (as to be expected). Personally I'm adding here.

I want to caution my fellow autists from reading too much into this single piece of data. Let‚Äôs start with what we know about tonight‚Äôs report:

1) This report is based on self reported data. 

2) The fine for misreporting, if caught, is pennies on the dollar compared to the costs to cover.

3) The data report covers up until the 29th.

So what are the possible outcomes:

1) Data is accurate, HF covered: I believe at this point GME becomes a long play. There is the potential for an acquisition or a turn around/pivot in the business model. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.

2) Data is accurate, HF did not cover: I believe the play here would be to buy as much as you can. This would push up the price pushing more expiring calls ITM and put further pressure on the HF. We would likely get a significant influx of new investment interest from retail and the squeeze is on. The play is buy and hold.

3) Data is inaccurate: This is the most likely outcome given the money at stake. If it shows they haven‚Äôt covered then there would be no real sense in putting out false data. If it shows they have covered then it becomes a gut call. Personally, the continued bots and media coverage seem to still indicate that something is amiss otherwise why go through all that effort, expense, etc. The play is buy (DCA) and hold.

In all three scenarios buy and hold seems to be the most prudent course of action. The only reason to sell IMHO is if you believe GME will go bankrupt. 

Ok so I‚Äôm going to buy if I can or continue to hold ... what could happen that would turn this around?

1) If not covered, a whale investor or fund deciding to purchase this serving as a catalyst for a true squeeze. Elon, Cuban, another HF, etc. Personally,I have my Tesla in my shopping cart already.

2) If not covered, GME reverse stock split. This could force a true squeeze though likely would not happen until the stock gets back into single digits.

3) If not covered, emergency shareholder meeting. My understanding this would cause a recalling of shares to allow the shareholders to vote, this initiating the squeeze.

4) If covered or uncovered, significant renewed public interest in GME. A lot more likely if uncovered, but it‚Äôs a strange world we live in so I wouldn‚Äôt completely rule it out if they covered.

5) If covered or uncovered, GME public offering of 10 million shares at $x price (we will say $200). This sets a bottom for the stock in the short term, I believe most who are already in the stock would see value in putting billions into the company coffers either for stock support on a cash balance basis or to be a war chest to facilitate the turn around. I am actually a bit puzzled why this hasn‚Äôt already been done.

6) If covered, GME being acquired by a major player at a reasonable price. This would ensure continuing good will from the existing shareholders and would ensure the GameStop name lives on.

7) If covered, GME makes a strategic purchase or alliance that then starts to justify a higher evaluation.

Obviously these are the thoughts of some retarded ape. Full disclosure, I am currently down around 100k in my positions on GME. In my mind, the invested funds were completely lost at the moment of purchase so it doesn‚Äôt bother me to hold forever or until I win, whichever comes first. ü¶çüôåüíéüöÄüåï

 Payday 3 is going to be develeoped and released in 2023, is this too early to talk about it, is it apeshit to bet on a game for profits? 

Price is in krons so market cap is around 140million USD and it was around 50 million USD when raid happened. 

These guys saw they need new engine and they are going on Unreal Engine, i believe it is a great potential, they made the whole payday from stripped down racing engine. 

There has been heads changing in last years and last DLC's on payday2 were the most successful. Company is not profiting yet their share price rose with the success of DLC's, it was 0.5 kron at police raid, 1 kron after things settled down and now pushing high 1.5's. This is %300 with making positive annoucements and a damn DLC.   


What you think, does it make sense to bet on a game? Also for their genre i can only see GTA's heists close and GTA 6 does not seem to be releasing soon. Also for 2 year period, this is not an AAA game but a game that lives with addons, will it be short? Can it suck because it will be underdeveloped?

"Say it with me...R G B. If you are too busy crying about lost tendies and not looking at the $CRSR discount today, you don't deserve money",403,lga6ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lga6ua/say_it_with_mer_g_b_if_you_are_too_busy_crying/,177,1612924994.0,"So you could continue to moan and lick your wounds that you didn't become a millionare in 3 days, or you can sack up and make your money back on a surefire play.

Today $CRSR earnings released. The numbers were killer as they have been all year (I'm not going to dive into deep DD on the earnings report itself as other posts have already done),. Future guidance is conservative but still very bullish. 

This stock has everything going for it, yet the price tanked. 

**Why?**

Because its 2021 and every stock is doing the same thing post positive earnings. 

Check out [LOGI](https://imgur.com/D0FoKHV)....earnings call on 1/18, dipped for a day, bounced back to ATH 2 weeks later and climbing fast. 

CRSR is currently at the bottom of that curve right now.

Was it an IV crush? Honestly this morning it was more like a bunch of short-selling in expectations of an IV crush followed by a bunch of panicky paper hands.  It's already up 5% on the day's lows

Every $CRSR financial metric is extremely positive, huge gains over last year.

""But but but /u/dontmicrowavecats , are you sniffing glue? The price of CRSR already rose from $36 to $46, the earnings was already priced in. There will be no moon for you.""

No, wrong. Why? Because the price was only at $36 due to pressure from the GME squeeze.

**Citadel owns 2% of the $CRSR Float. On 1/13, the same day GME rose 57% for the first time, CRSR tanked. CRSR was oversold in direct reaction to GME**
https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CRSR/holders?p=CRSR

So the price tanks from $41ish to $36, starts recovering, then CRSR issues a secondary PO for 7.5 million shares...price drops again. 

The stock is currently BARELY trading above the previous averages right now. The entire ""runup"" to ER wasn't a runup at all, but rather an upward price correction to where it should be.

The stock is still undervalued, and currently trading at a big discount. Today and *possibly* tomorrow will be the best day to buy CRSR you will get.

We are likely going to see $60 within 2 weeks, $70+ soon after that.

Hey retards, we are so close to seeing this GME & AMC thing through.

Today there is a very important report coming which will let us know updated numbers on the number of shorts that major hedge funds still have.

**This report will most likely be artificially skewed in an attempt to shake out the rest of the long-term SS holders.**

***How can the report be skewed?*** Say you have 1000 shares in short positions in a company that only has 1000 shares available. That means that your hedge fund has a 100% short interest in that company. Say, some random trove of wandering monkeys notice that your hedge fund has 100% short interest in that company, and you and your billionaire friends are all spooked because there aren't enough shares for those monkeys to buy (the short squeeze narrative). What do you do?

You somehow have to amass enough shares to drive that short interest percent down, because you want to appear that you've closed your short positions and scare the monkeys away. So this is what you do. You buy 800 shares in long positions (using call options), and suddenly the short interest is only 20%. You have made it appear that your hedge fund is no longer unreasonably short on that stonk.

&#x200B;

**HOWEVER, YOU HAVE STILL NOT CLOSED YOUR SHORT POSITION!** You still have to buy back all of those shorted stocks, and you've effectively thrown a rug over the giant shit stain in the middle of the room. It's worth it for you to do this though, because the monkeys who are expecting a moon will paper-hand and stop the short squeeze from being as severe.

&#x200B;

What does this mean? Hold, despite what the report says. If the report shows high SI, then the hedgies are actually 100% boned and have not even had enough time and/or money to offset that SI number. That's huge. If the report shows low SI, HODL. The big players simply have not had enough volume to cover all their short positions, and are trying to manipulate us into thinking the MOASS was a hoax.

Some DD on TLRY/APHA since none of you seem to get it,1191,lg9ktu,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg9ktu/some_dd_on_tlryapha_since_none_of_you_seem_to_get/,411,1612923415.0,"All prices listed in USD. Using the US tickers. Holding 500 shares of APHA, not giving advice just putting out details.

Prices at time of writing:

* **TLRY** - 42.39

* **APHA** - 23.19


**Background:** Tilray (TLRY) and Aphria (APHA) are two companies based in Canada that sell marijuana. A few years ago both of these companies went to the moon, especially TLRY which reached $300 a share before crashing back down. 


**Current Catalysts**

*Merger:* Recently they announced a merger, set to finalize this year. The combined company will trade under the TLRY name and ticker, but APHA is acquiring TLRY. Those holding APHA will get ~0.84 shares of the new company (TLRY) for each APHA share they hold.

*Arbitrage gap:* Both companies have skyrocketed since announcing the merger, boosted by other news such as the Dem majority, Biden's election, and opening new deals in the UK. Oddly, TLRY has outpaced APHA, leading to a massive gap in share price. At the 0.84 share conversion APHA shares should be currently trading at $35.60. 

*Market share/Cap:* The combined TLRY/APHA will be the largest weedstock in the world by sales, with one of the highest margins as well. However, they are currently undervalued compared to CGC, the largest weedstock by market cap, by about 5 billion dollars, or ~50% of their current market cap. You may remember CGC was awarded a 5 billion dollar investment a few years back by Constellation Brands.

**Future Catalysts**

* Merger - Not finalized, but very likely to be finalized soon

* Partnership - Likely, as they will be the largest company and have the largest global footprint. Who the partner will be is unknown, but it is likely that they get one

* US Legalization - Dems could hold this up, but all signs point to reform coming

* US Banking reform - This will allow all sorts of money to flow into the sector that is current prohibited because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level

**Stupid Questions I keep seeing**

* No, this isn't like last time. When TLRY went to $300 it was shorted 33%. It is currently shorted 50% and has actual catalysts and sales behind it now

* The price looks different on Canadian tickers because they trade in Canadian dollars. It is still the same company

* If you own APHA, when the merger comes you will get 0.84 TLRY shares for each APHA share. It is that simple. If it isn't an even number you get some cash back. If you own calls, the calls will be bundles of 84 shares instead of 100. Seriously, this isn't hard math

* Yes they can still run, they are undervalued compared to CGC and the US market is bigger than Canada, UK, and Germany combined.

* Yes they can still drop. If I knew for certain it was going up I'd have more than 500 shares and be much less poor

* TLRY could drop to close the gap, or APHA could rise. No one knows which will happen. APHA is likely the safer play at this point, as it is cushioned by the gap in share price.

The End of the Telcos,22,lg9dup,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg9dup/the_end_of_the_telcos/,100,1612922932.0,"Everyone take a look at the following stonks:  
Verizon, Centurylink, AT&T, Frontier Communications

None have increased in price since 1999. Only Verizon is near its peak in 99; AT&T is half the price it was then. Centurylink is 1/5th the price. Frontier is 1/500th the price.

All of these companies have something in common: They all own Bell's old wireline assets. And they've done nothing with them. For the twenty five years or so they've held them.

These companies are, collectively, the biggest service providers for rural ""broadband"" (it's an oxymoron) in the United States. They are also all reporting dwindling landline subscribers year over year, due in large part to the poor service and poor price point for a service that no longer works as well as it once did, due to crumbling copper infrastructure and failed (and/or refusal to commit to) fiber replacement.

Verizon and AT&T have both offered very substantial dividends for years (and received hundreds of billions in taxpayer subsidy) as opposed to reinvesting those billions of dollars into necessary upgrades to infrastructure and maintenance. They have also reported consistent layoffs of technical personnel in every passing year. I suspect Centurylink and Frontier have reported the same. Great way to pad balance sheets in failing companies!

Now, Verizon and AT&T both own wireless systems; Verizon being the self-proclaimed 'largest nationwide provider.' But there's a problem here for both of them. T-Mobile is blowing them out of the water in urban areas with faster speeds and truly unlimited data, and in rural areas, where they have a stranglehold, the ROI is not very good. To make matters worse, competitors like Starlink, and later, OneWeb and Project Kuiper, are coming online and the telcos are not prepared to compete against them in their rural regions.

The fact that both AT&T and Verizon attempted (and more or less failed) to move into the media sphere with acquisitions over the years seems to imply they weren't very interested in staying telecommunications companies. In fact, I believe their goal, long term - and there are articles supporting this out there - was to let the old ATM/copper network rot completely, and become solely wireless companies. No more unlimited data landlines, no more telephone subscribers. That's a much bigger chunk of their current revenue than people may realize.

If these companies keep losing ground in urban areas, they will face insurmountable monetary challenges in the next decade due largely in part to their own hubris. They figured wireless would be the solution to everything, but as it turns out, if you don't run fiber to the farmland, wireless might as well be dial-up.

**tl;dr** The telcos are quickly running out of time and resources to make up for their mistakes over the last twenty years. If they don't act soon, it will be lights out.",2021-02-10 02:08:52

There's a little thing called opportunity cost. Selling at a loss sucks, but it can be the profitable move. If you hold a stock because it's at a loss until it hits X in Y months you will likely have less money than if you sell now, re-invest it and hit 30% on whatever you know is going up (weed, TESLA, renewables, online gambling, pretty much anything except treasuries right now).

How to go from a Virgin GME Ape into a Chad GME Investor on WSB,508,lg8qhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg8qhg/how_to_go_from_a_virgin_gme_ape_into_a_chad_gme/,94,1612921305.0,"GME gang, we've got an image issue, and I've come to realize that while GME may be a good investment depending on what DD you choose to listen to, *you* are the biggest problem GME has.

Are there bots and shills here? Undoubtedly there were, maybe there even still is. At most I think 10% of the participants are/were bots or hired trolls. But what those guys do most is amplify the worst we have to offer on either side of this stock to set the tone. After that ball is in motion the shills and bots and trolls could walk away and we'd keep burning for weeks.

Consider this a social short squeeze. A bunch of newcomers here and give OGs short fuses. Then some outside actors come in and applies leverage to the friction between new and old users. Finally, OGs will squeeze GME holders into becoming social pariahs. And before you know it your own private portfolio has become a badge of shame. Regardless of everything else, *this* squeeze I'm describing *has* squoze.

So what can we do to get back into the good graces of our gracious, yet strained hosts? 

* Stop being a dork.  
* Stop clogging the sub with low-effort bullshit
* Stop flexing, 
* Stop acting like a junkie, e.g. ""YoU HoLdInG?""
* Stop using the wrong fucking flair, (for fucks sake it's not hard!)

And here's what you can start doing instead:

* Learn what other people are interested in
* Listen in on other DDs for other tickers
* Participate in discussions outside of GME, broaden your horizons
* Laugh at your own stupid mistakes
* Step outside of the GME threads and into others. Integrate with the community

Listen, hold your GME if that's what you want to do. Only you know your current situation and risk tolerances. I'm still holding, but I'm diversifying, and I'll be putting some of my gains from other investments into GME to lower my cost average. 

I don't think anyone here really wants you to sell GME. Instead, I think they want you to shut the fuck up about it. At least for now, while it's doing nothing of real interest.

Read and write your own GME DD based on numbers instead of vitriol. If and when GME flies again, be cool about it. Be quiet about it. And post the biggest fucking gains this sub has ever seen. 

Mods, I think we can get rid of the GME daily threads for a while. They currently only attract trolls and weak minded people who need constant reinforcement. I think it's time GME gang learns to stand on the merits of their own investments instead of huddling around each other like penguins in the long dark antarctic winters.

DoorDash is about to collapse, and this is your opportunity to bank.",407,lg8hl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg8hl5/i_believe_i_have_found_lotto_fds_and_other_puts/,232,1612920673.0,"*Disclaimer: It is moronic to buy FDs. That is not the way to consistently build wealth. The very reason FDs pay off such huge returns is because on average their probability of expiring worthless is 99%. If you‚Äôre moronic enough to buy FDs with me, only do it with money that you are willing to literally set on fire. Actual fire. There are plenty of safer puts on DASH that will pay obscene returns this year.*.   
    
**TLDR: I believe DoorDash (DASH) is the greatest short opportunity of the year, and what‚Äôs more, rather than just having a general feeling, there are specific timetables enabling us to profit bigly. The company even admits themselves that they have peaked as a company.**    
    
# Analysis:
    
>‚ÄúFood delivery with third-party apps like Grubhub and Uber Eats is booming, but no one's making money.‚Äù ‚Äì Business Insider.    
    
DoorDash is wildly overvalued. This is true by any metric, were it in essentially any industry. Add to that its in food delivery, which is a horrific, no margin industry in what has become a commoditized business and offers essentially no differentiation with its competitors.  There is near zero differentiation between Uber Eats, Postmates, Caviar, Grubhub, DASH, or any local provider. In Austin we have Favor, for example. And nobody cares which company delivers their food, they only care which one does it cheapest.     
    
If you view stock (as you should) as buying the entire business as an owner, how much would you be willing to pay for an undifferentiated company in a no margin commoditized business that has peaked (see below for more on that)? Because it‚Äôs currently selling for an insane $56 billion. Outrageous.    
    
So how can we get a banana for scale to understand what that $56 billion means in terms of valuation?    
    
Well, all of DoorDash‚Äôs competitors have either sold at or are trading at, or raised money at, a capitalization of 3x to 6x sales. **DASH is trading at an absolutely insane 20+ x sales.**    
    
Just six months ago [Postmates was acquired for $2.65 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/06/uber-takes-out-postmates) which put it at 4x sales. **At 4x sales, DASH would trade at $32.**    
    
DASH used to be the business leader in this industry, but over the past 2-3 years Grubhub has exploded in size to take on nearly the same 33% of market share, and after Uber Eats bought Postmates, it too now has about a third of market share. So you now have three giants of roughly equal size battling it out in a business in which customers don‚Äôt give a motherloving frick about branding.    
    
### But don‚Äôt take my word for it on valuation, take smart money‚Äôs word    
    
[DoorDash raised money just a couple months ago at a $16 billion valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/18/after-ipo-delays-doordash-confirms-400m-raise/#:%7E:text=DoorDash%20has%20confirmed%20that%20it,money%20valuation%20of%20%2416%20billion). That is truly a stunning fact. In just a few months the WSB type day trading call buyers have bid this company all the way up to $56 billion from $16 billion without any material change to the business and completely ignoring the coming vaccine-induced reopening of restaurants. Again, the stock trades for a 300% markup to its recent smart money capital raise based on nothing but unfounded hopium.     
    
You don‚Äôt have to take my word for it, your beloved Jim Cramer has even said the same thing, in his own idiotic, covering my ass, round about say nothing way. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs true that people using market orders took DoorDash to levels that maybe ... were far higher than they thought they‚Äôd have paid.‚Äù - Jim Cramer    
    
I don‚Äôt care about his commentary, but you people seem to love him, so there you go. üòò      
    
## The Company, according to The Company, has peaked. It‚Äôs over.     
    
There are two extremely interesting things buried in the S-1 we‚Äôre going to get into in a moment. One of them is that you don‚Äôt have to take my word for it that this company‚Äôs business has peaked. **The company says so itself in its own S-1.**   
      
>The circumstances that have accelerated the increase in Total Orders stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may not continue in the future, and we expect the growth rate in Total Orders to decline in future periods.    
    
To put it simply, COVID numbers are falling, vaccines are rolling out at an impressive 1-2 million per day which puts our stated goal of 100 million vaccinated in 100 days within attainable reach. The economy will be opening up, people will want to be getting out of the house, restaurants will be reopening, and there will be huge pent up demand by people who have had extraordinarily high savings rates over the last year. Big chains will no longer have the need to get help from third party delivery apps at a 15% markup. We all know this is the case, and DoorDash even stated as much in its own filing. This stock is toast.    
    
 >‚ÄùDelivery via smartphone is one of those venture-funded sectors where business executives appear to have taken seriously the old joke about ‚Äúlosing money on every transaction but making it up on volume.‚Äù ‚Äì New York Magazine    
    
[‚ÄúDoorDash and Grubhub and Uber Eats... it‚Äôs a tough business for them. It‚Äôs very competitive. I think the business model is hard.‚Äù - Panera Bread CEO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzQJdBHo3tw).    
    
## And Now the Fun Part     
    
There are some wild share lockup expirations coming up. For those that don‚Äôt know, when you get these massive IPOs, insiders aren‚Äôt actually able to sell their shares on IPO day. They are locked up and the insiders just have to hope for the best that the stock will not lose value over the coming months. If the stock skyrockets in value, but the insiders know the business is trash or has peaked, you get the perfect recipe for a rush for the exits.     
    
I love playing share lockups. I make a lot of money on them by selling spreads. A common question I get when I post them here is ‚Äúif you know a drop is coming, why doesn‚Äôt the market just price it in?‚Äù The answer is because it can‚Äôt. No matter what the share price does, the lockup expiration date is the lockup expiration date. Insiders have to wait until that date, and it doesn‚Äôt matter whether the stock falls 0%, 5%, or 50%, they will all have to wait until that day to sell.     
    
DoorDash has two share lockup expirations coming.     
    
The first lockup expiration is an early release (heh) and hits 90 days after the Dec. 9 IPO, or around March 9, as long as the stock trades 25% higher than the IPO price for five out of 10 consecutive days of trading.  That is to say, so long as DASH trades above $127.50 right before March 9, the lockup is triggered. The good news for you with this insane run up in price is that if the lockup isn‚Äôt triggered, it means the stock has already fallen from $190 to $127. It‚Äôs important to know March 9 is not a hard date exactly...some insiders can be allowed to go a few days prior. Also if they release earnings early the lockup could potentially occur at the end of this month.    
    
I was talking to some folks on WSB about the lockup last week, and someone mentioned they thought only 20% of insider shares will be eligible. DoorDash's management and board members can sell up to 20% of their shares in that first wave, but other insiders can sell up to 40%. This means 113 million shares are eligible for sale in early lockup expiration. DoorDash‚Äôs daily volume is only 3-4 million shares. The current public float is roughly 123 million shares. This means you‚Äôre about to suddenly double the number of shares on the market.     
    
Door Dash‚Äôs second lock-up expiration hits either 180 days after its IPO, which means around June 9 (more or less), or after the release of its first-quarter earnings report (whichever is earlier), and will free up ‚Äúall remaining shares‚Äù according to the S-1, which if my math is correct is roughly 50 million shares.     
    
These two expirations could spark violent sell-offs throughout the year.    
    
## Positions     
    
### FDs
        
I never buy FDs. I‚Äôve never once bought them in my entire life. But I‚Äôm putting 1% of my portfolio into them on DASH because I‚Äôm confident big drops are coming. Unfortunately for you guys, the stock has already started falling this past month from its ü§°-level highs in the $200s, and worse yet the pricing/IV of all options has gotten more expensive. This means, I‚Äôm sorry to say, that you‚Äôre not going to find any options trading for pennies, or even anything less than $2. For your FDs, I recommend you buy puts at whatever the lowest strikes are that actually have any volume. The strikes go as low as $75, but most days show 0 volume and of course the bid/ask spread is enormous. There has been some volume at $95 recently, and you can get the $75s if you‚Äôre patient enough and willing to pay up for them. Expiration dates would be any time in mid to late March (again, looking for whatever has volume) so that it occurs after lockup 1, and the August 20s, which unfortunately are the closest expiration to the lockup occurring around June 9. I wish there was a closer expiration, but hey, more time for the stock to collapse. Plus you could always sell your puts after the June 9 drop with lots of theta meat still left on the bone.     
    
### Puts
I own March 12 $160 puts. I think the stock will drop healthily below this, but IV is high. I‚Äôm normally taking big swings with spreads, so when I buy puts outright, which is rare, I want to play it a little safer.    
    
I also own the August 20 $145 puts.     
    
And finally, I have six figure credit call spreads open at the $175 level. For newbies, this simply means I:    
Bought (yes bought) the March 12 $175 calls, and     
Sold the $172.50 calls.    
    
I went huge on these because all I need is for DoorDash to trade below $172.50 after the lockup expiration and I‚Äôll be having a Merry Christmas. That‚Äôs as close to risk free gains as you‚Äôre ever going to see in your life.    
    
### Bull case    
The only bull case is that we‚Äôre in a raging, record-setting bull market and all stonks go up. The economy is opening back up, vaccines are rolling out, and stonks go up. But I think if you look at the DASH chart you can see that that is already starting to not be the case.    
    
### What are the negatives?    
I plagiarized liberally [from an old Citron Research report](https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/DoorDash-The-Most-Ridiculous-IPO.pdf), although it doesn‚Äôt even mention share lockups. Yes, that Citron. For those of you who are newer members, I will tell you this; the little smart money social circles in and around WSB do not hate CItron, Hindenburg, or any other short selling firms. We respect them and welcome bearish cases on high flying stocks. Any intelligent trader does. It‚Äôs only the pump and dumpers who have a hatred for short reports. You should welcome contrarian views.    
    
### Parting Words.   
I would welcome anyone pointing out where they think I may be wrong. I don‚Äôt care about saving face, I care about not losing money. If I‚Äôm wrong, I want to know it. I welcome constructive criticism.    

## Give Me One More TLDR At The End    
This stock is going to collapse because it‚Äôs wildly overvalued, employees got in super cheap with shares they are waiting to sell, know the business has peaked, and they want to cash the fahk out. So swallow the high IV and buy puts today as fast as you can.     
    
Love you guys.",2021-02-10 01:31:13

Just before it does come out I wanted to check that people understand what it is reporting.

The Settlement date of a stock is T+2, basically 3 business days.

So Just so everyone understands, that means the only thing you'll see is trading up to January 27th.

So up to that moment it had not actually hit the highest point, which occurred on the 28th, and for many firms they'd only receive their margin call after the close of the 27th, not during the day.  

So I'm just putting that out there, control your expectations and think ahead about what you expect to hear before it comes out 'cause i think emotional thinking will overwhelm some people at that point.

It is extremely likely you will still see a very high short interest, likely still over 100%, possibly even higher than 140%.So please be aware that this is BEFORE the price maxed, that a large percentage of those companies will have had to close their positions the very next day when the stock tripled in value, but that will not be reflected here.The specific hedge funds everyone is completely obsessed with also claimed to close their positions after Wednesday. This report is as of Tuesday, you will not be able to use it to confirm a conspiracy theory that they lied.

So do with the information what you will, I still expect some people to weave it into conspiracy theories, but at least know what the information in terms of the dates it covers.

EDIT: This applies obviously to the other stocks too. If you still really look forward to the report go read the old ones at FINRA so at least you understand what you're going to be getting

Interesting options activity: hitting the highest strikes in a very big way,43,lg6om2,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg6om2/interesting_options_activity_hitting_the_highest/,25,1612915953.0,"You can take a look at the ticker on your own. 

Disclaimer: very high IVs on everything on the option chain. This was one of the memestonks from the GME era, which drew down very quickly. For those interested, short % of float is around 33% so this is not going to be a GME squeeze. 

Not going to talk about politics either because yes that is a major factor. You can go to plenty of other boards to see when Kamala will make the special agriculture ~~mandatory~~ legal. There are much better other stocks within this green ecosystem, but don't show this kind of massive inflow into the highest strikes (so lots of pent up demand, which in turn should drive the delta and gamma higher). 

So here it is. For the non-YOLO July 2021 and Jan 2022, the $4 strike (33% higher than the $3 which is a big jump) is getting around 5-6x of the volume today. Similarly on the OI, there's a lot of people buying. 

Yes, once higher strikes on chain are introduced, there might be a drop in interest in the $3 and $4. However, that's not to say there will be even more demand for the cheaper $5s and higher strikes, once again driving the gamma machine.

Currently down 72.55%, still hanging on. AMC has mitigated bankruptcy so I‚Äôll make it back sooner or later, but not gonna lie having diamond hands is rough some days. I dedicated a pretty small portion of my portfolio to AMC/GME and am still holding. Dumped in $2.7k sitting at a whopping $730 as of writing this. We get new short interest numbers today after market close, if this is still above 80% I believe we‚Äôll see a rebound. So I‚Äôll keep holding

Position: 107 shares & 15 AMC $20c 2/26 contracts. And 45 GME @ $80.12 avg, holding out there too

Glad ur starting to realize how movie theaters work. But people keep paying for that overpriced popcorn and sit in those seats. This is not financial advice but, if people miss that stale popcorn and overpriced candy (candy the real cash cow here) once C*vid is over, maybe it‚Äôll go back up. And the more bag holders there are, and the more hedges short, the higher likelihood we see a short squeeze in the future. Maybe.

Being an IT person, their products are best in class and rock solid. They also sell routers & switches as well as a ticketing platform for IT departments/companies. When they first launched their IPO a few months ago, I bought some shares and have been following them since. Their network equipment reminds me of Cisco Meraki, just at the very beginning of their launch(I did the same w/ Ubiquiti $UI, and have rode it from $55 to $350/share).

They are about to release their 2nd earnings report on 3/11. This is where I found a pretty good options play. Share price is roughly $24.87-$25 right now, and the 3/19 call options at $22.50 is trading around $4. This means the stock only has to rise to $26.50 or $1.63 during their earnings report timeframe to win on this. Given this is their 2nd earnings release(their first one was right around their IPO, so it was pretty buried), if they have good news, this could be a big winner. I believe the $20 call options may have an even smaller gap to cross, likely closer to $25.75, or $1.10.

&#x200B;

The bonus is that their equipment is generally sold in contracts, so the likelihood of them having a poor quarter is minimal. I have bought call options and own shares. Not financial advice, I just like the stonk.

One day a very clever fish convinced a bunch of retarded fish to buy tickets for this meal and hold on to them which increased the price exponentially. The retarded fish could then sell the tickets back to the Snakes making a profit. 

Soon enough all the other fish in the sea heard about this Game and came to help. But by then it was too late, the price of a meal ticket was more than any little fish could afford.

The Snakes seeing this plan had succeeded in almost bankrupting them did a cunty spineless move and sold tickets between themselves to make the price of a ticket go down, so the retarded fish couldn‚Äôt put them out of business.

The retarded fish were obstinate and they continued to hold onto their meal tickets despite the price going down. ever so slowly, ever so painfully as many of the fish who got in late lost money and sold off their tickets. 

Some retarded fish thought they could make the price go up again by buying more but this was ineffectual as the activity of the Snakes was too much and more and more fish each day were giving up and selling their tickets to make some cash back and feed their fishwives and retarded fish children.

Silly fish thought a smart snail watching from the sidelines, if only the retarded fish could see that if they stopped buying more tickets and let the big fish who bought lots of tickets sell one at a time, the price would lower so more fish could buy even more tickets. Eventually the Snakes wouldn‚Äôt have any tickets to sell between themselves.   

The smart snail offered to help the retarded fish defeat the Snakes by delivering a clever strategy for success. ‚ÄúGo away crazy snail, that would never work,‚Äù said the retarded fish. ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want the Snakes out of business we just want to buy tickets.‚Äù Stupid retard fish they thought the game was only about buying and holding tickets.

If only the retarded fish would stop sending each other memes and sucking each other‚Äôs dicks all day they might actually take over the Big Meal Business, if only they could see that it was them who had all the numbers they needed to swarm the Snakes and take all the tickets from them and their would be nothing the Snakes could do about it in time.

Poor Retarded Fish, thought the smart snail, guess they‚Äôll never learn, I guess now they‚Äôll always be Poor Retarded Fish. (sigh)

&#x200B;

**My Own Thoughts (my own opinion and not financial advice)**

**-** I believe this was a blowout quarter. Taking a look at page 42 of the 8-K filing, we can see that Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 83% in 2020 year-over-year to $539 million. In Q4 2020 alone, Gamer and Creator Peripherals revenue grew 104% year-over-year to $192 million. Overall revenue in 2020 grew 55% year-over-year to $1.702 billion, while in Q4 alone revenue grew by 70% year-over-year to $556 million.

\- There were expansions of gross margin in both segments (gamer and creator peripherals, and gaming components and systems). Gamer and creator peripherals gross margin has expanded to 35% from 31% in 2018, while gaming components and systems gross margin has expanded to 24% from 17% in 2018. **The fact that gross margin in the components and systems segment improved by 700 bps during that time period in a market that has notoriously low margins tells me that the marketing of Corsair‚Äôs products as premium quality, is working and that customers are choosing the higher priced items over lower priced competitor items.** Corsair was also able to expand margin by engaging in less promotional activities which means that consumers most definitely choosing Corsair‚Äôs higher priced products over lower-cost competitors due to a variety of reasons such as build quality and brand loyalty. 

\- I was extremely impressed with the improvement of the Gamer and Creator Peripherals gross profit by 133% year-over-year, which it seems was led by their Elgato streaming products for streamers and content creators. The margins are much higher in this area than in components and streamer customers seem to regard Elgato products with high enthusiasm.

\- Adjusted EBITDA tripled in 2020 to $213 million which it seems can be attributed to an explosion of demand for Corsair‚Äôs products by customers who are spending more time at home working and gaming.",2021-02-09 23:38:14

Aphria/Tilray Merger,1033,lg5lq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5lq3/aphriatilray_merger/,404,1612913032.0,"Second time posting this. Made it last night but other than a collab between CGC and APHA, news about the merger seems to be the same this morning.

This is my first DD so please bare with me in case I set something up wrong; I'm happy to edit if so but this took me a while to gather.

I just joined this sub about two weeks ago amidst the GME hype. I've been investing for a few years now ever since the Tilray IPO at $17. Bought, sold, and reinvested consistently (pulling out my principal each time) right up through the almost $300 peak and backed out. I left Tilray alone for a while until recently when the news regarding the merger with Aphria started popping up because I actually love Aphria and I've owned it for a while now, so I wanted to post some DD regarding the merger. Hope this helps some of you.

**For the business:** Reverse merger is taking place where Aphria is absorbing Tilray and will own 63% of the company, continuing to use the name Tilray due to better brand recognition and its nearly eponymous representation of the cannabis market. Aphria has a strong presence in Germany which is the only European country with medical marijuana, so Aphria has an advantage in that sector for if/when other European nations start following suit. With both Aphria's and Tilray's international relations along with slowly migrating into the US they may grow into the largest cannabis company worldwide just in terms of revenue.

Over the previous 12 months, Aphria put up $443 million USD in revenue compared to Canopy Growth's $377m USD. Tilray has put up $201m USD in the last 12 months, and which combined with Aphria is $644m USD, or markedly higher than the $377m USD posted by the ""industry standard,"" Canopy Growth. (I don't hate on Canopy as a company whatsoever I just think they're overvalued and their stock should not be in the $40s).

Stats from the merger indicated a $685 million annual revenue, adjusted for combined sales, and the company itself, named Tilray, will have a roughly $3.5 billion valuation.

Also, many forget that Tilray has a business partnership with Anheuser-Busch and Aphria owns the craft beer company SweetWater. (Which, personally, is fucking delicious.)

**For the shareholder:** Each Aphria share will convert to 0.8381 shares of Tilray. As of today (Monday, 02/08/21) the closing price of Tilray was $30.09 and the price of Aphria was $18.98. In accordance to the **1 : .8381** conversion rate, the implied price of Aphria is $25.22, which has a 33% upside compared to the current share price.

I don't know the current borrowing rates (if anyone does please feel free to comment), but in January of 2019 the shorting cost for Tilray was above 900% and has been known to remain very high on this stock, as after it's $300 rally a couple years ago it became a favorite among the shorts. There is a way in which to capitalize on the merger by being long on Aphria and short Tilray, but the 30% profit may be outweighed by the crazy high costs of borrowing.

The two biggest risks appear to be the possibility that Aphria shares will crash days before the merger, or that that Tilray has simply been overvalued this entire time and its share price will fall. (*The strategy is listed in the sources here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4404265-tilray-aphria-30-merger-arbitrage-is-tough-to-play) *& here* [*https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses*](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4401101-aphria-and-tilray-option-strategy-enhances-returns-and-mitigates-losses) *but you can only open the articles once without a subscription*

**For everyone:** The general consensus on both stocks is bullish, however, more focus is placed on buying into Tilray than Aphria, seemingly just due to the belief that people may jump ship days before Aphria shares are converted into Tilray (even though Aphria still owns the operation). The company will also have easy access into the United States as our president restructures drug scheduling, so moving forward, I feel that Tilray is going to be a strong global competitor in the cannabis industry for some time

I try not to go balls deep on anything that has a lot of hype on it, but Tilray made me BANK right when I first started investing a few months before Canada legalized so I may be biased. However, as objectively as I can be, I do think this merger is both a very strong short and long option.

I don't really know if it's a necessary disclaimer or a joke but I'm gonna go ahead and say no, none of this is financial advice.

**My positions:** 100 APHA @ $11.13,  2 TSLA @ $408.66,  3 GME @ $165,  10 AMC @ $17.04,  100 SNDL @ $1.13,  100 22 RIGL @ $4.40

Edit 2:  Added the following list below of supporting info for legalizing marijuana nationwide.

A trio of U.S. senators has given investors the green light to invest in  marijuana stocks, an endorsement that suggests the volatile sector might finally  blossom into something as acceptable and regulated as alcohol.

More details will emerge when Sens. Cory Booker (D., N.J.),  Ron Wyden, (D., Ore.), and Chuck Schumer (D.,  N.Y.) introduce legislation to legalize and tax marijuana.

""In the early part of this year, we will release a unified discussion draft  on comprehensive reform to ensure restorative justice, protect public health and  implement responsible taxes and regulations,"" they announced Feb.  1 in a joint statement.

The marijuana sector has, naturally, advanced higher. The sector proxy, the  ETFMG Alternative Harvest exchange- traded fund , has seemingly entered a new,  higher trading range. The ETF holds 35 stocks, including Aphria(APHA) , Canopy Growth(CGC) , and GW Pharmaceuticals(GWPH) . The fund has about  $1.4 billion under management, which makes it the largest ETF  that targets the global cannabis industry.

In anticipation of the pending legislation, and in an attempt to harness the  momentum of other investors, aggressive investors can consider buying ETFMG  Alternative Harvest. The ETF is trading near a record high, but an options  strategy can potentially reshape the price.

With the ETF at $27.82, investors can sell the March  $25 put option for $1.90 and buy the March  $29 call option for about $2.80. The ""risk  reversal"" -- selling a put and buying a call with a higher strike price but  similar expiration -- positions investors for agreeing to buy the ETF at  $25 and for participating in gains above $29.

If the ETF is at $35 at March expiration, the call is worth $6.

The trade's risk is predicated on the pending legislation. The trade obligates investors to buy the stock at $23, or to cover the put  or roll the position, if the stock price is below the strike price at  expiration. For that reason, only do this trade if you have the resources and  willingness to buy the ETF at a lower price and a belief in marijuana's pending  legalization. If something happens in Washington that derails marijuana legalization  efforts, the trade falls apart.

Still, the trade is a good way for investors to gain exposure to the  legalization of marijuana, which seems like a good bet as federal government  contends with massive deficits caused by the 2007-09 financial crisis and the  Covid-19 pandemic.

The ETF was chosen over component stocks to potentially reduce the investment  risk that is inherent in picking stocks in an unusual sector with companies that  have a history of extraordinary price volatility.

During the past 52 weeks, the ETF has ranged from $8.81 to  $27.90. The fund gained about 45% over the past year and is up  some 67% this year. The percentage returns seem stellar, but it is important to  remember that the fund has advanced off a low price, and that many of the  components weren't much better situated. The sector could be facing a critical  moment, and this trade puts investors into the center of the industry with a  strategy that can be reset as each month passes.

$UMC and other ‚Äúless glamorous‚Äù semi-conductor manufacturers will likely do well in the coming months,103,lg5kmw,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg5kmw/umc_and_other_less_glamorous_semiconductor/,40,1612912946.0,"With stock shortages on many different nodes from the likes of Samsung, TSMC and even Intel (which has a very dominate position in the server-space), there have been problems getting various products to market. Entire automative factories have been shut-down due to constraints on on getting chips in their vehicles. This phenomenon was predicted to be less unrelenting, but recently, many manufacturers (particularly Microsoft regarding the Xbox Series X) have basically admitted that they simply can‚Äôt sell their products due to the limits on chips designer‚Äôs limits of wafers of a given process node.

As a rundown, Intel, TSMC are the ‚Äúbig fabs‚Äù that you hear about in advanced computing technology. AMD uses TSMC, but AMD is on a 4-front battle with its console, desktop CPU, server CPU, and GPU market, as well as mobile chips. Essentially, any company in the position of AMD (even Intel and Nvidia are facing this problem) that can sell its products like hotcakes, but can‚Äôt get the nodes they need for their top-of-the-line products is bound by what they ordered months or years in advance. It is very likely that this will resonate as a prime reason to use lesser-utilized nodes by other companies for various other components (Internet-of-things, 5G etc...)

Essentially, chip *designers* are being constrained by their ability to gain access to various chips. But the fabs behind these ‚Äúbig-name‚Äù computing technology companies that you‚Äôre used to hearing about are essentially bidding with eachother for these same advanced process nodes, kicking smaller (and by *smaller* I don‚Äôt mean *small*, I mean literally anyone that isn‚Äôt trying to +1 extremely advanced computing products).

TSMC is producing process nodes that perform very well. Except, their supply is very limited. Keep in mind, Chip *designers* will often times outsource their designs to be made on different nodes. Intel uses TSMC, even though it has its own fabs, for instance. And Intel also rents out their own fabs.

This is where $UMC and various other lesser-known semi-conductor manufacturers come in. They will likely fill the massive demand for *any* process node that chip designers can get their hands on to fill the unprecedented shortages which seem to be pushed back farther and farther.

Eventually, your average, run-of-the-mill devices will need chips in them, and they are likely to have difficulties working with more well-renowned chip-makers to actually put their architectures on a given node. In general, chip-manufacturers have had the lion‚Äôs share of consistent performance over the past year due to increasingly innovative products from high-profile designers. It‚Äôs quite possible many device-manufacturers will opt not to use larger semi-conductor fabs as big-names like AMD, NVidia, and even Apple are competing for the same nodes.

At the very least, a lot of the previous success of semi-conductor manufacturers and chip designers may potentially trickle down to lesser-utilized and less glamorous fabs.

There‚Äôs already a precedent that very specialized chip designs will often go to these manufacturers, and now that the big names literally are fighting for these advanced nodes, many chipmakers have used Global Foundries and other ‚Äúless sexy‚Äù fabs to meet demand for chips that they *need* now.

In general, companies with semiconductor fabs are likely to do well, simply due to the fact that the world in general needs more wafers, substrates etc... as infrastructure becomes more complex, digitally.

I recommend researching semi-conductor manufacturers who have long been underdogs.

There has been a tier 1 KILLSWITCH operation aiming to make GME disappear. And for many, it worked.

No longer is GME on the lips of every mother and father in the beautiful United States.

No longer is it the meme of the week, they want us to move on, forget about the stock, forget our fallen comrades at level 300, 400, 450...

But nay, We will never forget our fallen. I sure as hell haven't, and I am still holding on like a vice grip.

We cannot manipulate the market by telling our community what WE (ourselves) are doing... yet... Main Street players and Jim Cramer and the likes go on national television to brag about how they manipulated the markets to make profit knowing the SEC won't do shit. Now his clown ass is desperately trying to do the same to those videos on YT as they have done to GME.  But the internet never forgets.

This is absolute bullshit. The only and safest thing I can do is hold my shares. ^(\*you do you, this is only what I am doing and this is not recommended nor is it financial advice.)

BUT I'm holding to the bitter end if it comes to that. I lost 88% so what's another 12% mean to me?

Nothing.

I am only writing this to find the ears of my fellow R-tards across the world who grow weak on this battlefield. We are bombarded by days of attrition. But do not waver my lads. This is only the beginning.

My logic is this, I've read many DD articles and YouTubes videos (which means I am a pro autist by this point) and from what I've gathered, the shorts still have yet to cover and if anything they are doubling down to make even more money from the crash of this stock.

Well hedgies... I SAY:

AMC didn't get bought again like all my other stocks did which is sketchy but it's okay I'll just buy it again but no wait my instant access is denied until my money fully deposits in 4-5 business days and I cannot open any new positions until then but if that's the case why was I able to buy all my other stocks and not AMC

So stop gnawing on your crayons for a second and pay attention.

First off, quick summary for people who can read an 8-K. If you only understand üöÄüöÄüöÄ , don't worry, I explain it in more detail with more emojis.

**TL;DR:** PTON just finalized sales of convertible notes and they're using $71M from the proceeds to buy call options on themselves to negate any dilutionary effects. They state in their 8-K  that the option counterparty is going to be buying PTON stock IMMEDIATELY to hedge risk. However you cut it, that's likely 300k-1M+ shares that need to be bought this week.

[https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750](https://investor.onepeloton.com/news-releases/news-release-details/peloton-interactive-inc-announces-pricing-upsized-offering-8750)

## The Play

If that was gibberish, I'll try to spell it out. PTON just sold $1B of convertible notes to wall street.

***What are convertible notes?***

Convertible notes are a type of debt, but instead of just offering to repay the debtor with cash, you give them the option of converting their loan to newly issued shares at a price established before hand. You could also think of it as a call option but, if it's out of the money at expiration, you can get your premium back, and if it's in the money you can ask the company to issue new shares for you.

***What's a call option?***

GTFO

***But wait, isn't creating new shares bad? Wouldn't that dilute the stock?***

Congrats on following along, normally yes. Normally shareholders react negatively to announcements of convertible notes. But PTON is simultaneously buying call options that will accrue value if their common stock gains enough value for the notes to be ""in the money"".

***What's the ""strike price"" for PTON's convertible notes?***

This is called the conversion price. The notes are only worth more than their face value if PTON closes above **$240/share**. üöÄ That's 65% upside from today.

***How big is the loan?***

PTON initially offered $600M of notes with the option to purchase an additional $90M. Clearly there was so much interest in that they expanded it to $875M with the option to purchase an additional $125M.

***Is there an expiration date?***

Neither party can do anything before 2024, between 2024 and 2026 investors can convert their notes.

***What's the interest rate?***

Get this, it's **0% interest**.

Let me repeat all that, as it's insane. **The debtors agreed to let PTON owe them $1B for 4-6 years at 0% interest, in exchange for the privilege of converting their investment into PTON shares at $240/share in 4 years.**

Meaning who ever is making this loan not only thinks PTON shares are going to be worth AT LEAST $240 in 4 years, but above $240 enough that this will beat inflation and any other safer investment they could make with that money.

***What's the significance of PTON using call options?***

They state in their 8-K that **they expect the option counterparty (the seller of the call options) to purchase PTON common stock to hedge their position, concurrently or immediately after pricing**. Pricing was finalized this morning. This will happen this week. In order to reach a delta neutral position the option counterparty has to purchase a lot of shares. How many, I don't know, depends on the delta of the spreads, but since they're buying $70M in call spreads that are $116 wide, I assume anywhere between $50M of shares to something like $150M. That's about \~300k-1M shares. That's a big chunk of the average volume however you cut it.

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**How to play this?**

üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Buy call options and shares. I am personally going with 6/18 $160c. I will likely roll these 30 to 60 days to expiration as I see PTON as a long term play. You can choose something closer to expiration.

Caveat, the short term play may not work out. If you buy FDs you might lose your money. The counterparty may do an OTC transaction that gets reported at a later date. I don't really know how any of that works, and you're reading a non-professional's analysis.

If you buy longer expiration options or shares, even if the price doesn't go up this week, it will go up eventually.

## LONG TERM BULLISH STUFF

This is going to be a subjective argument. As a general piece of advice, reading random laypeople's number crunching on the internet is not going to serve you well. I'm being honest with you that I've neither put in the work nor am I qualified to be estimating future earnings or giving you a price target.

That being said, I have some financial advice for you: PTON is going to the moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ üåùüåï and you should take a bullish position if you like money.

Yes, I've read all the bearish crap about their financials. The thing is, companies look risky until they don't. I think this one will break out. Clearly lots of wall street institutions think so as well.

## Fundamentals

***Institutional ownership?***

70%. Wall Street is bullish af on this. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

***Why would someone buy a $1500 exercise bike with an ipad?***

I mean this in a non-judgemental and nice way but if you don't understand why someone would purchase a $1500 exercise bike, you are probably poor.

PTON really is the first luxury product in this category. They really succeeded in making the product aspirational. People *want* to own this bike. There is a certain Apple like feel to it. It's a class signifier. It says something about the owner. It looks pretty. You can display it in your living room if you want.

It's cheaper than an Equinox membership. Yes you could go to planet fitness for cheaper but you could also drink ketchup for dinner.

If you have the money, it doesn't make sense to skimp too much on exercise equipment. If you're gonna hate your janky bike from AliExpress, you won't use it.

PTON keeps reporting quarter after quarter that **they are supply limited:** they're selling these bikes as fast as they can be made. This is flying off the shelves like Teslas.

Their subscription plan has the lowest rates of churn in the industry.

***End of the pandemic?***

Your view of the pandemic is short-sighted. The changes in the economy are not temporary, the pandemic really accelerated trends that were already there. I don't expect people to go back to gyms. Lots of people bought exercise equipment during this period, including myself. I hate gyms so much. People stare at you, it's far away, you have to change in public like it's high school.

The experience of hopping on your bike and joining a spin class or doing your own routine is 1000x better. I have become evangelical about how great owning a home spin bike is. Gyms lied to you with their stupid machines, whatever they have at gyms is easily replicated with a yoga mat, a set of  dumbbells and an exercise bike. That's really all your gym needs. Gyms were a flawed concept that relied on making cancellation difficult and making you feel bad about it.

***Positions***

6/19 160c üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Shares üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

**tl:dr;** Some options writer has to buy a million PTON shares this week, maybe. Also long term PTON is the future of exercise and it's going to the moon.

**Disclaimer**; I am long PTON. I will gain money if this goes to the moon.

**EDIT:** Please don't downvote people who share bearish views in a polite and reasonable way. It doesn't help anyone to suppress opposing view points. Pic for the thumbnail:

Oil got crushed March 2020 due to corolla virus and went negative for first time. I started putting money into Levered ETF's (GUSH, NRGU) around this time and have seen some pretty good returns but the best is yet to come.

Keystone Pipeline is gone which brought gas from Canada all the way through the US (the pipeline would be carbon neutral) which was putting the US on a path to gas/oil independence from the Middle East. This will push the demand of gas to the Middle East where there is basically no regulations on how the oil is treated - but hey were trying to save the earth!! This shift in demand from local gas/oil to the Middle East will drive oil prices back up. Strap in retards.

Dont be retarded, Oil is not going anywhere. Most countries are still using coal for energy - which charges those super clean electric cars!",2021-02-09 22:39:39

We all know small caps make movement very possible with volume and lately there seems to have been a lot of interest in small cap securities.   


Specifically, IWM averages 20% growth every year. Current movement:

3M: 28.49%  
1M: 9.97%  
1W: 6.67%  
1D: 2.55%  


Now lets get into call pricing:  
2/12 245c are wildly cheap. 7% to strike. $.01-$.03  
2/19 260c are also cheap af, but 14% to strike, with a little more time. $.01-$.03  


In this volatile climate, it pays to be an absolute idiot. 

What I'm saying is, recoup some losses here you diamond handed bastards. I've learned so much from this incredibly degenerate corner of the internet, and this is my first attempt at offering something back.

Daddy's DD of the week: $BB,2305,lg4gx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg4gx4/daddys_dd_of_the_week_bb/,382,1612909786.0,"So i've been doing some research on certain companies and have been doing well on the one's i invest. This is my first DD so let's see how it goes!

Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor and these are my own opinions.

So, where to begin with $BB? We have seen the rise and fall of so-called, ""meme stocks"" to which $BB was grouped in with. Shortly thereafter, we saw some of them drop off ($BB, $NOK, etc.) while the focus remained on $GME and $AMC.

I am writing this because I, personally, believe in a huge rebound for $BB because they are the forefront of modern technology when it comes to autonomous vehicular design. In the article below we see that $BB's QNX technology is being utilized with Motional's autonomous vehicle design. This is as of Feb 9, 2021 (TODAY!)

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberrys-qnx-black-channel-communications-to-be-used-in-motionals-driverless-platform)

Here we see, ""[BlackBerry Limited](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en) (NYSE: BB; TSX: BB) today announced an expansion of its strategic partnership with [Baidu](http://iv.baidu.com/), whose high-definition maps will run on the [QNX¬Æ Neutrino¬Æ Real-time](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/software-solutions/embedded-software/qnx-neutrino-rtos) Operating System (RTOS) and will be mass-produced in the forthcoming GAC New Energy Aion models from the EV arm of [GAC Group](https://www.gac-motor.com/) (Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., Ltd.).""

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2021/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology)

For those of you who don't know, BAIDU is a Chinese multi-national corporation valued at over 573 Billion dollars. This is HUGE news.

As if that wasn't enough, they also mentioned in Dec of 2020 a partnership with AWS to utilize their software to accelerate their innovation with new intelligent vehicle data platform.

[https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2020/aws-blackberry-join-forces-to-accelerate-innovation-with-new-intelligent-vehicle-data-platform)

I find this all super promising as it appears that $BB has drawn away from the idea of phones and has started investing time and resources in their software for the future of society which in my opinion is autonomous vehicles.

Whether this is short or a long term play, I LIKE THE STOCK!

p.s. if this goes well i would like to start doing weekly DD's",2021-02-09 22:29:46

Plausible explanation for the GME situation,57,lg44jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg44jz/plausible_explanation_for_the_gme_situation/,115,1612908726.0,"Let us imagine companies A and B are in the same industry but politically divergent, for example Wind vs Coal, or in our case, GameStop vs Amazon, perhaps.

Wealthy investors C and D are politically aligned to B (Coal).

Investor C buys a long position in A, then loans out its shares to investor D with no intention to ever sell. 

Investor C reinvests the interest received from this lending into B.

Investor D sells the loaned shares to new investors E, F, and G.

Investor D uses the proceeds from the sale to pay off the loan interest then reinvests the remainder elsewhere or into Company B. Investor D is under no pressure to cover as they have a mutual agreement C will never sell.

Now in this simplified example, consumers EFG believe they are investing in their aligned interest, Wind, but in fact, the money is being immediately redistributed to Coal.

All legal and above board, right?",2021-02-09 22:12:06
Corsair Earnings Report,202,lg43fp,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lg43fp/corsair_earnings_report/,101,1612908634.0,"[https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020](https://ir.corsair.com/news-releases/news-release-details/corsair-gaming-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020)

&#x200B;

**Major Highlights**

* 55% increased revenue YOY
* Over 100% increased revenue
* Full year of surpassing earnings expectations
* Outlook to increase revenue by another 5-10% throughout 2021

**Competitors**

* Primary competitor is LOGI.  CRSR outpaces LOGI in earnings growth.  CRSR operates at a market cap of 4B, compared to LOGI's 15B, despite having a revenue approx. half of LOGI's, pointing to CRSR being undervalued.

**Issues**

* Low float, leading to higher volatility.  Can be a benefit if looking at playing options spreads (keep that IV crush away from me)
* IPO Lockup.  Ends on March 22, so expect a potential decrease as early investors take profits.

Overall, CRSR has another quarter of showing a quickly growing company with a huge chunk of their market.  Bullish

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Tuesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/09/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-9-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Dow set to dip after six-session win streak

> * U.S. stock futures fell Tuesday, taking a pause after the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose for their sixth straight sessions and the Nasdaq did so for its third session in a row. All three benchmarks logged record-high closes. February‚Äôs blistering gains ahead of Tuesday‚Äôs trading on Wall Street sent the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq up nearly 4.7%, 5.4% and 7%, respectively.

*****

> # 2. Trump‚Äôs second impeachment trial to begin in Senate

> * Former President Donald Trump faces the start of his second impeachment trial, an uphill battle for Democrats determined to prove him guilty for inciting last month‚Äôs deadly riot at the U.S. Capitol. Despite the unprecedented circumstances, experts see acquittal as the likely outcome. Out of office for nearly three weeks, the one-term Republican president, ensconced at his Florida home, still commands the support of swaths of the party and the loyalty of many GOP lawmakers, who largely doubt the legality of the trial itself. The trial is scheduled to start at 1 p.m. ET.

*****

> # 3. CBO says federal minimum wage of $15 would cost jobs

> * Raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25 per hour in annual increments to $15 per hour, as President Joe Biden has proposed, would cost 1.4 million jobs over the next four years while lifting 900,000 people out of poverty, according to a report released Monday by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The hike would add to the budget deficit, which could help Democrats pull the issue into the budget reconciliation process. Doing so could enable the Democrats to pass Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion Covid stimulus approach with no Republican votes. As part of the pandemic relief effort, House Democrats on Monday proposed a faster income phase-out for the next round of direct payments checks.

*****

> # 4. WHO says animals to humans ‚Äòmost likely‚Äô path of coronavirus

> * An international team of scientists led by the World Health Organization said Tuesday the search for how the coronavirus was introduced remains a ‚Äúwork in progress,‚Äù but the ‚Äúmost likely‚Äù pathway was indeed from animals to humans. Scientists have been working for the past four weeks in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first identified in late 2019. The team dismissed a leak from a lab, saying that such theories should be regarded as ‚Äúextremely unlikely.‚Äù

*****

> # 5. Reddit‚Äôs valuation doubles to $6 billion after new funding

> * Reddit ‚Äî ground zero for the recent online-driven individual investor trading mania ‚Äî raised more than $250 million in a new round of funding, doubling its valuation to $6 billion. Activity in Reddit‚Äôs WallStreetBets forum sparked a frenzy of buying in heavily shorted stocks, sending names like GameStop skyrocketing last month. Shares of the video game retailer ‚Äî which lost 70% last week after soaring 400% the previous week ‚Äî dropped another 5.9% on Monday and were under pressure in Tuesday‚Äôs premarket.

**THE BEST PART**

They are expecting nearly **$2 billion** in revenue for 2021. And the current market cap is $4.16 billion. They are literally trading at only about twice the 2021 revenues. Which is the cheapest valuation for a company growing at this rate.

Thus if you buy a CFD you are not impacting any supply and demand situation in the market. you are in effect just placing a bet on which way the price will go. There are many so called brokers and apps that only sell CFDs such as eToro etc.

If you buy a CFD from, say, eToro or equivalent you will not impact any short squeeze scenario since the actual asset (share) is not owned by you and where applicable you will not be entitled to any share dividends either. 

If you want to help impact the market please ensure you are actually buying the stock you are bidding for. CFDs are just a form of spread betting.

This will only change once batteries are dense enough to make electric planes - we're not there and even if we'd come up with the technology tomorrow, it'd still take many years to replace all planes.

GEVO is still a small cap, but they might totally play along XOM (200 billion), Shell (120 billion) or BP (74 billion) in a couple of years. Worst case at this point is that they will stay where they are, I just don't see how the stock could go down given the circumstances - the next 4 years will be smooth sailing under Biden.

Reddit Doubles Valuation To $6B As It Raises Money In A 'Good Market',177,lfz6ar,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfz6ar/reddit_doubles_valuation_to_6b_as_it_raises_money/,31,1612893253.0,"Reddit said Monday it raised more than $250 million in Series E funding from both existing and new investors.

What Happened: The social news aggregator and discussion website's current investors include Tencent Holdings Ltd (OTC: redacted), Andreessen Horowitz, and Sequoia Capital, according to Crunchbase.

Reddit has doubled its valuation to $6 billion in the latest funding round, which was led by Vy Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Reddit CEO Steve Huffman said that it was a 'good market to fundraise.'

'Valuations are very high right now. It never hurts to raise money when there's an opportunity to do so and Reddit had a strong year,' the executive told the Journal pointing to a 90% YoY increase in advertising revenue in the quarter ended December.

Why It Matters: Reddit has been in the limelight after r/WallStreetBets, a community of retail investors on the platform, short squeezed stocks of GameStop Corp (NYSE: GME), AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted, Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) and others.


'We are also readying to double the number of Reddit employees this year; it's surprising not only for the pace of growth but also that such a relatively lean team has been behind one of the most visited websites in the world,' the social media company said in a statement.

Reddit purchased video-based social media platform Dubsmash in December.

Stuff for new traders (No GME Discussion),6878,lfxux0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfxux0/stuff_for_new_traders_no_gme_discussion/,668,1612887066.0,"I gotta say, I see some good shit out there. I see new members trying to diversify their positions and learn about other stocks and other ways to make money. This is the path my fellow retards. I'm a nobody here, but I have good returns and some good insight. When I came to WSB, multiple people helped me figure out what the fuck I was doing, because I knew jack shit. I care more about my money than yours, but no retard should be left in the dark alone. So let me pass on a couple things. I can't prove shit to you, so read this or don't.

I mainly trade options (Calls and Puts), so that is what I will discuss

Generally the most insane gains will come from being in a specific stock and not an ETF or Index. While riskier, this is where you can hit the homeruns. So decide if you want to go for conservative gains or if you want those huge swings. While what I said is true, I am usually against putting everything into a single bet. Anything can go wrong at any time and no play is 100% guaranteed. The goal of this game is to stay alive. You will lose money on a play at some point, because it is inevitable. So never let yourself get wiped out, because you can always build yourself back up. This goes along with one of my other recommendations: always have SOME cash ready to go. You never know when there might be an incredible opportunity and you do not want to get caught with your ass hanging out.

Paper hands and diamond hands are just words. You ultimately decide when you want to sell or hold and how much profit you want to take. One of my favorite strategies is to say, buy an even number of options on a play, sell half at a modest level of gains (like enough to break even or gain a little bit) and then let the rest ride longer. Look guys, on many plays, you either paper hands at some point or diamond hands long enough to see your positions go red. Some people will bail at 40% gains and others might not take anything less than 500%. Just know that chasing endless profits ups the risk factor, so YOU decide when it's time. Having a target share price for the stock is also a good strategy.

Here's a couple psychological principles in investing. Studies have found that people tend to hold onto losing positions too long and sell winning positions too early. They let their losers lose and cut off their winners short. Apparently most people hate losing more than they like winning. Think about this before you sell. Stocks can often get hot and run multiple days in a row. Sometimes a stock will have one red day and then keep up going. This is why it's important to know WHY you got into a position. Trust your DD and stick to the plan. I had ideas for plays where they went red right away and I bailed... only to see them moon. ""Diamond Hands"" means that you don't dump your position instantly if it goes down. The hardest thing is knowing if you should cut losses or diamond hands. I'm a retard and we're in a bull market.. so often times the stock will eventually go up. Your call though.

The market makers and big boys want you to lose. They want your money. I'm not going to dive into the realm of possible illegal activities that they may use, but just point out some simpler tactics they will use. Big money often sees retail as ""weak hands"" aka Buy High and Sell Low. They know FOMO is strong when a stock is going up big and that fear takes over when a stock divebombs. We're in a bull market, which means stonks only go up. However, we still have negative days. Stocks sell off sometimes and things can look bad. Generally, the dip is not time to sell, but instead, time to buy. Case and point, we had a pretty big drilling 2 weeks ago. Do you know what the big money did? They bought the fuckin dip and snatched up everything for cheap. We've been mooning ever since.

Sometimes shit makes no sense. A company can have blowout earnings, exceed expectations, and the stock will tank. I was holding one stock a little while ago that reported a fantastic earnings and proceeded to drill to the core of the Earth that day. It was total bullshit and I knew it, I trusted my DD. So instead of panic selling, I added to my position. Sure enough, the stock began swinging upwards and hit an all-time high just 2 weeks later. This is why simply gambling can bite you in the ass. It's easy to get scared and sell when you doubt yourself because you picked a random thing to buy.

Option Expiration Dates matter. Buying a 1 week option is the cheapest and gives the biggest percentage of profits if it goes your way. However, it can often be a noob trap. One bad day or one piece of bad news can kill your entire position. Stocks trade sideways sometimes. Sometimes they don't do what you think they should do. And sometimes the whole fucking market shits itself for seemingly no reason. So give yourself TIME to work with. Time costs money and hurts profit margins. But it is better to consistently make 50% profit than to hit one play for 300% followed by 10 losers. Look, playing weekly stupidly OTM calls is fun as hell and is a huge rush when it hits. I do at least one or more every week. The key is not loading your entire portfolio into this shit. Remember, no tendies = no more fun.

Along the same lines, Strike Price matters. An OTM (Out of the Money) option means that the Strike Price is a bit of a ways from where the stock's price currently is. OTM options give huge profit margins the further you go out. I personally enjoy using them.. some people don't. But my advice is to balance risk with profit potential. If your call relies on a stock gaining 50% in 2 weeks.. then well, it's probably not gonna happen. ITM (In The Money) options means that your stock is already within the strike price. ITM is a more conservative play and sacrifices massive gains for lower risk.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html) \- Use this to get an estimate of potential profits and how much of a move you need

Leaps are fuckin dope. A Leap is a call, but for a much longer period of time. I'm using the term loosely because we're degenerates and some people might consider anything more than 1 month a leap. Given that the market trends up over time, you might even make some money on a mediocre stock this way. A lot of people buy ITM leaps, but again, I'm a degenerate and go OTM a lot.

Implied Volatility (IV) - Extremely fucking important. IV is basically an estimation of how much a stock is predicted to move in either direction. High IV = Expensive Options. It's fucking weird to think, but you can make similar profits from a 2% move on a low IV stock as you can from a 5% move on a more volatile stock. Low IV is fantastic when buying an option on a stock that you think is about to moon. High IV is riskier, so you damn well better think the stock can make some big moves. Buying an option on a stock right before Earnings Report (ER) will be more expensive due to IV. Trying to play ER is usually for suckers, unless you have some really good DD about why a company might deliver a huge surprise. One of the textbook big boy moves is to pump a stock going into ER. The company will deliver great news and then dump hard. You may see people bitching about this very soon. Basically, big money knew ahead of time it would be good, so the stock got pumped and then they took profits.

Buy the rumor and sell the news. Events, press releases, and important dates that everyone knows about are another trap. You will get shit on. Ask someone about TESLA Battery Day. Positive rumors will send a stock soaring though.

Finally, get busy learning. Read about Options on Investopedia and any other things you do not understand. The big boys rely on us to not know what the fuck we're doing to take our money. Learn about the general market. Stocks are grouped into ""Sectors"" or categories. Start figuring out what they are and pay attention to where the money is going. I didn't even mention half of the shit that goes on in options, so that's on you. The first thing you need to do is to learn what the ""Greeks"" are. That will teach you how options function.

If anyone wants to talk or discuss, send me a message. I'm a degenerate with no life.

Oh and, if you follow someone's DD and lose money that's on you. I've come up with some genius shit, but I've also lost on some retarded calls. Nobody can pick you a guaranteed winner and hindsight is 20/20.

Smart Money makes you money. 

This is not financial advice. DO your own DD. 

Look before I get into it, when I pick stocks I like to see what institutions own them to see if there is smart money in there‚Ä¶ eg Cathie wood, Michael Burry.

The Stock I am talking about is CVS‚Ä¶ 

Well, I couldn‚Äôt believe my eye balls when I saw the OG GOAT- Dr Michael Burry had 10% of his portfolio in CVS. 

A lot of people ask for DD on stocks that haven‚Äôt done 100%+ in the last month. Well this is it and I am about to go down a rabbit hole on this one. Strap in.

\#1 Covid Vaccines- there is a potential for CVS to open up a section of there locations to administer Covid Vaccines after the increasing pressure on current administers. Meaning money from the government to cover this. Secondly,  Have you ever gone to CVS and just picked up your meds? I sure haven‚Äôt. I leave with that much Sh!t I didn‚Äôt need its not funny. SO imagine more foot traffic and more random impulse purchases. Like ‚ÄúOh wow, my wife‚Äôs boyfriend could use these 10 packs of Gatorades and vibrating Cuck Ring‚Äù.  So, increase in sales 

\#2- Fundamentals- skip this is if you don‚Äôt believe in the F word. 

¬∑ According to a number of research houses it is trading roughly at a 50% discount to it‚Äôs fair value

¬∑ PE Ratio is 11.9X which is lower than the industry average of 19x and Market 25x

¬∑ Future earnings estimated to grow at 9% on current conditions 

¬∑ Long term Assets $173.68 B vs $101.74B Liabilities

¬∑ \*Concern over short term assets $59B vs Short term Liabilities $62B

¬∑ Debt has been reducing since 2019 (not bad during a pandemic) 

¬∑ Interest payments on debt well covered by EBIT (6.4x) 

¬∑ Dividend pay out that has been stable and Is well covered by earnings 

\#3 New CEO Karen Lynch- I am not going to put her whole credentials in but it is quite impressive. There are many indications that she wants to revamp to the traditional offering- with the likes of delivery services and further unique ‚Äòin house‚Äô offerings. 

\#4  Institutional  Ownership 

¬∑ Vanguard $6.4 B (8%)

¬∑ BlackRock $5.6 B (7%)

¬∑ State Street $3.4B (4%)

¬∑ Capital Research $2.8 B (3.5%)

¬∑ Morgan Stanley $1.5B (1.8%)

\#5 Bureau of Healthcare working on their side

Amazon‚Äôs disruption is still quite some time away as- it will still require doctors to designate it, and patients to request it, when writing prescriptions. At some practices, switching prescriptions from one pharmacy to another has to be done during an office visit -- and many patients are avoiding those for now.

\#6 More than a Pharmacy 

¬∑ Aetna ‚Äì Health Insurance plans 

¬∑ Minute Clinic- providing access to doctors within or close to their stores 

¬∑ CVS intend to add dietitians and yoga to their locations along the lines of their healthhub 

¬∑ Potential Vaccine Adminsting stations. 

Earnings are expected on the 16th of this month. It‚Äôs not looking like they are going to shoot the lights out but this has been factored in. 

TLDR

¬∑ High Ownership from mutual Funds

¬∑ 10% of Michael Burry‚Äôs portfolio

¬∑ Potential to be the location and service to administer the COVID vaccine. 

¬∑ In house Doctors to prescribe medication (Amazon still requires visit to the doctor)

TDC - deeper DD as promised,230,lfulsm,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfulsm/tdc_deeper_dd_as_promised/,153,1612873883.0,"**TLDR**; TDC is a better Snowflake worth $70 to $300.

It is not ""the new Snowflake."" Snowflake is like Goldilocks in this scenario - it quickly developed a cloud-based  product (within 2012-2014) and stole some business from TDC...now TDC is back with a superior cloud offering, and it's about to kick Goldilocks out of its house.

**Investment Case**

Teradata is a data warehousing business (almost exactly like Snowflake). They briefly lost the crown to Snowflake (innovator's dilemma) in 2014, when they failed to pivot to the cloud...but that has all changed as of a few days ago.

The company shocked investors last week by reporting a massively-successful new cloud biz (see last week's earnings release [here](https://s23.q4cdn.com/501457330/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/TDC-4Q20-Earnings-Release-(1).pdf)).  **Teradata Vantage (established top-notch tech, now available in the cloud) posted $100+ million in revenues last year, at a 160% growth rate**. This is in direct competition with Snowflake, a $90 billion business **with only $450 million in revenues**. Not only that, but research suggests that Teradata Vantage is far superior to Snowflake (see below). The company's CEO even suggests that **they are stealing business back from Snowflake**. TDC stock is worth $70 in the immediate near-term, possibly $150-300 if valued like Snowflake.

**TDC is NOT an emerging disruptor**. This is an established, 40-year pioneer in data warehousing. These guys led the way for decades and are now deploying their already-developed, superior (more scalable) tech to the cloud to displace Snowflake and take back the crown.

Either Snowflake is not worth $90 billion, or Teradata is...

&#x200B;

**Overview**

Teradata is an enterprise data warehousing business, i.e. TDC enables customers/businesses to access/manage data, generate insights, and use these findings to make informed decisions.

**Data Warehousing Industry / Tailwinds**

* Data warehousing is the process of capturing, storing, managing and analyzing data. Pretty catch-all phrase but this is a catch-all business, fam. It applies to literally everything.
* Companies use data warehousing software to acquire, aggregate and integrate data from multiple sources (different geographies, business units, etc).
* Analytical services are layered on to help businesses make informed, data-driven decisions
* Total addressable market is $81 billion, according to Snowflake in 2020.
   * Snowflake‚Äôs S-1 filing: ‚Äú...the markets for Analytics Data Management and Integration Platforms and Business Intelligence and Analytics Tools, which we believe we address, will have a combined value of **$56 billion by the end of 2020 and $84 billion by the end of 2023.**‚Äù
   * That‚Äôs an industry-wide CAGR of \~15%

**Company History**

TDC was a pioneer in data warehousing. The company launched in 1979 and developed a cutting edge relational database platform by 1984. TDC was acquired by AT&T (NCR) in the early 90‚Äôs, and created the world‚Äôs first 1TB database system for Walmart in 1992. In 1996, it spun off from AT&T in ‚Äò96 as NCR Corp. TDC spun off from NCR in 2007 as an independent company and the largest standalone data warehousing biz. So 40+ years of experience in data warehousing.

Chief Technology Officer Stephen Brobst has been involved in some shape or form since the NCR days in the early 90's. He has been CTO since 1999. In 2014, Brobst was ranked the top 4th CTO in the US - yea up there with Tesla and Amazon CTO's ([source](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/teradata-executive-stephen-brobst-named-one-of-top-four-chief-technology-officers-in-us-276001651.html)). Brobst is clearly a visionary and top mind in the business.

TDC was historically focused on the legacy server construct. Back then, the thought of a utility-like public cloud (AWS) becoming the industry standard was laughable. Companies ran their own servers and relied on on-prem solutions. TDC deployed on-prem database software, servers, analytical software and related consulting services.

TDC was a well-known name in the business world; in 2008, customers included Coca-Cola, FedEx, Wells Fargo and a long list of other boomer stocks. Historically, IBM and Oracle were listed as top competitors. Pre 2014, Teradata was considered THE data warehousing leader (ahead of ORCL, IBM) by Gartner. Today, its cloud product is back at the top (yes, above Snowflake, see below).

Over the years TDC shifted focus from the legacy data warehousing business to upselling big data analytics and marketing solutions. This was the investment case in \~2013 when I pitched the stock to my college investment club (shoutout CIG). However, TDC‚Äôs legacy offering wasn‚Äôt well-suited for the cloud, which was starting to gain a lot of hype and traction. This rustled everyone‚Äôs jimmies and TDC started to collapse from 2012-2014, when Snowflake launched its cloud-based offering and started stealing market share. Emerging tech like Hadoop and Amazon‚Äôs AWS native offering (Redshift) were also major threats.

So there you have it, TDC was king of the ‚Äúdata warehousing‚Äù hill, failed to pivot to the cloud, lost to Snowflake and was in decline...until now.

**TDC today**

Teradata has rebranded itself as a ‚Äúhybrid cloud analytics software provider,‚Äù meaning it can run its database software (Teradata Vantage) on-prem, in the public cloud, private cloud or all of the above. Literally exactly what Snowflake does, perhaps even better (more on that later).

TDC was purpose-built for complex queries. The company spent the past 40+ years leading/ innovating and accumulating 600+ patents. This IP is the result of massive spending and effort over the years - the result was a company that eventually enjoyed 25% cash flow returns on capital before Snowflake went and punched them in the balls. Now TDC is coming back with a vengeance.

TDC Vantage is a fixed-cost, scalable software platform. The company is basically taking decades of research and refined technique, and migrating it to the cloud. R&D has already been spent and TDC claims to be multiple years ahead of Snowflake (see below). Now it just needs to move this IP to the cloud and print cash.

The company is now run by CEO Steve McMillan, who previously tried to compete against TDC at IBM (19 years) and Oracle...and failed (his own admission, see article below). McMillan was brought in to turn the company around after it failed under previous leadership to pivot to the cloud. Now, he  is executing better than anyone expected.

Last week, TDC shocked investors when it broke out cloud-based annual recurring revenues (ARRs) of $100 million, up 160% from a year prior. This was the first mention of their success in the cloud and a surprise to longs and shorts alike.

In the most recent earnings call, sell-side analysts were glowing:

**Cloud Implications**

* Cloud-based subscriptions are cheap to deploy. They don‚Äôt involve massive up-front costs to acquire a perpetual license/on-prem deployment. For those that don't know, this is like subscribing to Netflix vs. buying movies yourself. the former is much cheaper up-front.
* TDC users pay based on their computing needs, so revenues are NOT recognized ratably like other SaaS stocks. Revenues are recognized as customers compute, so revenue growth is directly tied to the volume of usage of the platform. This is a VERY attractive business model and effectively a toll bridge on cloud computing.
* TDC‚Äôs legacy on-prem business **WAS** lumpy because of the large upfront cost, which resulted in long sales cycles and required executive/CEO-level approvals to complete a sale. New cloud-based offering is lower-cost up front and easier to sell. This will enable shorter sales cycles and faster growth.
* Large scale data warehousing requires a lot of human touch/tailoring. TDC is very experienced in helping big businesses with these large database transitions. They have a solid consulting business purpose-built for this. These consultants didn‚Äôt get stupid overnight - TDC can leverage its years of experience to offer a more tailored experience vs. Snowflake, which has only been doing this for 6 years and doesn‚Äôt have a massive consulting effort.
* While TDC has been in decline for years, it‚Äôs bled customers at a slower-than expected pace. This is because many TDC customers spent a shit load of money upfront to integrate their business data on TDC databases. These customers still fork over $1.5 billion to TDC per year - they will probably be converted over to the cloud-based offering (which results in more attractive economics and earnings visibility). This last part is a crucial aspect of the valuation (below).

**Competitive Advantages**

* *Network effects*: as customers move data to the cloud, the more easily data can be exchanged between customers that share the same platform
   * Snowflake cited this as a competitive advantage, it applies to TDC as well
* *High switching costs*: adopting a large database is a time consuming process that is also a pain in the ass. Once complete, people don‚Äôt want to leave. This is evident in TDC customer retention even in spite of cloud disruptions.
* *Cost savings*: data insights result in cost savings for the customer. this is the difference between life and death of business these days
* *Intellectual Property*: Decades‚Äô worth of IP (600+ patents) and reputation as an industry pioneer

**\*\*\*\* Competitive Positioning \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* (READ THIS IF YOU READ ANYTHING AT ALL)**

Not only is TDC pivoting to the cloud to survive, but research suggests that it might even be better than Snowflake.

In a recent interview, CEO Steve McMillan said the following

>‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to say a couple things that will surprise some people,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI think our 40-year heritage in helping organizations get the best out of their data \[gives us\] a set of experiences and a set of capabilities and a set of technology advances that ***Snowflake are going to have to take a long time to catch up with us***\*.\*‚ÄúLook, if you want to set up a simple data mart with a little bit of DSS \[decision support systems\], Snowflake is going to work fine for you,‚Äù McMillan continues. ‚ÄúFor companies that want to operate at enterprise scale‚Äìand I haven‚Äôt met a small company that doesn‚Äôt want to be a big company‚Äìand they want to operate at scale in a really cost-effective way, ***Teradata is a better choice than Snowflake.‚Äù***

He goes a step further

>‚ÄúWe have differentiation that we think is ***four or five years ahead where Snowflake*** \[is\] in terms of things like workload management and data governance and some of the core, deep SQL engine capabilities that we have in our product that just aren‚Äôt replicated inside Snowflake,‚Äù

And the finale

>‚ÄúWhen we see customers making that transition, making that migration to cloud, they‚Äôve not been able to get the same level of performance and scale, either from the native cloud providers or the likes of Snowflake, in terms of just operating at that level of scale and consistency,‚Äù McMillan says. ‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs really interesting as we double down on the \[cloud\] message and we‚Äôve taken it back to ***customers who may have moved off Teradata and tried these cloud providers, we‚Äôre seeing those workloads start to come back to Teradata in the cloud***.‚Äù

**\*\*\*\*\* IN OTHER WORDS, MCMILLAN SUGGESTS THAT TDC IS STEALING CUSTOMERS BACK FROM SNOWFLAKE. THIS IS HUGE. (LINK BELOW) \*\*\*\*\***

Gartner also suggests that Teradata Vantage is superior to Snowflake in every use case:

* Gartner scored Teradata higher than Snowflake in every use case of its Cloud Database Management Systems
   * [https://www.teradata.com/Resources/Analyst-Reports/2020-Gartner-Capabilities-for-Cloud-DBMS-Analytical-Use-Cases](https://www.teradata.com/Resources/Analyst-Reports/2020-Gartner-Capabilities-for-Cloud-DBMS-Analytical-Use-Cases)
* Teradata Vantage was listed as a market leader ahead of snowflake in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems:

&#x200B;

**Valuation**

*Snowflake (SNOW)*

* Snowflake IPO‚Äôd in 2020 at an \~$80 billion valuation. They claim that they are chasing an $80 billion end market (annually), which has people excited, and rightfully so - this is a pretty exciting time for cloud-based data analytics.
* In the trailing 4 quarters, Snowflake posted $480 million in revenues. The stock trades at $300, or an $80 billion market cap. This implies a \~160x price-to-sales ratio (which is frankly ridiculous imo).
* During its first earnings call, SNOW reported 119% revenue growth

*Teradata (TDC)*

* As of close (2/8/21), TDC was a $5.3 billion company.
* In its earnings report last week, TDC reported that its emerging public cloud business reached $106 million in annual recurring revenues, up 165% from a year prior...this is ape shit growth. The type that rustles people‚Äôs jimmies.
* TDC is guiding for another 160% increase in Q1 2021, and a 100% increase in FY 2021.
* In total TDC reported $1.4 billion of recurring revenue, most of this is the legacy business.
* Before the earnings announcement, which caught Wall Street/Snowflake investors off guard, TDC was valued at $2.7 billion - so it‚Äôs fair to say this is what the legacy business is worth. This is your valuation floor.
* At 160x revenues (what Snowflake is being valued at), TDC‚Äôs public cloud business is worth $17 billion. I‚Äôd also point out (again) that TDC is a 40-year innovator here and is rated higher than Snowflake by Gartner in all use-case categories.
* Now, I think it‚Äôs fair to say that in growing the cloud business, TDC is going to convert legacy customers from the on-prem solution to the public cloud solution. If it converts another $100 million of its $1.5 billion to the cloud biz, that‚Äôs another $17 billion valuation. Now we‚Äôre looking at a $34 billion business.
* 34 billion / 5.3 billion = 6.4x upside

**Price Targets**

* Base case: $7 billion ($64 stock price). This is below JMP‚Äôs recent price target ($70). At $7 billion, TDC‚Äôs cloud biz would be valued at $4.3 billion (43x revenues, or 75% lower than SNOW's valuation).
* Bull case: $17 billion ($155 stock price). At this level, TDC‚Äôs public cloud biz would be valued at 170x revenues (same as SNOW).
* Moon case: $34 billion ($300+ stock price). At this price, TDC‚Äôs public cloud biz would get the same valuation as SNOW, but we would also value another $100 million of revenues at 170x revenues, which would represent future conversions from the company‚Äôs existing legacy customer base to the cloud-native solution.

**Near-term catalysts**

* Recent earnings results shocked investors in a positive way, but not all of the gains have been made. It takes the average buyside investor 2 weeks to complete DD, so we're still getting ahead of the big money here.
* TDC has 20% short interest, so 1 in 5 shares are sold short. These shorts are going to cover ASAP because the recent earnings report was nothing short of transformative. TDC never broke out its cloud-based annual recurring revenues until last week - this basically killed the short thesis and turned TDC from a deep value stock into an aggressive cloud-based saas business overnight.
* People are realizing that TDC was a hidden gem and is the cheapest way to play the parabolic growth market of cloud-based data warehousing/analytics. (see yesterday's Barron‚Äôs [article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/teradata-rally-continues-as-investors-discover-a-cheap-cloud-software-play-51612823248?siteid=yhoof2))
* Given the massive valuation spread between SNOW and TDC, and the apparent technological superiority of TDC, we could be on the right side of a popular hedge fund pair trade (long TDC, short SNOW). This wouldn't be a bad trade if you guys want some risk-adjusted tendies

&#x200B;

**2/11/2021 Update**: For those that need to focus on a valuation floor, try and look at TDC as a sum of the parts:

We know the legacy business is worth $3 billion. TDC was a $3 billion stock before management broke out the cloud revenues last week. 

So depending on how much you think the cloud business is worth, here is what the stock is worth

$47 per share or $5.1 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 20x sales)     

$66 per share or $7.2 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $4.2 billion (TDC Cloud @ 40x sales)     

$76 per share or $8.3 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $5.3 billion (TDC Cloud @ 60x sales)     

$105 per share or $11.5 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $8.5 billion (TDC Cloud @ 80x sales)     

$125 per share or $13.5 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $10.6 billion (TDC Cloud @ 100x sales)     

$190 per share or $21 billion = $3 billion (legacy TDC) + $18 billion (TDC Cloud @ 170x sales)     

&#x200B;

Compare that to other somewhat related cloud stocks: SNOW (170x), MDB (43x), FSLY (50x),  DDOG (60x).

So if you value the cloud biz at less than half of the cheapest above peer (21.5x), then the stock is worth $48. If it's valued at the same level as the cheapest peer (MDB @ 43x) then we're looking at a $70 stock.  

Hang in there and be patient.

Robinhood was calling my account a Margin account when I never had that enabled,490,lfugw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfugw9/robinhood_was_calling_my_account_a_margin_account/,185,1612873385.0,"I had some issues with my Robinhood to Fidelity rollover, (even as a longtime fidelity customer for Pre-tax and Roth accounts) so after spending a really really REEEEALLY long time on hold to get to the right rep at Fidelity they mentioned my account was transferred as a margin account by Robinhood, which was largely contributing to the issues. 

I have NEVER had margin enabled on my account. I didn‚Äôt trade options there, everything was pre-funded with cash from my bank account.

Extraordinary popular delusions and the madness of crowds,99,lfu7mj,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfu7mj/extraordinary_popular_delusions_and_the_madness/,144,1612872480.0,"The title of Charles MacKay‚Äôs book keeps echoing in my head as I watch the GME crowd continue to desperately milk what‚Äôs left of probably the best trade this century. A trade that should have been closed for 1000% profit 2 weeks ago. A beautiful trade in it‚Äôs sheer naked autism that has transformed itself into one of the most grotesque, greed fueled market delusions I have ever witnessed.

It‚Äôs become increasingly hard to stand by and watch tens of thousands of people, most of them with little to no experience trading or investing shout into an echo chamber of disinformation, the likes of which hasn‚Äôt been seen since Trump convinced his supporters to storm the Capitol in desperate attempts to overturn a lost election. While others, that actually know better and understand what a bubble is, ignore their better instincts and continue to buy and hold a stock out of spite for an invisible enemy.

I feel like I may have played a VERY small part in this with my CNBC open letter than went viral on twitter and helped turn our beloved gambling ring into a political movement. As one retard here put it, ‚Äúthis is not Occupy Wall St. This is Wallstreetbets, we fucking love Wall St.‚Äù So with that said I‚Äôm making a last ditch effort to hopefully wake people up and correct posts that are rife with outright false claims that are passing as DD.

People claiming that hedge funds are using options illegally to cover short positions deserve to be fucked in the street in front of the NYSE. There is nothing illegal about using options to neutralize portfolio risk. Everyone can do this, including you. Every brokerage lists this as a synthetic stock position under their ‚Äòhow to use options‚Äô section. 

People claiming ‚ÄúsHoRtS hAvEn‚ÄôT cOvErEd YeT‚Äù despite data released by the exchanges and S3 short interest data are also repeating outright lies and also need to have their butthole fisted by Warren Buffet.

On a final note, I‚Äôm going to leave the 5 stages of bubbles here. Let me know if you recognize any of these.

**1. Displacement**

A displacement occurs when investors get enamored by a trade.

**2. Boom**

Prices rise slowly at first, following a displacement, but then gain [momentum](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/momentum.asp) as more and more participants enter the market, setting the stage for the boom phase. During this phase, the asset in question (GME) attracts widespread media coverage. Fear of missing out on what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity spurs more speculation, drawing an increasing number of investors and traders into the fold.

**3. Euphoria**

During this phase, caution is thrown to the wind, as asset prices skyrocket. Valuations reach extreme levels during this phase as new valuation measures and [metrics](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/metrics.asp) are touted to justify the relentless rise, and the [""greater fool"" theory](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/greaterfooltheory.asp)‚Äîthe idea that no matter how prices go, there will always be a market of buyers willing to pay more‚Äîplays out everywhere. For example, at the peak of the Japanese real estate bubble in 1989, land in Tokyo sold for as much as $139,000 per square foot or more than 350 times the value of Manhattan property.Ôªø Similarly, at the height of the [internet bubble](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/internet-bubble.asp) in March 2000, the combined value of all technology stocks on the [Nasdaq](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nasdaq.asp) was higher than the GDP of most nations.

**4. Profit-Taking**

In this phase, the [smart money](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-money.asp)‚Äîheeding the warning signs that the bubble is about at its bursting point‚Äîstarts selling positions and taking profits. But estimating the exact time when a bubble is due to collapse can be a difficult exercise because, as economist [John Maynard Keynes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/j/john_maynard_keynes.asp) put it, ""the markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

**5. Panic**

It only takes a relatively minor event to prick a bubble, but once it is pricked, the bubble cannot inflate again. In the panic stage, asset prices reverse course and descend as rapidly as they had ascended. Investors and speculators, faced with [margin calls](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/margincall.asp) and plunging values of their holdings, now want to liquidate at any price. As supply overwhelms demand, asset prices slide sharply. One of the most vivid examples of global panic in financial markets occurred in October 2008, weeks after [Lehman Brothers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lehman-brothers.asp) declared bankruptcy and Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and AIG almost collapsed. The S&P 500 plunged almost 17% that month, its ninth-worst monthly performance. In that single month, global equity markets lost a staggering $9.3 trillion of 22% of their combined market capitalization.

GME is turning what was a good idea into something resembling a 2007 toxic mortgage backed security. For those that bought under $40, well played, you did good. For those that bought over $300 and are still holding. Congrats, you just played yourself and have brought shame to your family, your village and all of China.",2021-02-09 12:08:00

FREE MONEY ALERT [5]: ON Semiconductor ($ON)- 40C EXP 4/16,1078,lfttp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfttp8/free_money_alert_5_on_semiconductor_on_40c_exp_416/,384,1612871189.0,"Not usually one for betting on all time highs, but ON provides extremely well priced options despite its current upward trend and momentum.

The biggest thing with ON is institutional ownership. So if you don‚Äôt want to take my word for it, take the over ten-billion down that vanguard, fidelity, Blackrock and a number of large brokers collectively have on this company. 

I‚Äôm a big fan of Hassane, this dude is making some moves to better position the company marginally to capitalize on the majorly emerging EV, Alternative Energy, Aerospace, and 5G markets. With demand currently outweighing supply, semiconductors whether ON or not will be strong investments, and are key to most alternative energy methods, so both markets will grow and evolve in tandem with each other. 

ON in comparison to the other semi stocks is much lower priced, and with institutions holding a majority of the float, a large amount of 2023 convertibles, and still increasing their share positions, once a majority of the general public moves to semi‚Äôs it will explode similar to PLUG power, which was a near identical situation. Although there may be some convertibles causing a degree of share dilution, with the increases in broader market investment the impact should be fairly small. 

Most importantly to all of this the options are cheap as absolute shit. I believe we are going to see a large spike in Theta value by April, making calls now a much better deal then the near future. You can get ATM contracts for $250, meaning it only has to cross 42.5 by April to break even, which is a fucking joke, and what I‚Äôd call a great options deal. 

Note: I don‚Äôt provide sell points, so don‚Äôt ask. Every post I‚Äôve made provides the opportunity to make money, it won‚Äôt change with ON, don‚Äôt be to greedy, and take your free money once it‚Äôs there.",2021-02-09 11:46:29
I believe Qualcomm will recover,94,lftq2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lftq2y/i_believe_qualcomm_will_recover/,55,1612870853.0,"This is not financial advice. This is my first DD so please leave feedback. 


I believe Qualcomm has been brutally oversold. I expect a large rebound in the following months. 

Following their [most recent earnings report Q1 2021](https://investor.qualcomm.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001728949-21-000022/0001728949-21-000022.pdf) on the 4th of February their stock dropped 10% in 2 days. However, their earning report was strong and they maintain confidence that they will have a strong Q2 earnings too with an EPS of $1.65 (analysts were expecting an EPS of $1.57). The Q1 ER had an EPS of $2.17 per diluted share which is more than double their Q1 2020 $0.99 EPS. Although their ER beating high estimates of $8 billion in sales by an extra $200 million, [their licensing division brought in $1.35 billion of an estimated $1.43 billion.](https://www.barrons.com/articles/qualcomm-stock-earnings-chips-apple-51612390489) Their equipment and services division brought in $6.440 billion. They had an operating income of 2.5 billion.


Qcom has a healthy balance sheet with $7 billion in cash and very little short term debt. They do have $15 billion of long term doubt, which would be entirely covered by their cash, accounts receivable, and inventory. They can chip away at this debt slowly in this low interest period whilst focusing on R&D.


All sounds good, so why did the stock tumble so bad? I‚Äôve looked at different sources and have read that business analysts are worried about the limited manufacturing capacity across the semiconductor industry. However, I believe this is bullish. With demand higher than supply, it allows for the flexibility in price and larger profits whilst reinvesting back into manufacturing. Furthermore, I do not believe the dip is for this reason as other US chip producers such as Broadcom, Nvidia and the likes also are experiencing the same chip shortage and their stocks have not dipped in the same way. AMD has dipped in a similar way after beating earnings in true fashion and is showing signs of recovery which makes me bullish of a rebound. 

 It is possible the sell off may be due to [citi downgrading their PT to $165 from $194.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-stock-gets-a-downgrade-at-citi-after-earnings-2021-02-04) This is still higher than the current price by a bit but is slightly more bearish. Qualcomm has 77% of shares held by institutions, so you‚Äôd expect less volatility considering recently they have been loading up on shares, however, this data is prior to earnings. Updated figures on institutional holding reports are filed within 45 days after calendar quarter end - the 21st of March. [The most credible reason for the dip may be due to analysts having higher forecasts for the licensing division, however, I do believe the reaction has been very disproportionate especially when following EPS for the next quarter remains strong.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/02/04/why-qualcomm-stock-is-falling-today/)

RKT will achieve this the same way Amazon became the powerhouse of e-commerce and that is through their unique culture.

Both AMZN and RKT have powerful cultures that are built around  ‚Äúshocking rules"" ‚Äî rituals and practices that are memorable, and so bizarre, that people inside the organization encounter almost daily, and that people who hear about them wonder why they are necessary.

My second DD will be devoted to RKT's shocking rules and their one-of-a-kind culture. RKT DD Part III will focus on Rocket's vision to make Detroit the fintech capital of the world by doing much more than just writing loans.

But for my first DD I want to address the elephant in the room: RkT StOcK HaSn'T DoNe ShIt.

Yes you drooling shit-for-brain autists are correct, RKT has performed very poorly in a market where nearly every company is hitting all time highs.... But what you pea-brained dip shits don't understand is that you are believing exactly what the institutions want you to believe: which is that RKT isn't a buy. When in reality, RKT is a gold mine and the fat cat tutes know it.

RKT DD Part 1 will explain the market manipulation RKT is experiencing, how it works, who is doing it and why they are doing it. I will also discuss another successful company that experienced this in 2012 and how I believe RKT will have a similar outcome as the company I mention.

It may be safer to buy RKT shares and RKT calls that expire in June or later. You guys will make money on this trade trust me - just don‚Äôt be greedy and go for weeklies; making money off those is far from guaranteed.

Double edit: with over 40 percent short interest, a $1B buyback (that cuts RKT‚Äôs float in half) zero insider selling and potential catalysts - RKT could easily squeeze into the $50s in the near term if the stars align. And if it doesn‚Äôt squeeze, this shit is still going to melt up. You‚Äôre not investing in fucking bed bath and beyond here.",2021-02-09 10:21:12
"Why I'll never stop buying GME, and why you probably should",2639,lfs22f,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfs22f/why_ill_never_stop_buying_gme_and_why_you/,581,1612865338.0,"When I turned 18, there was a casino about 2 hours away on a reservation that I could get into. We'd get paid on Friday night, head to the gas station near us that would cash a paycheck, pile into my crappy little Ford, then make the drive. We'd get there a little before midnight and everyone had their own game.

The second time we went, one of my friends was hypnotized by the craps table. There were 16 players standing around this sea of green, and every minute or so, you could hear them screaming at the top of their lungs like they just won a million dollars. On the way home that night, I taught him everything I learned from books I'd read about the different bets. ""Smart"" bets where the house edge was only 1.4%, all the way down to the risky ones where the house edge was over 10% (meaning that for every $100 wagered, you should expect to lose $10).

The next time we went, we hung around the table, trying to figure out the right way to bet. It seemed a little complicated, so we tried other games. At the end of the night, I had the last $10 and he asked if he could borrow it to go place a bet. I handed it over, then went to the bathroom in preparation for the ride home. When I finally found him again, he had a stack of chips in front of him. He had been gone for about 5 minutes and already turned $10 into a few hundred. Well, if you can turn 10 into 100, you can turn 100 into 1,000 just as easily. We left empty handed that night, but I'll never forget the rush.

I loved blackjack. I learned how to play at an early age from my uncle, who would always cheat and take my money. He'd say ""I just taught you a very valuable lesson."" He actually taught me two: 1) if you play against a casino, you may have a good night and win thousands of dollars, but if you keep going back, you'll eventually have nothing left. 2) My uncle was a scumbag who continually cheated and took my money, then told the family I was a poor sport and they couldn't understand why I hated doing anything with him. One of my earliest memories at the casino was running $100 at the blackjack table into $3000, which is more than I made in a month of bussing tables. I went home, paid my rent and blew the rest on useless things I can't even remember.

What does any of this have to do with $GME? Well I'm still chasing the same high as I was when I was 18. I don't go to the casino anymore, but I've got something even better on my computer. I bought $2k worth of weeklies on Jan 25. Before everything crashed, they were worth over $100k, more than enough to fix most of the problems I've caused in my life. BUT, I was still standing around that craps table. The roller had just made his 30th point in a row, $GME was on fire and couldn't possibly roll a 7! I put my 2k back in my pocket and shoved the rest on the pass line. A few minutes later, the croupier inevitably yells ""7 out!"" and just like that, I'm back to nothing.

Now I do what every moron around the table does. You reach back into your pocket, pull out the 2k and make a deal with your maker. ""Just let it happen one more time. I won't be greedy THIS time and I'll stop when I hit 50k."" I stop looking at the smart bets and start eyeing the center of the table, where hard ways are paying 10:1. Yeah, that'll be how I get back to 50k. A couple of those in a row and I can put a down payment on a house. 5 minutes later, I'm on my way out to the car and I feel like I've been punched in the gut. Again.

Every one of you in this subreddit is another person sitting at the casino. Everyone has their game. The people holding $GME stonks right now? You're playing baccarat. If you've never heard of it, it's what James Bond plays in the old movies. It's about the most boring thing you can do. Two hands are dealt and you're betting on which one wins before anything happens. There's no actual skill and it's the same thing as betting heads or tails, while losing 1% of your bet every time.

The people who cashed out and picked something else like $AMC or $BB? Those are the slot players. You had a big hit and now you're going to switch machines because the other ones are ""due"". You're looking for the exact same magic, thinking there was something smart in your play, when it was really just dumb luck in timing.

The people saying ""If Daddy Elon or Cowboy Cuban gets in, we can trigger a squeeze!"" You're the guy who spent too much money in the first 20 minutes of the trip and now you're begging everyone else for a loan.

Tldr: Nothing is happening with $GME. Stop saying ""tomorrow is the day."" Billionaires are not coming to bail you out. If institutional investors come in, they're waiting for this constant downhill slide to end at where the stock belongs, probably around $20. You can't trigger shit by holding. The HFs will outlast you.

What is HUYA?

HUYA Inc. operates live game streaming platforms in China. Its platforms enable broadcasters and viewers to interact during live streaming (emotes, donations, subs). Its live streaming content covers a library of games, including mobile, PC, and console games; and other entertainment genres, such as talent shows, anime, outdoor activities, live chats, online theatre, and other genres. The company operates Nimo TV, a game live streaming platform primarily in Southeast Asia and Latin America. It also provides online advertising and marketing services. In addition, the company provides software development and Internet value added services. As of December 31, 2019, its live streaming content covered approximately 3,800 games. The company was founded in 2014 and is headquartered in Guangzhou, the People‚Äôs Republic of China. HUYA Inc. is a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings Limited.

&#x200B;

* With Tencent's backing, Huya is merging with the second largest game streamer in China, DouYu (estimated 80% market share behemoth post merger).
* Huya is still growing strongly on its own with or without said merger.
* 31x 2020 forward earnings does not seem too expensive for a company currently showing strong growth in sales and earnings, while being the game live-streaming leader in China.
* News broke out that China has anti-trust concerns with said merger between Huya and DouYu. The 8.5% drop today happened swiftly and the stock price is hovering above the 20 SMA.

$SKLZ is the only straight play on an American company with online gaming esports streaming potential. Their website is basically yahoo games from early 2000s. Recent NFL multi year contract with no mobile product yet. The only possible reason why valuations like this exist is their profit margins on their Bingo, Pool, Solitaire... yahoo 2000s games. Careful with this one as once NFL takes a cut from the licensing agreement the margins won't be so gravy. Otherwise this is a house of cards on 15.83B valuation based on 162M revenue grossing 153M. Great profit margins, but valuation is beyond insane with no NFL mobile app. For the smooth brains, you need to multiply 162M x 100 to even get close to the 15.83B valuation.

**Conclusion**

Huya trades under 4x revenue (Revenue **1.53B |** Market Cap  **5.77B)**  for being a leader in online esports streaming in the most populous country with the most gamers in the world. Where else can you find such a gem in this market? The 8.5% drop today from anti-trust concerns is simply smoke and mirrors. With or without the merger between Huya and DouYU this stock is a buy at the current valuation. China and anti-trust concerns are a joke. BABA had anti-trust concerns in Dec 2020 for not reporting prior takeovers and were fined $75k. BABA is valued at 710.47B.

A scientist chick called Mary Johnson at labome? (some weird science organization) analyzed how many science papers cited using Bio-rad / other suppliers to see what PCR equipment labs should buy.

*\*Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor. This is not investment advice. All information stated in this post is my own opinion, and some information may be unknowingly inaccurate or outdated. Please do your own due diligence before investing your money. I currently hold a long position on various Altria LEAPs.\**

  


 Nicotine products have been in continuous use in North America for thousands of years [\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_tobacco). Upon the arrival of the Spanish to the New World, tobacco use spread rapidly throughout the globe, becoming hugely popular not only across Europe, but also in far-flung Asia and the Ottoman Empire. The only comparable product to conquer the world so thoroughly is the ubiquitous, similarly addictive, mighty coffee bean.

 By the 1900's, smoking had become a huge commercial enterprise. Glitz and glam surrounded the tobacco industry. All of your Grandmother's favorite actors smoked [\[2\]](https://www.dw.com/en/famous-smokers-on-screen/g-19021895). Many high schools had smoking lounges for the students (of course, your Nana still regularly snuck out behind the bleachers to have a private puff with the quarterback). Nicotine use was a normal and accepted part of life.

We are all, of course, familiar with the rest of the story. Studies came out showing just how damaging cigarette usage was on the human body. Campaigns were begun, laws were enacted, and Big Tobacco became Public Enemy #1 [\[3\]](https://www.thetruth.com/about-truth)

Fast forward to today. For the past few decades, despite decreasing cigarette volumes, the tobacco industry has remained immensely profitable. Big players in the cigarette industry have been able to compensate for declining cigarette volumes by raising prices. Cash flows from cigarette smoking have never been higher. Yet looking at the stock market performance of the tobacco industry over the past 5 years, you would think that the industry was on life support.

No company has lately fared worse than Altria ($MO). Despite growing income at a 5.9% CAGR since 2017 amid a backdrop of stabilizing declines in cigarette consumption [\[4\]](https://s25.q4cdn.com/409251670/files/doc_presentations/2021/01/28/Presentation.pdf), the company's stock remains 45% off its 2017 high. Much of the underperformance can be attributed to investors losing confidence in the company's management after a series of questionable investment decisions, including taking a 35% stake in JUUL, a 45% stake in Chronos (a Canadian marijuana company), and a 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch.

These investments have performed poorly over the past few years. High-profile teen deaths from illicit THC vaping products were widely linked to JUUL usage by our sensationalist media [\[5\]](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/e-cigarrettes-vaping-lung-injuries-deaths-top-science-stories-2019-yir), causing Altria to write-down its initial $12B investment in JUUL to a value of only \~$2B today. The bubble in the marijuana stock market popped in 2018, causing a 30% reduction in the value of Altria's Chronos stake. And the rise of the craft beer industry has continued to weigh on the profitability of Anheuser-Busch.

Despite the short-term pitfalls, I will argue that it is reasonable to believe that Altria has positioned itself very well for the future. And with all of these factors weighing down the stock over the past few years, I believe $MO is ripe for a turnaround.

**I have a 2023 price target for $MO of $90 which, given the low IV Altria enjoys, implies a 30x (3,000%) return on MO Jan 2023 65c LEAPs.**

My thesis relies on four key beliefs:

&amp;amp;#x200B;

1. The company's core business is under-valued
2. Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes
3. Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized
4. Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO

**1) The Company's core business is under-valued**

Altria enjoys a stunningly low forward P/E of 8.7 and a stunningly high dividend yield of 8.1% [\[6\]](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MO). Various online discounted cash flow analyses of Altria give it an intrinsic value between $62-$72 [\[7\]](https://www.stock-analysis-on.net/NYSE/Company/Altria-Group-Inc/DCF/Present-Value-of-FCFF) [\[8\]](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/food-beverage-tobacco/nyse-mo/altria-group/news/are-investors-undervaluing-altria-group-inc-nysemo-by-44). These analyses are very conservative in that they only take into account Altria's current business, which is predominantly smokeable tobacco products.

There are also bright spots in Altria's miscellaneous businesses that these DCF models don't account for, such as the fast-growing ""on!"" line of nicotine pouches, or the likely reinstatement of Anheuser-Busch's dividend after it was paused last year due to Covid.

We'll ignore these bright spots for now and give Altria's core business a conservative price target of $65.

**2) Vaping will see a resurgence as a less-harmful alternative to cigarettes**

*\*Please note: I am not a doctor. All health claims made in this post reflect only my own opinions.\**

Nicotine has gotten a bad rap in the past 50 years, but on its own there isn't much research I've seen to suggest it's any more dangerous than caffeine. The big problem with nicotine is simply the delivery mechanism. Smoking large amounts of anything is bad for your lungs. Vaping exposes your lungs to far fewer ancillary chemicals in much smaller doses than traditional smoking. For instance, Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease, says about vaping ‚Äúthere‚Äôs almost no doubt that they expose you to fewer toxic chemicals than traditional cigarettes.‚Äù [\[9\]](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/5-truths-you-need-to-know-about-vaping#:~:text=1%3A%20Vaping%20Is%20Less%20Harmful,many%20of%20which%20are%20toxic.)

Altria surveyed the landscape in 2017 and determined that acquiring a stake in JUUL was its best way to position itself for the future. Since then, JUUL's name has been dragged through the mud and associated with many teen deaths. However, these deaths were later determined to be caused by unauthorized THC products unlinked to JUUL [\[10\]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/10/25/cdc-most-people-who-died-vaping-linked-disease-used-products-containing-thc/). JUUL's case for harm reduction in the nicotine space is still intact.

The FTC filed an anti-trust case recently attempting to block Altria's stake in JUUL [\[11\]](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/191-0075/altria-groupjuul-labs-matter). This case is due to be heard this spring. The uncertainty around JUUL's future has weighed on $MO, but in my opinion all outcomes of this case are positive:

1) Altria is forced to divest its stake in JUUL

This is not ideal, but as part of the JUUL acquisition, Altria agreed to not compete in the vaping space against JUUL. If Altria is forced to divest, it can capitalize on the recent decline in the quality and brand value of JUUL (just check out r/juul to see the declining sentiment around the brand) to bring its own high-quality product onto the market.

2) Altria is allowed to keep its stake in JUUL

In this case, Altria can capitalize on JUUL's troubles by acquiring a larger stake in the company at a discount. Altria can then flood JUUL with the cash it needs to help rebuild its quality and brand. This is the ideal case in my opinion, for both JUUL and Altria.

Setting aside JUUL for the moment, Altria has the exclusive rights to distribute in the USA Phillip Morris's FDA-approved IQoS product [\[12\]](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/07/altria-and-philip-morris-iqos-3-device-wins-fda-ap/). This is a ""heat not burn"" product that is more similar to existing cigarettes than vaping, but still reduces the number of harmful chemicals inhaled. This product is already popular in Europe and Japan, and is just beginning to be marketed in the USA. One major advantage of this product is that it produces no smoke, and so may potentially end up being allowed in restaurants, bars, and offices.

**3) Altria is poised to win big if marijuana is federally legalized**

Altria is the one company with the regulatory experience and distribution networks necessary to gain substantial market share in the nascent marijuana industry. Altria has been quietly filing patent after patent for THC and CBD vaping devices [\[13\]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisroberts/2020/10/02/tobacco-giant-altria-is-securing-technology-in-new-frontier-marijuana/). In fact, people in the fledgling marijuana industry are so worried about Altria's entry into the market that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, when speaking about his upcoming federal legalization bill, recently said ""I don‚Äôt want to see these big tobacco companies coming in and shoving everyone out"" [\[14\]](https://mjbizdaily.com/senate-leader-chuck-schumer-pushing-federal-marijuana-legalization/). (Note however that, while this position may play well with Senator Schumer's base for now, having a marijuana industry that is run by well-established and responsible companies is ultimately the best outcome for public health, and so it is unlikely that any steps will be taken to bar Altria from competing in the free market of marijuana products).

**4) Michael Burry's Scion Asset Management is heavily invested in $MO**

Would this really be WallStreetBets if I didn't mention Michael Burry? Burry's fund Scion Asset Management had 5% of its portfolio in $MO as of Q3 2020, making Altria its 13th largest holding \[\[15\]([https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM](https://dataroma.com/m/holdings.php?m=SAM)). For context, this is about half the weight that Michael Burry's fund had in GameStop during the same quarter.

If nothing else, this is a good sanity check on the analysis here.

**Summary**

In summary, it's likely that the true value of Altria's core business is closer to $65 than the current price of $43. Add on top of that the potential for success in the vaping category, and the potential for growth into the marijuana market, and it is easy to see $MO adding an additional 20-30B in market cap to reach a price of $90 by 2023.

IV for 2023 LEAPs sits at \~20%. MO Jan 2023 65c's are currently priced at $0.77. If Altria reaches $90 by 2023, these options will be worth at least $25. This would represent a &amp;gt;3,100% return.

For this reason, I believe that Altria LEAPs represent a unique opportunity for asymmetric upside. Please let me know your thoughts below, I'd appreciate counter-arguments that highlight any flaws in the reasoning outlined above.",2021-02-09 08:37:14

QANON/GME Comparisons and How We Learned to Love the Stock.,487,lfpzz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpzz9/qanongme_comparisons_and_how_we_learned_to_love/,433,1612858805.0,"A conspiracy literally occurred to restrict GME buy-side, and this completely shifted momentum and stopped the share-price from exploding.

So I don't really understand people comparing this to other conspiracies that were never supported by data but only belief. Like, I've really noticed a lot of people comparing GME holders with QANON/supporters and Capitol-rioters. It's a psychological tactic to gaslight and paint people who 'just like a stock' as criminals who lamely attempted to overthrow the fuckin' US government.

Think about that juxta-fuckin-position.

You know why they make this comparison?

Because GME holders almost overthrew the US financial system.

The difference, my educated degenerates (remember we're so poor because we're so educated) is that we used free speech to interact in the marketplace in a completely democratic way.

So they must defile us; turn us into the very mob that stupidly supports them.

There's a lot of data suggesting that retail got fucked by some pretty unprecedented (not to mention illegal) forms of manipulation that somehow just happened to get some wealthy hedge funds out of (for now) a pretty tight squeeze.

THAT IS WHY WE HOLD.

We hold because we like the stock. I just really like the stock. That's my right as a wage-earner living in a capitalist society.

Unless we live within the realm of the USSA Empire.

Which we do.

Making my rights negotiable (for a price).

Is it my fault hedge funds have put themselves in an untenable situation; basically the equivalent of the synthetic-CDO fiasco that nearly brought capitalism to a halt in 2007/08?

It's not my fault, actually. 

They are humans. They call themselves men. They can face the consequences.

So the QANON/Capitol Riots comparison breaks down completely and honestly it's sort of become this bizarre talking point that people invoke (but never explain!) to deride the GME hype. Like ‚Äì you're doing exactly what you accuse others of; it's a bit fascinating.

By all means go ahead and deride ‚Äì but make it sensible.",2021-02-09 08:20:05
"There‚Äôs a lot of misinformation about what everything means (cost to borrow, 13G filings etc)",770,lfpkl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfpkl9/theres_a_lot_of_misinformation_about_what/,157,1612857533.0,"Hello all,

So reading the GME thread there‚Äôs a lot of bad information on both sides, the astronauts and the üåàüêª‚Äôs. Hopefully this can clear up some of the questions the new guys have. 

I am not a financial advisor or a professional trader. I have done plenty of research and will update with new questions as asked or corrections if proven wrong. 

13G filings - 
So we are seeing new 13G filings by institutional investors. What does this mean? 

I can tell you with 99% certainty they aren‚Äôt buying. This stock was under $20 a couple months ago with no fundamental changes. Only a passion investor would pay ‚Äúinflated‚Äù prices for a stock. If we maintain the $60 level over a period of time you could see it being bought again, but right now no one is touching it.  

I will say most will be institutional selling. These funds have this stock in a basket with other stocks. As an example let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs 3% if the basket. As the stock raises 1446% this stock is now very overweight leaving the fund over exposed. Suddenly this is 15% of a particular basket! So they sell down the stock to maintain the predetermined risk exposure. 

If the stock falls they will buy to maintain the proper level. This isn‚Äôt done in real time, could take months possibly even next year after the dust settles. 

This is why ETFs don‚Äôt go parabolic and are considered ‚Äúsafe‚Äù they hedge and manage risk. 

Edit: I left out the important part! To see if it was buy or sell look at the firms previous 13G it tells you their position held at that time and compare with the newest one. That will tell you the change. 

Shares available to borrow-

As stated above, a lot of institutions have sold so you will see more shares available. The cost to borrow is low right now, that‚Äôs because the share price is dropping. Share price, volatility, and number available all are taken into account when the cost to borrow is set. BUT the share price and volatility are the most important. If it‚Äôs raising at 10%+ a day the cost to borrow goes up. Why? Because there‚Äôs more risk of losing money shorting the stock, so the broker charges more (like banks do) as they are ultimately responsible. If it‚Äôs moving down and you want to short it, that seems like a pretty good bet with low risk so the interest rate is low. 

The shares available does not directly reflect the short interest especially when institutional investors are selling 25% or better of their positions. 


Current SI -

I would not be surprised to see SI still above 70%. Remember, 30% is very high. 

BUT something important to remember is current short sellers are not in the same position as short sellers from December. Let me explain. 

December short sellers were in their positions from no more than $35 per share. That means when the stock price hit $35 every short seller was under water. So some were margin called and Hf to cover positions. Driving the cost up. BUT there were new shorts who couldn‚Äôt believe it would maintain $100 so they shorted it and got called further driving the cost up etc.. See at each entry point new shorts would jump in taking the place of the lower shorts. 

The stock price touched $500 in premarket. These shorts in the $400s are going to be hard to get margin called. You HAVE to exceed $500 for these boys to lose money. Same with $350,300,250.. and finally $100. These guys have room to breath and made a shit ton of money on the way down. These are probably the hedge fund that was involved on the way up by the way (hedge funds love fucking other hedge funds) we didn‚Äôt trigger this thing alone. We don‚Äôt have that kind of capital here. Hell only half the sub was even in this play at the start. And back then we weren‚Äôt nearly this big and most not even active! 

There will be reports tomorrow after hours. Remember that report is outdated, just something to keep in mind. So take good and bad information with a grain of salt. 

Is this over? - 

Who fucking knows, I hope not! But this play is a lot harder than it was a month ago. This was always sheer mechanics of the high short percentage and low short position entry point. (Was a value play too, the stock was fundamentally undervalued). I‚Äôm rooting for y‚Äôall but mechanically it‚Äôs a lot harder to trigger. 

This isn‚Äôt financial advice just spreading information as I see it happening to help some of the new guys be informed on what all this information going around means. Not meant to be either bullish or bearish. But I am rooting for you retards.",2021-02-09 07:58:53

"We don't actually KNOW whether or not ""the rules were changed"" to screw over retail investors",61,lfom6m,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfom6m/we_dont_actually_know_whether_or_not_the_rules/,62,1612854710.0,"Obviously a real (not a bullshit quick glance) investigation needs to be done to find out exactly what went on, but, based on the information that has been provided so far, no ""rules"" were changed:

\- DTCC has an algorithm in place, that was in place long before GME, to increase margin requirements based on volatility (they claim). If this is true, then this ""rule"" already existed prior to GME, and it was enforced, not changed.

\- Robinhood had X amount of available liquidity prior to GME, but they needed more than X in order to allow their clients to purchase meme stocks after DTCC increased margin. Unless RH decided to reduce their liquidity just before GME, then this ""rule"" was already in place as well.

Again, an investigation is needed but this all sounds completely plausible. If it's true, then no rules were changed to screw over the retail investor. Plus, everyone could have not been using a broker with a crayon interface and been using a big boy broker that charges these things called ""commissions"".

Is it really that hard to believe that a completely free broker wouldn't have enough liquidity to handle a historic unprecedented moment in the market? Many are new here, so here's some history you might not be aware of:

\- Robinhood had to change their rules because 1R0NYMAN found a loophole where he cost RH $53k

\- Robinhood had another loophole where people were able to get infinite margin

\- Remember the big covid crash early 2020? RH was offline the entire trading day when it first happened. They were offline most of the 2nd trading day as well.

Is it really that hard to believe a brokerage with this kind of history simply fucked up, and Vlad didn't want to admit to it on tv?",2021-02-09 07:11:50

And yet, some of you still held...  If it makes you feel any better, you were always going to be the bagholder.  It's a zero-sum game.  Every dollar someone makes is a dollar taken from someone else.  If you didn't sell at over $400 when the brokers called the top, then you weren't going to sell at $1,000, or you would have at least bought back in.

I have made huge gains over the course of my time on this sub, upwards of $400,000. I consider myself a heavy weight investor ready to put in my next bet. I feel this is important so you can understand the weight of my conviction I have for this company.

**Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is a company that prides itself in being one of the leading providers of clean fuel for the transportation market in North America. 

As of right now they are currently involved in:

* Regional Fleets of Trucks

* Commercial Airlines

* Public Transit

* Construction Vehicles

* Ships/Cargo Boats/Vessels/Cruise Lines

Undervalued. At it's current price of $17 a share and 600% price movement over the last 3 months, it's a no brainer that this will continue to climb this year. [3 month graph](https://imgur.com/BNB6mnx) üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Financials**

* Market Cap - 2.94B

* P/E Ratio - 79.62 

* Cash on Hand - 96 million

What causes a companies value to go up? The potential for future catalysts. With Biden in presidency, CLNE is a huge candidate for getting a large piece of the clean energy stimulus and providing eco friendly alternatives across North America. It's reign has just begun.  



**Argument #2**

Biden plans to pump $2 trillion into clean energy alternatives. He plans on creating 10 million jobs in clean energy sectors. He's only been in office since January 20th, the momentum will pick up shortly don't miss the rocket. If you read [President Biden's Plan to build a sustainable clean energy future](https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/) you will immediately understand why this is one of the clearest investments to make right now

 **TLDR:** Biden will make **far reaching** investments into clean energy transit methods by reducing fuel emissions in public and commercial transit systems.

While Electric Vehicles are definitely the long long long term play.  **Clean Energy Fuels Corp** is the realistic solution in a shorter period of time to achieve Biden's goals.

**Argument #3**

The recent hype and growth of the opportunities in Clean Energy are very apparent with the large stimulus packages including a lot of subsidies for clean energy companies. The company itself has recently been partnering with well-known industry leaders that want to be first-movers in the space to transition to greener consumption of transportation.

The [CEO, Andrew Littlefair](https://imgur.com/eKOQD7Z) owns 0.7% of shares outstanding. Current shares outstanding are 198M, and of this, the CEO himself owns approximately 1.38 million shares. He definitely believes in the company!

**My Price Targets**

I believe the momentum for this company is just beginning. $40 by June, and $65 by end of year are my conservative estimates. Today we saw a 40% price movement because of a deal made with [LA transit bus systems](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-alert%3A-clean-energy-fuels-corp.-adds-30-after-striking-deal-with-la-metro-2021-02-08?amp)

The potential for e-commerce companies, transit systems, airports, shipping companies and trading ports converting to Clean Fuels is a huge game changer and allow for *MANY* more catalysts in the future. The surface has only just been scratched.

\*This post is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment, financial, or other advice.\*

&#x200B;

TLDR: Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) is the #1 nationwide online casino company and the #3 or #4 sports book depending on the state. Short selling, unwarranted institutional wariness of share dilution and the general market focus on sports book instead of online casino has left $RSI grossly undervalued. A massive blow out at Q4 earnings will result in analyst upgrades and a rapid repricing by market makers and institutions seeking exposure to the emerging sector.

&#x200B;

\*\*Overview\*\*

""Sports book is really just kind of a warm up in a lot of ways for an online casino where the real money is made"" - Niccolo De Masi, CEO dMY technologies

&#x200B;

Rush Street Interactive ($RSI) operates the [BetRivers.com](https://betrivers.com) online casino and sports book. They are now fully licensed and operating in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. They own and operate a casino in New York and already have a New York license making them well positioned for liberalization there. They merged with a dMY Technology Group SPAC on Dec. 31st 2020 with 240 million on the balance sheet to spend on growth.

The online casino business is fundamentally more profitable than sports betting because the average value of a casino player is estimated at $600 while a sports book player could be as little as $20. Estimates put the online casino market at DOUBLE the size of the online sports book market and the online casino industry is really just getting started as more states liberalize.

$RSI is expert at new market entry; they have been first to market in Pennsylvania, Illinois, Indiana, and Colorado and even when they aren't first they are capable of capturing market share in competitive markets such as New Jersey. They also have products which women play which accounts for at least half of the market in online casino. The female market is one that the pure sports book plays miss out on.

Also for some fucking reason they operate a casino and sports book in Colombia ([rushbet.co](https://rushbet.co)) and may make large expansions into other parts of south America as legalization continues. This means they have the expertise necessary for global expansion in the future although the states remains their primary focus and growth driver.

&#x200B;

\*\*The Financials and Strategy\*\*

Unlike other companies in the space Rush Street is already profitable in 2020 and has a strong focus on Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). Q3 gross revenue was $71.9 Million. Q4 revenue is going to be a blow out. Combing through state gambling revenue data and breaking that down by market share my estimate is that Q4 revenue could be as high as $120 Million.

Paired with this blow out will be a \*\*guidance raise to $500 Million for 2021\*\*, which is 2/3 of DraftKings 2021 guidance of $750M.

[https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC](https://imgur.com/a/xkfcayC)

&#x200B;

What is striking when compared to $DKNG is that their advertising spend was only a quarter of revenue in Q3 while $DKNG spent 155% of their revenue. This will change as they begin to focus on growth, but it shows they are very good at getting return on ad spend. This company should actually be valued close to $DKNG based on growth potential once guidance is raised.

[https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg](https://imgur.com/a/RQQXtGg)

&#x200B;

Their focus on attracting \*\*female gamers\*\* is also important to their long term growth potential. The sports book plays with cross sells to casino such as $DKNG will not be able to grow through the female demographic in the same way. \*\*This cannot be understated\*\* as one of the major strategic advantages of $RSI.

[https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n](https://imgur.com/a/xzJj26n)

&#x200B;

As I said before I expect their trend of rapid growth to continue for Q4 earnings, certainly going to be a blow out based on looking at state gambling revenue numbers. My estimate is that their revenue will be around 110M for Q4. I also expect guidance to be raised to 500M for 2021 due to strong performance in existing markets and the recently opened Michigan market as well as their sports book launch in Virginia.

[https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh](https://imgur.com/a/ckTqHhh)

&#x200B;

\*\*Short sellers have entered the chat\*\*

The short interest on $RSI sits at 5.08 M shares as of 01/14/21 representing a 30% increase. Now why would a company already valued at 2.8 Billion and with a comparative valuation of 8-10 Billion compared with $DKNG and $PENN be so heavily shorted at such a low market cap? My conclusion is that an institution with 10s of millions to throw at shorting this stock wants to take advantage of fear of share dilution from warrant calling or to establish a better entry prior to earnings.

&#x200B;

\*\*Commander in GILF Cathie Wood is Bullish on the sector\*\*

On Feb. 2nd ARK disclosed that they had purchased 620,300 shares of $DKNG. This is extremely bullish for the sector. I am highly confident that after Q4 earnings ARK will be purchasing shares in $RSI as well due its strategic advantages relative to $DKNG and exposure to the female demographic. For such a small market cap company this will be a major catalyst.

&#x200B;

\*\*Institutions are bullish\*\*

Fidelity has increased their holdings to 14% as of today: [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0001793659/8f10b0d8-a3d2-447c-bc75-87587d0a4670.pdf)

This company knows their target audience and how to appeal to them, likely more 'classic' ambassadors to come to attract even more boomer and Gen X degenerates. Keep in mind these are the gamblers with big money to spend, the average age of an online casino gambler is 42.

This stock has been grossly underpriced due to short selling. The terms of the SPAC deal were not unfavorable and all the insiders held their shares through the merger banking on growth in the market - \*\*management owns 77% of the company\*\*. This is a true value play on a well managed company in an emerging industry with a market size in the hundreds of billions. I plan to hold shares long term.

&#x200B;

I will post a part 2 breaking down their latest S-1 filing and Q4 revenue by state when they release their Q4 earnings date.

BioNano Genomics - Why you should care about it,1421,lfluvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfluvn/bionano_genomics_why_you_should_care_about_it/,396,1612847187.0,"First of all, I'm not a financial advisor and I like certain stocks more than others.

I was skeptical about investing in [BioNano Genomics](https://bionanogenomics.com/products/) after the run-up which saw that share price move from **$0.50 to $10 in two months**. But, I got interested - I read, and I read, and I followed what the scientists were saying, the results of their tech, and I got hooked.

Without going into the science which won't mean much to most of us - it's a company that runs human genome mapping at scale, and allows doctors to detect genetic variants which can lead to new cancer treatments, and a bunch of other cool stuff that reads like science fiction, but is become more and more a reality.

I became a believer after seeing this - they are helping solve children leukemia, for crying out loud:

[Dr. Gordana R. from Children's Hospital Los Angeles Presents Findings That Show Saphyr Detects Druggable Genetic Fusions in Pediatric Acute Leukemias  ...](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com/?qmodStoryID=4789689684773596)

That story is from their [investors website](https://ir.bionanogenomics.com). There are many others.

Analysts are starting to like them more and more, because of the promise of a $100 genome map:

[If analysts raise PT to $15, market is probably gonna take it to $30](https://preview.redd.it/4hecjqm6hbg61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5b0edb1352e0c7e254b4834bffa2a2c1b2d6b979)

There's plenty of speculation on whether or not ARKG is going to take them on, but honestly, I don't really care. People over at r/BNGO seem to love to debate that, but, personally, I really believe that this is going to enable next generation cancer treatments and move the needle in medicine overall, that I plan to HODL this for years, whatever happens.

Finally, here are my positions. It's not much, but I'm working on it. I sold far dated puts to collect cash premium and invest it into shares. I described that here, if you're interested: [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/BNGO/comments/lada1i/selling_bngo_puts_for_shares_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I don't want to speculate about price going to $X in Y months, so I can't suggest any long calls and I don't know if you'll make 10x on this in a month. Probably not, and there's risk here like in anywhere else. Also, I know, this is not r/investing and I should fuck off and take my shit there. That's fine too. I'll just leave this here and people can decide if they want to buy in or not.

$30? Really, $30? Look at it like this, If the Thursday Scare that murdered all the meme stonks for what they were worth, couldn't keep PLTR at your PT, then what makes you think it'll hit it again, with everything behind the stock, contracts getting pumped into Palantir like the hot girl on campus, and ER being right around the corner; not forgetting the shares lockup 3 days later!? 

And note, remember during the Scare Phase last week, they were saying $29/28? Before the Reversal, below to $24 and below? Before that when it tripled in a few months? Catch my drift?

Like the stock, it's interesting that their #'s increase as well, exponentially at that. Analysts are finally starting to budge but they're still stern about those delusional lows. In your eyes, who do you follow? Do you listen to the Citron clown calling for $15 or the Institutes buying in millions of shares at a time?

A lot of these Bearish Fiends finally got their heads out of the sand and now they're claiming the plunge of a lifetime is bound, during a fade off. But not 1 of them seems to mention that PLTR is still up +5% for the day lol. And on top of this, more people than there should be are going nuts because, ""it didn't hit $40, fml"". All this anxiety under a bright green day. GTFOH.

To the Longs with no faith, this type of day is of no shock. [$PLTR](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/PLTR) is without debate, one of the most vastly manipulated and shorted stocks on the market. Understand, Big Daddy Institutions got to squeeze you poor Retailers out, gulp up your shares, and laugh to their fatcat friends as the price skyrockets to new ATH's whilst **YOU GET SCREWED**. This is how it works people, this is how it's always worked. To win this game, you just need to hold on to your shares, buy out for the long term, and stand up to the adversity. When they bend you over for what you're worth, you say NO!!

Quite simply Palantirians and - to noobs - Palantards, remain Long and Hard; we can't be stopped. Palantir is a fantastic company with ground breaking tech that's being appreciated and noticed by more and more companies. Short Volume that can only keep clinging on to life for only so long. MM can hold us down for only so long. It's a stock that has 2 more **Major Catalysts** to go through with an abundance of hype that hasn't checked in yet. The gasoline has been poured, we just need the lighter.

PS: Fuck **Jim ""Once a Shill Always a Shill"" Cramer**. That Indecisive, Bi-Polar Clown. 

PPS: Drop a heart for Mommy Cathie. This women lead me to the promise lands with my poor $800 acc (17 btw) and helped turn it into $2k plus

The Solution to the Robinhood Problem,26,lflob4,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lflob4/the_solution_to_the_robinhood_problem/,20,1612846731.0,"Okay Smoothie Brains, I‚Äôll make this short because I know you apes won‚Äôt read.

Whatever happened with GME and AMC would not be an issue with a digital securities platform. Trades will be settled real-time, no more T + 2. Brokers like RH post collateral because of the risks taken by the clearing house to settle the trade and when there was a run on GME they couldn‚Äôt keep up.  Something like that, I don‚Äôt really understand. It was irresponsible and greedy of them to hide their inability to handle high velocity and volume of trades. With digital securities this disappears. 

Not only that, we will see an eruption of tradeable securities in the marketplace. Any asset or security (i.e. stocks, bonds, mutual funds, ETFs, warrants, real estate, collectibles) will be tradable. You could buy securities that are tethered to real estate in California or New York or to cars like Rally Road does. Any private company can do this, you no longer need an IPO to have investors. And they can offer benefits like discounts and dividends or profit-sharing.

This democratizes markets because you are no longer kept out of the early stages by the rules. You no longer have to depend on a central authority to do their job. You don‚Äôt have to wait on the snail pace of the traditional market and you have the freedom to invest in whatever you want to essentially. Its possible we will see this as a 24/7 market.

Identify and invest in early players That‚Äôs what I want to do. The only one I could identify and invest in is OSTKs TZero (meaning zero days to settlement) but there must be competitors. We are going to see a revolution in markets and I think that any player in this space is a great investment opportunity right now. I can‚Äôt make promises because I an amateur and I‚Äôm not advocating that you invest in any one platform. I‚Äôm just a smoothie brain who thinks he has figured out the next big thing.

Cue WSB. I had known about this reddit group for some time but didnt really pay much attention, until GME happened. I opened a trading acc and put in 650‚Ç¨ - a measly 1.25 shares... yes yes, i was late as fuck, but hear me out. I lost 85% within no time at all, but while looking at my portfolio every 15 seconds I invested into a bunch of other things like criptic currency and a few other stocks, including OCGN. Well, i got back my losses on GME and then some. And with my business education background i have a basic understanding of how the markets work.

Why your GME losses have nothing to do with Robinhood,0,lfla1i,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfla1i/why_your_gme_losses_have_nothing_to_do_with/,51,1612845681.0,"Before you downvote me to hell, no I don't use Robinhood because they don't support cost basis tax optimizations and other features like IRA accounts. I'm just tired of the daily posts crying about wsb tendies being stolen by Robinhood.

**You really want to know who stole your tendies?** Look at every single gain post on the front page. How the fuck do you think those users realized their gains? By SELLING their thousands of shares and call options and driving the price down. This is the nature of a short squeeze - it's just a pyramid scheme and the truth is that the all of the people buying in at the top are getting fucked. 


Now I know you retards can't do your own research so here's a FAQ to answer all your conspiracy theory questions:



**Why did Robinhood only restrict buy orders?**

Firstly, this is false. Robinhood paused *opening positions*. So if you were short GME (or short put options), you could close your position by buying back GME or buying back your put option. So why is closing positions OK but opening positions is not? Because closing a position is a reduction in risk (since you have realized your gain/loss) while opening positions is an increase in risk - something that the clearinghouse factors in when it calculates the broker's collateral requirement.

Secondly, if Robinhood had restricted closing positions as well, I'm 100% sure you retards would be complaining about not being able to sell on GME's second highest peak day.

**If I bought GME shares using cash, why did Robinhood have trouble posting collateral to the DTCC?**

First off, it's illegal for brokers to use cash from customers to post collateral. Secondly, the DTCC unilaterally raised the collateral requirement for both shares and options above its normal requirement (the exact percentage is confidential but will be revealed in the congressional hearing). And finally, trading volume *more than doubled* in a single day from January 26th - January 27th (most of this increase is due to trading on Robinhood). So Robinhood not having enough cash to cover a more than 3X increase in collateral is perfectly reasonable. If you have a 3k mortgage payment every month and one month your bank says you now owe 9k, how many of you would be able to pay up? Robinhood's decision was basically between restricting a stock that less than 10% of users on Robinhood own or shutting down for the rest of the week, if not longer, because it longer has its primary clearing house to settle any trades.

**Robinhood earns money from Citadel and Citadel bailed out Melvin Capital and even my smooth brain can connect the dots**

You're legitimately retarded if you actually think Citadel called up Robinhood to perpetuate market manipulation. Ah yes, Citadel pays quants 400k+ a year to come up with alpha generating strategies but the only way they can make money is to call up a broker and commit market manipulation in the most easily traceable way ever??? 

I actually don't understand the logic here. Your theory is that Citadel needed Robinhood to bail them out of their short positions. And yet the day after Robinhood lifted restrictions, short interest *increased* back to pre-restriction levels. **Why the fuck would hedge funds commit market manipulation to get out of their short positions, only to double down on more short positions the day after??**

**Robinhood restricting opening long positions caused GME to tank I'm fucking poor now fuck Robinhood etc.**

If you graph Robinhood's restrictions against the price of GME, you actually get an inverse correlation (r^2 = -0.73). That is, when Robinhood first introduced restrictions, GME had its second best trading day. Then every day following, as Robinhood reduced restrictions, GME price fell lower and lower. What does this mean? Robinhood adding restrictions is not the reason why GME is tanking.  

So why is it tanking? Short squeezes are basically a pyramid scheme. The people at the top are the people that got in early. Then as the hype builds, more people join the bottom of the pyramid. That influx of new retards is the ONLY thing that is supporting the upwards price movement because the company has zero fundamentals. Finally there comes a point when enough people at the top cash out their massive positions and at the same time new people aren't joining the hype quickly enough (realistically, who the fuck is buying 420 shares when the price is $300+). And everything comes crumbling down. 

Sorry to shatter your rosy perception of wsb, but you have to realize that every post telling you to üíéüôå when the stock was 300+ was a massive fucking bait. Cramer pointed this out and advised everyone to cash out while we were ahead but you guys roasted him to fuck for it. It's only sad that you guys now choose to pin this on Robinhood, the company that made the entire squeeze and this very sub possible in the first place.

**tldr** you guys are fucking retards that bought into a pyramid scheme and now blame Robinhood for being unable to keep up with your chain inting.",2021-02-09 04:41:21

Genuine Question- Do You Feel You Can Make Money Investing?,142,lfk73n,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfk73n/genuine_question_do_you_feel_you_can_make_money/,173,1612842870.0,"I don‚Äôt want to sound like r/investing, but I was surprised at how many new comers seem to believe the stock market is literally rigged against them... that just isn‚Äôt the case.

I know we hate the founder, but his original vision is very much alive and well today. He was a guy who was more interested in finance and public markets than most and wanted to have a forum where he could discuss single stock trades. He tried this on other outlets but was always told ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too risky‚Äù ‚Äúmost stock pickers underperform‚Äù ‚Äúyou are better off buying index funds‚Äù. The thing is, all of that is very much true, the only difference with us is that we know this and we understand the risks we take buying single stocks & options.

If you came here because you thought GameStop was the only way to make money in the market, then you need to take a step back and do some research. We take big risks here, but again, we know they‚Äôre risky and we know what we should be doing‚Äî in fact most of us largely save via index funds and trade as a hobby.

I genuinely encourage all new members to come back after you‚Äôve watched some videos on portfolio theory, the efficient frontier, asset allocation, and the efficient market hypothesis. Almost anyone can make money buying index funds. It might not be huge money, but it‚Äôs how most people are able to retire these days. 

Most people who get rich on single stocks were already rich or they got those stocks by being employees of the company via compensation. Most options expire worthless (theta gang). You should know your risks before you come in with your nihilistic outlook and try to protest hedge funds by taking the losing end of their trades.",2021-02-09 03:54:30

So I was thinking, if a short squeeze was still to happen, the hedge funds would wait it out (pay interest on the borrowed stock) and buy all the shares they shorted back at the lowest possible price, logic would suggest that they would have not bought the shorted stock at the peak of 500$ but instead would let the waters calm down ( cause some chaos by driving the price down to trigger some sell off ) and then buy back the shares owed close to the price they sold it for to minimize losses ($5/share I believe).  

Now if the shorts are yet to be covered, would the stock sky rocket when the price reaches around the $5 - $6 range and all the shares shorted would all be bought at the same time?  Also do we have reliable information of when the short expires?

The Bull Case for CLNE: A Stepping Stone to the Future,113,lfj2k0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfj2k0/the_bull_case_for_clne_a_stepping_stone_to_the/,60,1612839918.0,"This is my first DD post so please forgive me. I meant to post this on the weekend but shit happens lol.

**What is CLNE?**

Since this is pretty googleable information, I'll keept it short. CLNE provides natural gas solutions for transportation throughout the US and Canada. They started out with compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquified natural gas (LNG), which are both good, but more importantly now have renewable natural gas (RNG). They sell RNG under the name Redeem and you can read all about it [here](https://redeem.cleanenergyfuels.com/) The important thing here is that RNG is carbon negative.

CLNE also has a large infrastructure for natural gas refueling. They currently have a shitload of stations around the US and Canada, which is great because the candiates for using natural gas most are things like 18 wheelers and other stuff that just make big long trips. It's too bad for them that they were so early, because no one was using natural gas till more recent times (unless you look at other countries, but...).

CLNE is also on a recent uptrend after [getting an upgrade from Credit Suisse to $17.](https://www.benzinga.com/news/21/02/19463411/credit-suisse-initiates-coverage-on-clean-energy-fuels-with-outperform-rating-announces-price-target)

**Why Natural Gas?**

As I mentioned before, RNG is carbon negative. More and more commercial vehicles are being converted to natural gas use in order to reduce carbon footprint (70% decrease according to CLNE's own website). More companies are going to be converting their vehicles to use natural gas (in fact, Amazon is already making the move [here](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-engines-natural-gas-exclusive/exclusive-amazon-orders-hundreds-of-trucks-that-run-on-natural-gas-idUSKBN2A52ML)). This is an easy stepping stone right now, since doing electric fleets is a non-trivial matter (but will eventually happen). In fact, RNG has a lower carbon rating than electric batteries, [according to Commiefornia's Air Resource Board](http://biomassmagazine.com/articles/17518/rng-helps-reach-carbon-negative-milestone-in-california). With demand for natural gas ramping up in the transportation sector, who else but CLNE who provides both RNG and the facilities to refuel with more, which are already established.

**Increasing Natural Gas Demand**

Companies are not changing their fleets to start using natural gas out of the goodness of their hearts. With Buyden now in office, we can expect more sweeping green policies. Most of these policies in the past have focused on a carbon tax, which means carbon intensive fuels will get more expensive. I'd imagine you also get a tax credit for going carbon-negative (hey there's that word again), [which RNG will assist with](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-lauds-passage-of-alternative-fuel-tax-credit-by-congress).

We also see an increase in demand for RNG happening right now. [CLNE last December reported signing deals for 58 million gallons of RNG](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-signs-deals-for-over-58-million-gallons-of-redeem-tm-renewable-natural-gas-to-meet-growing-demand-for-carbon-neutral-fuel-01608030439?tesla=y), which is quite good because in the entirety of 2019 [they only sold 143 million gallons](https://www.cleanenergyfuels.com/press-room/clean-energy-delivers-143-million-gallons-of-redeem-renewable-natural-gas-in-2019-a-30-jump-from-last-year-strong-finish-in-transit-and-solid-waste)

[Lastly, we have new trucks coming in that run on natural gas from Volvo and more](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2020/11/08/natural-gas-vehicles-are-making-inroads-and-want-joe-biden-to-get-aboard/?sh=34de9bfb2d5e). I believe we will continue to see more companies move to natural gas fleets which will continuously pump this stock.

**Partnerships**

CLNE has entered partnerships with BP and has an upcoming one with Total. With BP, [they are joint owning and operating RNG facilities](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-to-make-more-carbon-negative-fuel-available-for-transportation-with-bp-01608567431?tesla=y). With BP that will share half the control, and BP fronted $50 million to fund the costs of the join venture. 

With Total [they have a memorandum of understanding](https://www.wsj.com/articles/clean-energy-and-total-to-develop-additional-carbon-negative-fuel-and-infrastructure-01608548752?tesla=y) to develop more RNG infrastructure. They will similarly be having a 50/50 joint venture, with more support coming from Total. I believe Total is providing $50 million as well for this venture, with an additional credit support of $60 million. 

These deals were fairly recent, so CLNE is on the upswing here with big oil coming in and backing them up for natural gas.

**Expansion**

Well, CLNE was already early to natural gas infrastructure, much to their detriment to be honest. Luckily it's paying off now. I would think they would continue to expand with more refueling stations, and more ways to produce RNG (the joint ventures seem to be pointing in this direction so that's good).

I know there have been some rumblings for an expansion into Hydrogen, which honestly would be huge if their refueling stations can support that. However after talking to some people more familiar with hydrogen fuel, this might be unlikely. Apparently swapping natural gas infrastructure to also support hydrogen is not easy, on account of the fact that hydrogen is pretty liable to explode, plus some other issues (like leaching issues??). I would actually hope they DON'T expand into this area because I believe what they have is currently very strong, and hydrogen stations themselves are negative ROI. 

**The Numbers**

Honestly these don't look bad and if you want me to map this out more I'll do it if there's interest. I'm too lazy to do detailed analysis on this right now though.

**The Play**

As more news comes out this stock will pump further and further. If you want to get a small position you can do that now, and then just load up on any dips. I do expect retracement from today's price a bit. Conservative price target is $22 by Summer, and the bull target is $60 end of year. 

[I am holding 50 contracts of 3/19 $13c, and 50 contracts of 6/18 $17c which I purchased last week (These are printing hard). I also hold 7500 shares at a cost basis of around ~$6.](https://i.ibb.co/CJM6fDY/image.png) I will personally probably roll half my 3/19 $13c's into  4/16 $17c or something like that. I still think CLNE is a strong play and will be adding to my positions.",2021-02-09 03:05:18
SGMO tldr üéÅ,107,lfijfg,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfijfg/sgmo_tldr/,33,1612838525.0,"SGMO TLDR

THIS IS NOT STOCK ADVICE, JUST EDUCATIONAL/ENTERTAINMENT (maybe lol) AND MY OWN THOUGHTS ABOUT WHY I LIKE THIS STOCK.  

SGMO TLDR 

1. Low risk verus very high potential reward (The chance of any major setback obliterating stock price is super low for multiple reasons better explained below and many opportunities and paths for giant gains.

2. Growing patent cataloge in a new rapidily growing feild of genetic treatments and cures. (This adds both locked in value irrelevant of any company success and akes them a more desirable aquisition target from a giant pharma brand)

3. You like CRSP this is CRISPR 2.0. At most few research cycles behind crspr success seems inevitable and despite being years behind crspr it could catch up soon based on technology and computing leaps and the experience gained from successful CSPR treatments and trials.

4. CRSP comparison even if you disagree places focus on this company from people With crspr FoMO.

5. ANY significant advance on any of the multiple severe conditions/diseases they are working on that alone could cause a doubling or more of the low stock price

6. Very juicy looking target for acquisition by a larger pharmaceutical company looking to get into gene editing with a relatively/currently cheap acquisition (the reasons it‚Äôs a good stock are exact reason why it‚Äôs a good acquisition for a giant pharma brand)

How to read DD on WSB.,785,lfi3va,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfi3va/how_to_read_dd_on_wsb/,70,1612837388.0,"So you've found a post, and it looks damn good - nicely formatted, seems to have a lot of fancy words, and you don't know how to even begin evaluating their theories.  So, what do you do?

Analyze their analysis!

First, is the user reputable/legitimate, or is it a bot post?  Check their user history - if they've been around for a while, and post to other forums, and have no massive gaps in their online-time, they're probably real.

Second, if it's a real user, are they trying to shill something for market manipulation or pump&dumping?   If so, they'll usually be banned/deleted very quickly, but if you're browsing /new DDs you'll need to be vigilant.  Avoid penny stocks or anything where the goal is specifically purchase->effect-oriented.  If the OP has proof of positions, and it doesn't look like a pump&dump, then at least they're buying into their own theory - and I trust theories people are willing to bet on as they posit them more than theories that are just like, ""I don't wanna but good luck all"".

Third, the actual content of the post!  Do you understand what they're pitching?  If not, do the comments explain anything that might be confusing?   Make sure you actually understand the theory you're buying into.    If you understand it, the next question is, ""how reasonable does this seem""?  If it's something that's blindingly obvious even to a layman, it's possible that the market's already priced it in and no movements will be made based on the information.  If it's totally far-fetched, like banking on a specific individual dying or lottery-level odds, probably worth skipping.    The sweet spot, the ideal, the diamond in the rough, is finding DD that invokes new thoughts that no one has had, but are totally reasonable and likely.    Read comments, see what the consensus is, and pay special attention to dissent - dissent is way more useful than agreement for furthering a theory.  Read their sources, or do independent research - see if other factors support their theory, see how well-known or popular the theory is already, and evaluate based on that.

Now if you decide that you like the DD, and may act on it, you have to choose *how* you act on it.   And this is the very, very hard part - opportunity cost and cost-benefit analysis.  Is buying into this new theory superior to any existing theories you're currently acting on?  Does it match your risk profile?  Is it a stock DD, or an options recommendation?  How much are you willing to gamble?  What is your exit strategy?  Can't help much here, that goes into actual financial advice, and I am not a financial advisor, just a ""how to judge random idiots on the internet"" expert.

Let's say you don't like the DD - you're not gonna buy in.  But what if you think that the person's crazy?  What if you think their theories are not just baseless, but are actually wrong?  You may choose to bet **against** the DD!  And yes, you can do this with anything you read - you can decide that they're stupid, fuck em, and bet against them.  Their loss porn becomes your gains, and vice-versa.  Investing in inversing bad DD is a valid option - they're buying up options, you can sell some options, or buy puts below their calls, or so on.

Retail trading is mostly treated as noise by hedge funds - but just because it's not your day job to trade doesn't mean you can't do research that hedge funds may miss.  As retail investors, it's extremely difficult to have a superior trading strategy or more general market knowledge than the professionals, but we can figure out niche opportunities that the higher-level analyzers miss.  If you intimately know an industry, or have a theory that you think financial institutions would miss, or think you're just smarter or more well-informed than them, absolutely develop a DD post (aka a market theory) and share or act on it.

tl;dr:  If you're the kind of nerd that scrolls to tl;drs and makes decisions based on that, then all the other shit I said is irrelevant, :rocket: :diamond: :ape: ",2021-02-09 02:23:08

Woke up quick at about noon  
Just thought that I had to be in Compton soon  
I gotta get drunk before the day begins  
Before my mother starts bitchin' about my friends  
About to go and damn near went blind  
Young niggaz at the pad throwin' up gang signs  
Ran in the house and grabbed my clip  
With the Mac-10 on the side of my hip  
Bailed outside and pointed my weapon  
Just as I thought, the fools kept steppin'  
Jumped in the fo' hit the juice on my ride  
I got front back and side to side  
Then I let the Alpine play  
Bumpin' new shit by NWA  
It was ""Gangsta Gangsta"" at the top of the list  
Then I played my own shit, it went somethin' like this

Cruisin' down the street in my six-fo'  
Jockin' the bitches, slappin' the hoes  
Went to the park to get the scoop  
Knuckleheads out there cold shootin' some hoops  
A car pulls up, who can it be?  
A fresh El Camino rolled, Kilo G  
He rolls down his window and he started to say  
It's all about makin' that GTA

Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Down on B's in the place to give me the pace  
He said my man JB is on freebase  
The boy JB was a friend of mine  
Til I caught him in my car tryin' to steal my Alpine  
Chased him up the street to call a truce  
The silly motherfucker pull out a deuce-deuce  
Little did he know I had a loaded 12 gauge  
One sucker dead, LA Times front page

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

Bored as hell and I wanna get ill  
So I went to a spot where my homeboys chill  
The fellows out there, makin' that dollar  
I pulled up in my 6-4 Impala  
They greet me with a 40 and I start drinkin'  
And from the 8-ball my breath starts stinkin'  
Left to get my girl, to rock that body  
Before I left I hit the Bacardi  
Went to her house to get her out of the pad  
Dumb hoe says something stupid that made me mad  
She said somethin' that I couldn't believe  
So I grabbed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave  
She started talkin' shit, wouldn't you know?  
Reached back like a pimp and slapped the hoe  
Her father jumped up and he started to shout  
So I threw a right-cross and knocked his old ass out

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I'm rollin' hard now I'm under control  
Then wrapped the six-fo' round the telephone poll  
I looked at my car and I said, ""Oh brother  
I throw it in the gutter and go buy another""  
Walkin home and I see the G ride  
Now Kat is drivin Kilo on the side  
As they busted a U, they got pulled over  
An undercover cop in a dark green Nova  
Kat got beat for resistin arrest  
He socked the pig in the head for rippin his Guess  
Now G is cut for doin the crime  
For defense on the boy, he'll do some time

'Cause the boyz n tha hood are always hard  
You come talkin' that trash we'll pull your card  
Knowin' nothin' in life but to be legit  
Don't quote me boy, 'cause I ain't sayin' shit

I went to get them out but there was no bail  
The fellaz start to riot in the county jail  
Two days later in municipal court  
Kilo G on trial straight cold cut a fork  
""Disruption of the court"", said the judge  
On a six year sentence my man didn't budge  
Bailiff came over to turn him in  
Kilo G looked up and gave a grin  
He yelled out ""fire!"", then came Suzi  
The bitch came in with a sub-machine uzi  
Police shot the bitch but didn't hurt her  
Both up state for attempted murder

The important thing people need to remember is everyone on here is a stranger. We joke and talk shit which is fine and all, but you have no idea what people are doing outside of what they commented. The majority of people here are likely in it for themselves. You don't know what their motivation is, be it telling people to buy/hold for those looking to cash in, those who ""just like the stock"", or those that say sell because they are ""shills"" or have some other ulterior motive. Maybe they are trying to look out for you. Maybe not.

At the end of the day stop letting emotions and the temperature of this and other subreddits dictate your choices. What happens here might influence the market, but I've seen too many posts about diamond hands and monkey grips with the stock continuing to decline to think we have any significant role in what happens with the price.

DD - Patience is a Virtu,76,lfhlp7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfhlp7/dd_patience_is_a_virtu/,20,1612836069.0,"Well done. Somehow, against all odds, a large number of you autistic fucks have made some life changing gains on GME. This post is in no way encouraging you to sell your positions or even open new ones. Thats because I'm not a fiduciary advisor and know fuck all about what you should or shouldn't do. All I will say is welcome to all the new members out there and if there's one piece of advice I can give you, its to trust your gut.



Now lets get into it. This post is my DD that I wanted to share on $VIRT, not because I am recommending you to do anything, but because I enjoy researching shit because its fun and I figured this would help organize my thoughts. 



So lets get into it. I'm sure most of you have noticed the new exposure this sub has been getting on a worldwide scale. If you've been here even since Dec. in 2020, you'd notice this sub has even gained over 6M subscribers in the last month. I'm not going to tell you I've been around since the start, I've just been lurking and a post or comment every once and a while since I started following a few years ago. The sub count really means fuck all to be honest, the real numbers that are important here are the #'s of new retail traders joining the markets while bringing in new money by doing so. Give this Reuters article a quick read (promise it will only take 5 minutes, 10 if you're a true retard): https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-numbers-idUSKBN29Y2PW




For those who are lazy fucks who don't want to open the article: with no fee trading, retail traders have flooded the market. To what extent you may ask, and why the fuck does this matter? Well back in Jan 2020, before the March crash, retail made up ~17% of trades on the market. By July/August, this shot up to 25%. Some analyst in this article noted their prediction for 2021 is 30%+ of volume will be made up of retail. **THE TREND IS INCREASING** for those of you who couldn't pass your 2nd grade math class. So why did i even mention GME to start? Well according to an analyst from Piper Sandler, this past Wednesday set a new record for volume traded for US cash equities of **24.5 Billion** . Thats volume traded, not a $ amount. Options volume also hit a record high in volume at 57.1 Million. For both stocks and options, this supposedly is double the record in volume traded in a single day from 2020, or triple in 2019. One last important #, its estimated amongst the top 6 brokers, there are 100 Million+ retail traders. **100 Million** thats a fuck ton of regular Joes' and retards joining the game gambling away their $600 stimulus checks. 



TLDR: Retail trading #s are going the fuck up, and fast. This in turn mean a fuck ton more volume traded on the market.



OK Cool. Why does this matter? Well aside from Melvin Securities (Melvin Capitals Market Maker/scum of the earth), there are other Market Makers that do the same thing (provide liquidity to brokers allowing autists like us to buy and sell stocks and options). Companies like $VIRT, Virtu Financial, that are publicly traded. Lets take a look at the breakdown of trading volume across market makers, Brokers, Liquidity providers etc:


https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BjrX0/1/



$VIRT has showed a consistent increase in trading revenue and EPS since their IPO in 2015. This growth is due to various synergies on their platform from previous buyouts, volume spikes (due to volatility) and you guessed it, an increased amount of retail trading. According to their 2019 full year report, they supported approximately ~30% of all retail trading. This is up from 25% the previous year. 
https://s21.q4cdn.com/422114427/files/doc_financials/2019/ar/Virtu_2019_AnnualReport_Final.pdf



Ok so why does all this matter, if this trend in increased retail trading continues, that means more trading income for $VIRT. And turn, higher earnings. Why? This is because those Ask/Bid spreads you see when buying/selling are typically provided through market makers. They make money off of these spreads. 1 cent here or there, maybe a little more for wider spreads times **millions** of trades/day equals out to big money for them. An even bigger wet dream would be if Melvin Securities went under and that portion of the market making sector being open for the taking. Then again, that probably won't happen but regardless **Fuck Melvin**.



So what else? $VIRT has provided a $0.24 dividend for **22 consecutive quarters** and also announced $100 million in buy backs on their Q3 report released in Nov 2020, also making a statement to ""meaningfully enhance shareholder returns"" with additional buybacks and dividends moving forward. And a shout out to the true gambling addicts who love earnings plays, $VIRT has earnings coming up on **Feb 11th**. Thats this Thursday. Lets even take a look at their revenue growth. According to their 2019 full year report, Virtu took in $1.5B in revenues. Fast forward to the first 3 quarters of 2020, that totals over $2.5B and we still even haven't seen Q4 results yet. While yes, the volume in March/April played a part in this, Q3 revenues were still over $650M, which is still over a third of the full 2019 year. Their current market cap is only ~**$5.4B** with a PE of **6.6**. Talk about nice returns. Time to bet on the Casino instead sitting down at the fucking roulette table. 



TLDR: More retail trading = more $$ for market makers like $VIRT

Currently in the United States a country wide ammo shortage is underway. As a guy who shoots all the time, this is a pain in the ass. I used to pay 15 cents a round for 9mm and 25 cents a round for 556 ammo. Now, both are trending from 78 cents and up per round. 

So, I did some research to see why or what components were in short supply. Primers! The part of the ammo that the firing pin hits and makes the gun subsequentlyfire. There are only four big primer suppliers in the United States. Winchester, CCI, Federal, and Remington. 

VSTO just acquired Remington and owns CCI and Federal. That said, I looked at the 5 year chart. VSTO used to be valued at roughly $50 a share in '16, this was the last great ammo shortage (everyone thought Hillary was going to take there guns). Estimates are 8 million new gun owners, and all of them need ammo. Expert consensus is this shortage could last through 2022. The CEO of VSTO has said they are producing more ammo than they've ever produced before. 

The current ammo shortage is larger, longer, and more sustained (like your wife's boyfriend), then in 2016. As of now, the stock price has yet to reflect this. 

I'm not a financial adviser, I know next to nothing, outside stonks only go up and I can't find any freedom pills for my AR.. Hence, me telling you to put your $$ in VSTO for more tendies. 

TLDR: Ammo sales are exploding (literally), buy the main beneficiary VSTO.",2021-02-09 01:41:18

UPDATE: CLOSED MY POSITION

So a while back I YOLOed my entire account on calls and [lost it all in 4 minutes](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rftx/loss_porn_for_all_the_new_people_here_yoloed_my/). Like a sensible ""investor"" I wanted my money back, I mean who wouldn't right? So fast forward 1 week and I'm thinking ""what's the fastest way I can make my money back?"". Selling puts of course. 

So I'm looking at these 70,000-80,000 contracts and I forgot I couldn't write naked options. So I went ahead and tried to short 100 shares in order to short 1 contract and receive the premium, but there weren't any shares available to short. I started to panic because I had just lost around %80 of my account and I can't find a way to make it back. Luckily, I managed to find something called back/ratio on thinkorswim, and saw that I would receive roughly the same amount of money. Now, you might be asking which stock and strike price I chose. Unfortunately, out of the money put options didn't give me enough money, so I went ahead and did the next best thing: 780/800 str FDs. Now, these are deep in the money puts, so I am relying on them not being exercised. You might think this is stupid but I think it's smart. Who in their right mind would want to exercise an 80k option and lose all of its value just to short 100 shares at 800. The only way it's getting exercised is if the buyer forgets to sell and their broker did it automatically.  I only have around 8,500, so if I somehow have to deliver 200 shares at 800 each.... then I'm fucked. If everything works out I will increase my account value by around 10x, if not then I might $ROPE. It can't go tits up.

For starters, we all know Hollywood fucking sucks right now. So many shitty reboots or sequels, lack of genuinely good films to bring people out. Even if you consider the movies that have some buzz like Dune or Marvel shit, the number of movies that's going to attract a wide audience is low.

Now, consider fhe fact that theaters have been rapidly declining in value for years, and yeah, covid didnt help that either. But even pre-covid amc was already around 7 a share, and with restrictions still currently in place, it seems obvious amc will continue to decline before it improves (meaning selling now and buying again later is the right move if you just really want to hold amc.

The fact of the matter is, the combination of too few good films, over priced concessions, increasing movie ticket prices, and the fact that the majority of people just aren't very interested in theaters anymore and the writing is on the wall for this stock.

It's honestly insane how many people keep repeating this idea that amc is going to explode or even rise significant once covid is over because people are desperate for the ""old days"". They mainly want to go to restaurants, clubs, and bars again. Even in the ""old days"" of pre covid, theaters were not extremely popular. That's not going to magically change. At best, a bump in traffic when restrictions are lifted then back to losing stock value.

February Pharma bets for gambling degenerates,249,lffnz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lffnz6/february_pharma_bets_for_gambling_degenerates/,162,1612831024.0,"For WSB noobs: pharma stocks usually jump or dive after binary (success/failure) events such as drug trial results coming out or FDA approvals.

The size of the move depends mainly on two things:

\- The market cap of the company: for a huge company like JNJ, any event will generate only a tiny move, whereas the value of a penny stock can +10x after a successful event.

\- Size of the addressable market: does the drug treat a rare disease or a common one? The larger the size of the market, the larger the move would be.

Drug approvals are a long process that can take years, but in some instances, the FDA grants priority date to certain drugs. These are referred to as PDUFA events.

Here's a list of the ones (with market cap > 1 billion to avoid my post being removed) coming up this month:

I have added what the drug does (from a quick google search) + addressable market size (basically just my intuition, without any data to support):

* 11 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Evinacumab (high cholesterol), addressable market: small
* 15 Feb 21 [$GTHX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/GTHX) Trilaciclib (designed to improve outcomes of patients who receive chemotherapy), addressable market: large
* 25 Feb 21 [$SRPT](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/SRPT) Casimersen (Duchenne muscular dystrophy), addressable market: small
* 28 Feb 21 [$REGN](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/REGN) Libtayo (metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma), addressable market: small

* 28 Feb 21 [$ATNX](https://stocktwits.com/symbol/ATNX) Oral Paclitaxel (metastatic breast cancer), addressable market: medium

My positions:

I have invested some money only in SRPT and ATNX. In SRPT, because it had a huge drop recently and I hope an approval will trigger a recovery. ATNX because I think the treatment being in the form of a pill is a winner. I haven't researched the rest.

A Gambler's Guide to GME. How to use Expected Value to Help Make Decisions.,436,lff0y0,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lff0y0/a_gamblers_guide_to_gme_how_to_use_expected_value/,93,1612829287.0,"I am not a financial advisor. This is not financial advice. If you are gambling with money that you need to survive, you are acting irresponsibly. I am doing this ONLY with the speculative part of my position (which is all of it, but still true) and this post is referring to that speculative portion.

The expected value (EV) is the anticipated value for an investment or speculation at some point in the future. You calculate all the positive outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence with the negative outcomes multiplied by their likelihood of occurrence and you will have your perceived expected value. If the number is negative, you are better off getting out and cutting losses. Gamblers win by making positive EV decisions, even if sometimes you have the nuts on the turn and then a fish flops a flush on the river.

Expected Value (EV) = ((Total Negative Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence)+(Total Positive Outcomes)\*(Likelihood of Occurrence))

* If EV>0 HOLD! DO NOT FOLD! I might consider buying more with funds that I can stand to lose.
* If EV=0 Grey Area. You aren't really making a big mistake no matter what you do.
* If EV<0 Accept that you lost, time to cut losses and fold. If you are honestly here by your appraisal of the situation, sell. Yes, I said it.

With this speculative portion, the amount that you have already put in is a sunk cost, if you paid $420 a share or $5 a share, that amount is gone. We will only look at the price that it is today. For simplicity, let's say it's $60 right now.

So let's say I think that the lowest this stock can go is $30, due to favorable coverage and impressions among zoomers and millenials, who are the primary demographic, along with news of the new internet-savvy hires, the Chewy guy and all that.

So negative outcome of $60 to $30 represents a 50% drop. What's my target price? Let's say its  $1000, representing a gain from our example's current price of 1,566.67%. Likelihood that it hit's $30 before $1,000, idk, let's say I estimate a 95% chance of that happening first.

EV =(-50% loss from current level)(95% likelihood)+(1,566.67% gain)(5% likelihood)

EV=(-.5)(.95)+(15.6667)(.05)

EV=((-0.475)+(0.7833))=0.3833 (Expected EV is positive from our assumptions, I should HOLD!)

And the fabled $69,420? I'm not gonna write out the math on this, but it turns out that the perceived breakeven EV is with a 99.96% chance to fail versus 0.04% chance to succeed at this level. If I thought that the chance of this succeeding was greater than 0.04%, not 4%, 0.04%, I should at least HOLD my position.

‚ÄúSO YOU'RE TELLING ME THERE'S A CHANCE!‚Äù

‚ÄúYEEAHHH!‚Äù -Lloyd Christmas

**Now someone might tell me that my assumptions are wrong; that the drop is more or less likely than I presented or could be more (or less). That's fair. I might be wrong, but this is what I am looking at and the way I am looking at it. Do your own DD.** (edit: bolded this for all the retards that wanna fixate on the assumptions in my example. I used what I feel is a pessimistic likelihood for effect.)

Anyway, hope this puts things into perspective. The Hedge Funds want you to fold your hand at the lowest point possible, because that is positive EV for them. If you can afford to gamble (er, this is the stock market, so um, let's say speculate), these are things to think a bout.

TLDR: Based on assumptions of worst case scenarios and their estimated likelihood, along side current prices & target goals, you can make math-based decisions on whether you should sell or hold.",2021-02-09 00:08:07

General: 
During a recession energy consumption always decreases relatively, and even more so with Covid, due to lack of office spaces, lack of recreation, and lack of travel / commute. You can look back at the ‚Äò08 ‚Äò09 crisis and view how energy and c02 emissions skyrocketed after Michael Burry got famous. [1]
   
  

Next, we have the catalysts, Joe Biden. According to his administration there are only 9 years left to stop the worst consequences of climate change. Biden will act quickly, and aggressively. He‚Äôs working with Congress to enact in 2021 legislation and plans that will put America on an irreversible path to economy wide net zero emissions. While also rallying the rest of the world to pursue clean action through leadership and action. Not really lastly, but also make $400bn as ONE part of a broad mobilization of public investment in clean energy and innovation (relatively old news, but relevant) All while creating 10,000,000 new jobs in clean energy. This is within his ‚ÄúBiden will make a $2 trillion accelerated investment‚Äù which also pertains to the auto industry such as EV gov vehicles, see WKHS as an example.[2][3]  
    

Energy has already gone up alot this last 6 months. It's too late! False. So has everything, even giants like Apple are up over 100% since March lows.   Clean energy has been supressed these last 4 years, and are only going back to where they belong.
  

Hydrogen: 
Recently Mercedes-Benz spins off it‚Äôs truck unit due to ever changing landscape in industrial and commercial vehicles. While premium sedans have largely been adopting the EV mantra, commercial trucking has seemed to go the way of hydrogen. ‚Äú..while the truck business is investing in hydrogen fuel cell technology. [6] Recently Ballad power Systems $BLDP signed a deal to make the hydrogen fuel cell for hydrogen power boats as well. [7]

  

Nuclear::
Now, we have Solar, Wind, Hydrogen and what else? Well, reasonably speaking you also have Uranium to Nuclear energy. Did you know that The world has largely put most of their uranium mines on hold and in maintenance mode? Right now there are 442 Nuclear Reactors operating within 30 countries, primarily in US, France, China, Russia and Japan (rip) this consume 200 MILLION pounds in Uranium per year. We are currently sitting at a 20 million pound deficit and could reach as high as 50 million pounds.     
  

Utilities have been underbuying Uranium since 2014 than they need to produce nuclear energy, the difference (or deficit) between what they are buying and what they need to produce Nuclear energy has been filled by drawdown of existing inventories. We also have Elon Musk talking about Nuclear Bull case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKH-uVqg9OI [4][5]
  



# If I had to choose a single ticker from each, I would choose **$FCEL** for Hydrogen, **$NXE** for Nuclear, **$ENPH** for solar

The tides in energy have changed, we are seeing huge pushes globally to adopt these new technologies. If you rub your couple of brain cells together really hard, this shit is the future.    

Tickers: $FCEL, $BLDP, $PLUG, $NXE, $ENPH or if you want ETFs, $TAN, $FAN, $PBW (shout out to $ICLN gang) 
  
Final: This was way longer and harder than I anticipated to put together. We still have Energy Storage, Wind, and I didn‚Äôt even address Solar reasons, Biofuels or NatGas. But these are my big bets for 2021. I'm aware EV is beast, but so is everyone else, bringing new information to light that may be less represented. 
I'll do a part2: if you enjoy this expanding and adding extra details.

  Within the global economy, there are several emerging markets. Asia, Africa, and Latin America have experienced and are on the cusp of unprecedented growth. Pretty much every industry is booming, but not every industry is easy to invest in. 
  
  The three fastest growing industries within these countries (mainly Brazil, North/ South Africa, SE Asia) are consumer products, infrastructure and development, and financial infrastructure. Consumer goods and development are extremely segmented industries; it would be almost impossible to dependably buy stocks that cover a large market share. However, due to corruption and ease of communication with foreign entities, the banking industries within these countries are fairly centralized. 
  
  The banks I have mainly been looking at are BDORY (Brazil), SGBLY (South Africa), IBN (India), among others. Most of these banks haven‚Äôt fully recovered from the initial coronavirus drop so if you‚Äôre like me, and think pretty much every US stock is overpriced, this could be the play for you.

This post is to offer a different perspective. Hopefully offering contrarian opinions is something that's still allowed on this sub.

1. You really don't feel that going from about $38 to more than $400 in a week is a short squeeze?
2. If you are one of those people that compares to VW, then...wouldn't Cohen joining the board be the catalyst? And, go look at the charts for yourself but instead of looking at screenshots here, ZOOM OUT on both charts. Looks like a short squeeze to me.
3. There was no evidence before GME of Robinhood having a desire to screw over retail investors. The CEO is a millenial...that's not their thing.
4. What there IS evidence of, is incompetence. Doesn't it seem more likely that the brokerage with a crayon interface that once allowed UNLIMITED FUCKING MARGIN simply didn't have the liquidity to handle something like this? And that the CEO is a fucking dumbass who didn't want to admit it on national tv?
5. Why would Citadel even need to pressure Robinhood to begin with? They could have easily seen this coming and prepared for it.
6. If you still believe Citadel was behind this, then RH isn't even the 'enemy' in this scenario anyway. It'd be the DTCC that ultimately made the decision to raise margins to 100%.
7. If you feel that Melvin was lying about covering their position when they actually didn't, then the silver lining is that this is blatant, obvious, and easily disproven. They ARE being investigated; So this would come out and it'd be a big fucking deal. Which makes me doubt they'd lie about something they have no ability to cover up.
8. You really should go look at other subs once in a while: Stocks, Stockmarket, Pennystocks, and Options. Contrarian opinions are allowed there. If nothing else, isn't more information before you make a financial decision a good thing?

Disclosure: I've had multiple positions on GME. Bought calls and puts, bought shares, sold covered calls using both shares and LEAPS as leverage. I made a lot of mistakes during the run, but have come out so far with about 150% profit (could have been over 1000% if I played it a lot better)",2021-02-08 23:30:52
Is there a difference between the GME squeeze and AMC squeeze. And is it possible to maybe save one?,121,lfe5ql,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfe5ql/is_there_a_difference_between_the_gme_squeeze_and/,192,1612826894.0,So I am a smooth brained ape who got into the squeeze without fully understanding it like most. Now I am not trying to pursued anyone to doing anything but I was wondering if it was possible to to get some traction again by doing something desperate... So I know I will get stoned for this but what if we just focused all our efforts on AMC. What if we all moved out position to AMC I was thinking considering the price difference we could still make some significant volume changes if we all moved positions. To be clear I am in both GME and AMC but personally I believe AMC is the safer bet in the long rung with or without the possible squeeze. So what if all us Ape just focus on getting AMC to the moon. Would it be possible to start beating the hedge funds again?,2021-02-08 23:28:14
Enphase Energy (ENPH) pre-earnings (Feb 9) Extensive DD,264,lfdy2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfdy2w/enphase_energy_enph_preearnings_feb_9_extensive_dd/,149,1612826296.0,"EDIT: Posted a post-earnings DD in which I analyzed the earnings results and web-call. Post is under approval and is not online yet. Let's hope a Mod will approve it ASAP.   
Hi all,

Since the GME hype has calmed down a bit, I present you with my first DD on this forum.

First of all, no financial analyst here. This is no investment advice and do your own research.

I will take you trough each step in my DD. Sorry for the long post, but I want to have a discussion with you on my DD, possible flaws in my research etc. Therefore, I will post everything I do.

**Okay here we go:**

I have a background in economics. Since the market nowadays is quite high, I am trying to analyze every investment I make thoroughly to minimize the risks. After November last year it was quite easy to make a return on investment. However, we have increased a lot and I feel the urge to deep dive in every company I invest in.

**Step 0, find an interesting company to analyze.**

What my ritual is, is to analyze the list of next week‚Äôs earnings. I analyze every company on the list, think about possible market conditions which have changed in favor or disfavor for the company, read news articles, and look at the earnings.

While doing this, me and my team have picked Enphase Energy.

**Step 1, look at the previous realized EPS and Revenue vs. forecasted EPS and Revenue:**

First observations:

\- 2020 amazing year.

\- Dip Q3 2019.

\- Good year 2018

\- Something was going on in 2017. But there was a change since 2018, 2019, 2020 are good years.

\- Bad year 2016, again something changed.

Please note the price implication in the last column. Visualized here:

Observation: High P/E value compared to competitors. Large market cap, higher ROE.

\- Stock price stays above MA-Simple (50) line despite any dips (Positive)

\- Growth in P/E ratio (Negative)

**Step 3, Seasonality analysis.**

\- February has on average been a strong month. So buying now would on average be a good idea. This month it has increased 6% while the average for February is 24.8% (8 year average) (no statistically proven).

**Step 4, Ownership.**

**Important question to ask: were there any strong buys/sells in the last couple months. The more recent the data, the better. We don‚Äôt look at holding reported at 09/30/2020.**

Ubiquiti ‚Äì UI ‚Äì Momentum stock with Potential Short Squeeze or Leveraged Buyout,45,lfduai,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfduai/ubiquiti_ui_momentum_stock_with_potential_short/,20,1612825999.0,"Ubiquiti Inc. develops networking technology for service providers, enterprises, and consumers.

On 2/5/2021 Ubiquiti announced another quarter that exceeded expectations with strong global demand for their products. The growth/adoption of their products into the enterprise demonstrate that the company continues to gain traction against the likes of Cisco (CSCO).

For those that read a headline and act: A couple of items to be aware of.

1. While the stock has a 20.8B market cap, it only trades a little over 100k shares a day or about 1.5% of the available float. This means using limit orders when buying or selling might be best. Otherwise the MM‚Äôs will take advantage of you.
2. The liquidity/spreads in the option market are horrible. Outright buying the stock is likely the way to play this stock

**A Little Background**

Ubiquiti was founded by Robert Pera and went public in 2011. This is the same Robert Pera that owns the Memphis Grizzlies. I like to think of him in the same light as Mark Cuban. He is a disruptor by nature and has an anti-establishment approach. He is not always conventional in his methods when engaging with the media and public which likely results in less overall hype around Ubiquiti.

As of 12/31/2020 there were 62.8m shares outstanding. Founder Robert Pera owns 56.2m shares or 89.6% of the company.

The company has been aggressively buying back shares, reducing the shares outstanding by over 2m in 2020. As of 12/31/20 they still had $385.2m authorized under the ‚Äú2020 May Program‚Äù which facilitates the company‚Äôs repurchase program.

According to [Fintel.io](https://fintel.io/), institutions own 6.9m shares, resulting in over 100% ownership between Pera and institutions. Some percentage of these institutions represent index funds that are not actively managed. The institutional ownership may be overstated as a result of stale data and/or the company‚Äôs repurchase of 309,133 shares in the last 3 months of 2020.

Then there are the retail investors that own some small slice of this company. Some of the retail investors are self-declared Ubiquiti ‚ÄúFan Boys‚Äù such as myself that have owned the stock for years and have deployed their equipment in our homes and across the enterprise‚Äôs where we work.

The end result is a float of 6.5m shares of which some percentage that is owned by index funds or owned by ‚ÄúFan Boys‚Äù and not actively traded.

The company just declared another $0.40 dividend. With $1.60 in anticipated dividends over the next 12 months, Pera will be taking home an estimated $90m per year in dividends. Why is this relevant? Pera is is able to generate cash from his Ubiquiti ownership, without the need of selling shares. He just holds his current shares while increasing his ownership percentage through the company‚Äôs stock repurchase program.

**Now for the Shorts**

As of 1/15/21 there were 1.04m shares short which represents 15.94% of the float. We will have to see how these change when the 1/31 numbers are released this week. The low daily average volume results in a Short ratio of 10.38 as calculated by Yahoo finance as of 1/15.

With a great quarter behind them, a growing business, fewer COVID-19 related supply chain risks and combined with insiders who generally do not sell, where will the shorts get shares to cover their bets if the stock continues to move against them?

Pera has not shown a desire to sell.Mid-Cap index funds are not actively managed.‚ÄúFan Boys‚Äù are not selling anytime soon.The Company continues to repurchase shares.

I believe short covering could result in a monumental short squeeze if the stocks momentum continues an upward trajectory.

**Why not a leveraged Buy-out**

Now I am certainly not an expert on leveraged buy-out‚Äôs, but what would it take for Pera to decide to take the whole thing private. Like Michael Dell taking his namesake company private in 2013 before going public again in 2018.

The company is generating great cash flow, actively reducing the number of shares available and is predominantly owned by a multi-billionaire.

With $385.2m still available to repurchase shares, at a current market price of $330, this could remove another 1.16m shares from the float, making it that much easier to buy-out the company.

Is the stock repurchase program a precursor to something bigger?

**Conclusion**

You could conclude this continues to be a growth story of a company looking to disrupt the status quo. They are profitable, growing, pay a dividend and demonstrated good cash flow all the while repurchasing their stock.

This could be a massive, short squeeze in the making as the short ratio is 10.38 and float continues to be reduced as a result of the share repurchase program.

The endgame could be a leveraged buy-out that sees Ubiquiti taken private resulting in a handsome reward for Pera‚Äôs loyal followers.

**TL;DR** Ubiquiti $UI is a position to add to your portfolio based on it fundamentals, momentum and the possibility of a short squeeze that could be a moon shot based on the small float and ongoing share repurchase program.  üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

I Love Ubiquiti‚Äôs products and this stock.

I have been long since 5/22/2014 and have added to my position as recently as 2/5/21

This Content is for informational purposes only, you should not construe any such information or other material as investment or financial advice.

Edit1: Clarification based on a comment. Leveraged Buyout may be the incorrect term for my thought process. I intended to imply that Pera could just take the company private as he owns a significant percentage of the outstanding shares and is reducing the percentage he does not own through the stock repurchase program.

Edit2: Added TL;DR above.  Rookie mistake.",2021-02-08 23:13:19
The game is rigged but üíé‚úä‚úä‚úä can still win!,1551,lfdmhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfdmhk/the_game_is_rigged_but_can_still_win/,234,1612825398.0,"Disclaimer: I'm not a professional in this field. This is not financial advice. I'm not even owning GME or any stocks for that matter but I'm fascinated by this corrupt casino called stock market.

For every GME stock people buy through the wrong brokers, a GME stock becomes available for borrowing. We can pump GME forever but there is no day of reckoning to fight for and the hedgies know that. They know that interest is already fading and weak hands are selling and they don't even have to buy those stocks. They are happy when it's falling as that's the plan all along. And even if all short squeezers went to more honest brokers that don't lend out your stocks (or at least give you the interest paid on that lending which must be insanely high), this attack could be more effective but hedgies could still leverage up and up and up.

There are probably just two ways for the squeeze to still succeed:

* Pump it to insane levels where hedgies can't cover it anymore for real. If you had asked anybody a month ago if $400 would be insane, he would probably have approved though, so where is this ""insane""? $5k? $50k?
* GME steps up and locks in its value, preventing insolvency indefinitely.

People own twice as many stocks as there are in total, so as soon as hedgies try to deleverage, they have to buy GME. Twice. Just to get out of this bet.

I think the knock-out failed but going for the full twelve rounds can still work but not without GME taking action. With GME taking action, a knock-out could be tried again.

Am I wrong? How long do you think shorters can stay afloat? At which price point? How can I buy GME without my broker turning around, lending out **my share**???",2021-02-08 23:03:18

Hate Hedge Funds & Wall Street - Why Not End Them All?

With so many users on WSB, there are many point of views about Wall Street and the market.  However, it seems to me the majority of the community dislikes Hedge Funds and the big players who have trampled over retail investors to make a living.  

Considering the current economic environment, it's more imperative than ever to be ""invested"" in the stock market. The problem is the financial system and Wall Street ultimately benefits from the growing amount of investors.  Even when retail outperforms hedge funds or manages to achieve trades like $GME, it eventually works in their benefit.  The value of assets increasing allows higher returns, speculation, and the securitization of these assets(& rehypothecation) to use for financial gain.  

The Financial system has changed ever since 71s departure of the Gold Standard(which had problems due to Bretton Woods) and 1977 amendment of the Federal Reserve Act.  Ever since then you can see interest rates have trended in down for 40 years now - this is because the Federal Reserve's mandate of ""maximum employment"" causes Fed to stop recessions with lowering interest rates which to incentivize debt/consumption.  Ever since the beginning of the 80s community banks have been annihilated due to monetary policy, its structure, and Congress.  Wealth inequality just so happens to start it's trend upwards, favoring the 1%(really the.1%), and corporations shift board compensation from salary to stock/option compensation; corporations have also increased share buybacks and dividends as a % of profits too.  Again, this is caused by monetary policy and it rewarding speculation and short term invesments over long term(capex/wages).  This structure/policy is also why private equity went on a boom in the 90s and continued ever since.  If you examine corporate bankruptcies from private equity their % is more than double the average.  Pestakeholder.org has a report titled Pirate equity or something along those lines and they tracked retail employment for from 2007-17 or a time frame close, and in 10 years the retail sector had added over 1 million jobs while retail owned by private equity had ""suffered"" almost 600k job losses! 

The monetary system is how the financial sector and big banks control our economy.  They have more power than Congress and literally direct how capital flows and which sectors thrive or die.  The Federal Reserve is just an extension of Wall Street - the NYFED is a corporation with a board that is mostly bank CEOs or members of their board.  These people are responsible for bank supervision...  

I saw a popular post on here about a guy holding his $GME position.. It was titled: ""This is for you, Dad"". They were holding their position just to inflict any pain and losses possible on hedge funds.  Their explanation for this was the housing crisis and how it caused his dad to lose his business and a lot more, all while these funds were bailed out and their livelihoods unaffected by a crisis they helped create.  Unfortunately, his reasoning doesn't address the real culprit that caused his father's and families pain.. Along with millions of Americans.  

The Federal Reserve has created an economy for the Big Banks and their control - assets have literally only grown at big banks(mostly big four/six).  In fact, the Office of the comptroller of the currency quarterly report will show you FOUR banks control 155 TRILLION of the derivative market while ALL OTHER BANKS control 23 trillion.  

The 800 billion bailout for banks has been mentioned as well... Try 16 trillion(Google GAO audit) or 29 trillion(Link below) if we include currency swaps(which were for other countries not the banks).  The Fed created emergency facilties to specifically bailout banks and AIG.  These emergency facilties were managed by... WALL STREET.  In fact, 8 out of 10 of the highest paid contracts to manage facilities with taxpayer money to bailout themselves were given ""non-competitively"" - usually gov contracts have to provide a fair auction so they can't favor companies over another.  The Fed can just say these are ""unusual and exigent circumstances"" to bypass that.  They paid Blackrock over 100 million to help manage these facilties.  I think PIMCO was over 100 million too.  Then BofA and other banks were paid tens of millions as well.  The banks literally were involved in bailing out themselves.  They received trillions in lending by the Fed - Citigroup had the highest total at 2.6 trillion.  They literally had their toxic debt offloaded onto the Feds balance sheet.  It took the Fed 10 years to unload all of their ""Maiden Lane"" MBS purchases.  

Present day they bailed out banks in 2019 - before covid - with repo operations. 

From Wallstreetonparade.com 
""If the Fed had wanted the public to clearly understand that its repo loans were ongoing but had simply gone dark, it could have printed a statement to that effect on the daily page it posted showing zeros going out in repo loans. After reading the F-SOC revelation, we searched the New York Fed‚Äôs website for hours to see if it had ever made a public statement that it was going dark on the dollar amounts of its repo loans. We finally found this statement dated June 11, 2020:

‚ÄúBeginning with this month‚Äôs release, the Desk will no longer publish daily updates with the next business day‚Äôs operational details.‚Äù


The Fed's cumulative loans from Sep 2019 to mid March 2020 totaled over 9 trillion.  Half way into 2020 they stopped publishing.  However, as WSOP points out from the F-SOC the big banks are currently using 2.5 trillion of loans.  These are typically overnight or a few days. 

None of this is transparent because the NYFED is a corporation and is not subjected to FOIA - The board of Fed is but I tried getting records on the emergency facilties and they stated they do not have these records because the NYFED conducts the lending and facilties.  So, the trillions of bailouts in 2008-10 and in 2019 and 2020 are literally at a corporation and not the agency(Board) of government.  




Alright, I could go on for another 100 pages quite literally.. Let's get to the point.  

The only way to beat this system is to stop using it - practically impossible.  The only way to achieve that is to stop using Dollars... Also practically impossible.  However, a huge impact to the system would be to not hold any savings or any large holdings of dollars the banks.  It's imperative.  Investing in anything outside of dollars, debt in dollars, and any investments is necessary - holding savings in metals is one and there are many others(dig c) could actually inflict major problems IF many people actually committed to this.  If a few percent of Americans did this the banks would have huge problems.  

Nothing is going to change until we address the Federal Reserve.  Anything less is just a *game that won't *stop the pillaging of avg Americans from this industry.

Fintel's constantly changing stats for AMC,3654,lfcpce,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfcpce/fintels_constantly_changing_stats_for_amc/,343,1612822682.0,"I've been following fintel's reports for quite some time - way before I knew about AMC and GME.

Their reports have been quite accurate, but recently I've been noticing some shady activity that has made me raise an eyebrow.

To preface, I am usually not a conspiracy person myself. Even with all the weird movements this past week, I would not like to shout ""market manipulation"" until I'm completely sure there's something going on. Ironically, all this shady changes have been happening right before dissemination day (02/09/2021).

The first one I would like to point one is the one that makes the most sense to me:

My screenshot (02/05/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/laf5lci10fg61.jpg?width=1072&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a6849c1c430c3d2878213a1ee7dfc87b2eaba47b

Current report (02/08/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/xk8hlhj30fg61.png?width=453&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8aba006b33a4b703ca7eee7ed856f553a80dc98

The short volume ratio dropped drastically (twice). The second time it dropped is what you can see in the second image - i.e. the current report on Fintel. For the first drop, unfortunately, I don't have an image to prove it. But, what I do remember is that for the 3rd of February the percentage was 53% rather than 27%.

Regardless, what you can notice is that there is a noticeable change. This one I'm willing to blame on ""updating data"".

I presume short volume is not as simple to track as most of us believe and there is probably a large number of elements that can either spoof a system into believe that the numbers are much higher.

However, one thing that we can notice is (if this were true) how often Fintel updates their stats. My screenshot was on the 5th of Feb, and the current one (8th of Feb). This shows that Fintel has updated their stats twice in the span of 3/4 days.

Right, where things start to get fishy is when we look at the historical values of short volume over the past year.

My screenshot (02/06/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/gmcdpj160fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c0ee6ebdc7c597af71e347af5e07492fcb73fb9d

Current report (02/08/2021):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/uildby970fg61.png?width=890&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe9284081630cd1b25087b0fe69abaa112e7eaf3

As you can see the first screenshot I had taken shows that during there was a higher short volume in February compared to prior months. This was after the first correction that I had mentioned previously (the one I don't have a screenshot for).

In April of 2020, in the first screenshot the average short volume was recorded to be about 45% and now it's showing it to be above 85%. And February of 2021 is showing to be one of the lowest short volumes.

I get the short volume being updated regularly for day values. But for historical data? Especially with such a huge change? And all of this came out a few days before dissemination day?

There was a person on Stocktwits who claimed that he got his subscription cancelled, automatically, after reaching out to Fintel to ask them why are their numbers changing so rapidly and so often.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ld1mxyo90fg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a4774a3d9b9e2766576004cc50666ac9d5cfbcff

Here's the email he received.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/s04tukbb0fg61.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=812fbfea028d41767684ceef6e2c7eb65a87d5d7

Again, there might be a lot more complexities behind short volume calculations. But all of this seems like more than a coincidence.

Thoughts.

P.S I'm not a financial advisor just a smooth brained ape who doesn't like what he sees.

P.S.P.S I'm still holding strong!

Edit: A lot of people were asking what does this mean. It doesn't mean anything per se. It just shows that there is some odd movement happening with Fintel's platform. One of the top comments pointed out a conversation he had with Fintel:

""Thanks so much for reaching out to Fintel with your concern! You are right. Given the recent market activity we wanted to implement more data sources as a check, to gain a richer overview of stocks. Given this, we have revised some historical numbers. We announced this in the Welcome Group and on those pages. Sorry the message wasn‚Äôt up for longer - I imagine that was super confusing. We will replace it again. I imagine many subscribers did get to see it.

Are you certain the chart isn‚Äôt updating? That is an automated process. I appreciate you writing in so I could clarify. I‚Äôll resolve your ticket but I‚Äôm still here if you reply.""

I mean, this is possible. However, why now? Why after a year do they decide to go ahead an say ""oh yeah, let's update these statistics so we can show more ""accurate"" measurements to our users"". Ya know?

**Also, there might be a light at the end of the tunnel: Borrowing fees for AMC went up by 1% (currently sitting at 4.47% from the previous 3.5%. Usually an increase means that more people are borrowing shares to short.**

**Edit X2:** A fellow ape showed me that someone else over at the r/RubinoffButtChug69 made a similar speculation.

His post ([link](https://www.reddit.com/user/RubinoffButtChug69/comments/lfdcv1/fintel_changed_their_short_volume_data_after_my/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)) also points out that **Apple's stock has not been effected by any of this.**

And for all of you **asking about GME - the same post points out that GME also suffered from this. It's short volume got lowered by 50%.**

**\*\*\*UPDATE\*\*\***

This beautiful ape tweeted at Fintel referencing this post

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w4seq03r6cg61.jpg?width=1080&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=24808432116a21e6764ac9d1508faab3e26cd2c3

This is their response:

So their excuse is a ""programming error"". Fine, let's say that that's true for the daily short volume, right? But for the historical values of past months compare to February? And with the previous response they gave the other ape from WSB (if true).

I'm just sayin' feels like excuses to me.",2021-02-08 22:18:02

# [4 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/08/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-february-8-2021.html)

*****

> # 1. Wall Street set to rise after best week since November

> * Dow futures pointed to an over 100 points gain at Monday‚Äôs open, an advance that would exceed the 30-stock average‚Äôs closing record and could top its intraday all-time high, both of which happened last month. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq on Friday closed at record highs, while the Dow‚Äôs gain was about 40 points shy of a closing record as a disappointing January jobs report boosted hopes for further economic stimulus to help Americans and U.S. businesses during the pandemic. All three stock benchmarks logged their best weeks since November. The Reddit-fueled trading frenzy around short-squeeze names receded as shares of GameStop lost 70% last week, even with Friday‚Äôs 19% gain. The previous week, the video game retailer‚Äôs stock soared 400%. Shares rose 12% in Monday‚Äôs premarket trading.

*****

> # 2. Yellen says Biden stimulus could result in full employment next year

> * The U.S. economy could return to full employment in 2022 if President Joe Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue package were passed, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Sunday. Long-term unemployment is around a historical peak. While Biden has said he wants to get GOP support for his Covid relief measure, Democrats are taking steps toward passing his approach without any Republican votes. Republicans have opposed the $1.9 trillion price tag and called for lowering the income cap for receiving the full $1,400 direct payment.

*****

> # 3. Trump impeachment trial starts this week

> * Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, one of Donald Trump‚Äôs harshest Republican critics in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said Sunday he sees a conviction of the former president at his impeachment trial as ‚Äúvery unlikely.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs unprecedented second Senate impeachment trial will start on Tuesday. With a 50-50 split in the Senate, it would take 17 Republicans voting with every Democrat to convict. If Senate does so, it could also vote to bar Trump from holding office again or getting certain perks reserved for former presidents.

*****

> # 4. South Africa suspends plans to use AstraZeneca‚Äôs Covid-19 vaccine

> * South Africa has suspended plans to inoculate its frontline health care workers with AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine after a small clinical trial suggested it was not effective in preventing mild to moderate illness from the variant dominant in that country. The disappointing early results from the study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, indicated that giving the AstraZeneca vaccine may not be useful in South Africa. In the U.S., AstraZeneca‚Äôs vaccine has not been approved. Only vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have been approved for emergency use so far by the FDA. One from Johnson & Johnson will be reviewed later this month by the agency‚Äôs vaccine advisory committee.

We saw all 11 [SECTORS](https://imgur.com/pp8DYTh) finish the week in the green, with Energy leading the way followed by Consumer Discretionary, Communications & Financials also gaining more than 6% üöÄ

[Here](https://imgur.com/tRRK4fZ) is the HEAT MAP from last week, as we saw a hole lot of green in pretty much every sector, with big tech names gaining huge while the biggest lagging sector was Health Care. The big tech names just continue to [increase](https://imgur.com/96Q4J9w) their % of the SP market cap as technology is likely to continue to be one of the best performers in the next decades.

We also saw some interest economic data last week, as manufacturing continue to recover in January as both the [ISM](https://imgur.com/Q9ZPnxF) index and the [PMI](https://imgur.com/nVz0oDe) Index came in pretty solid and continued to stand in expansion territory.

Also, the [ISM](https://imgur.com/jgJ2IbI) Services Index came in better-than-expected rising above expectations due to an increase in employment & new orders.

In terms of Job numbers, we saw [ADP](https://imgur.com/a39dqcB) coming in way better than expected as over 170K jobs were added after a big drop in December. We also saw initial jobless [claims](https://imgur.com/ftMXubP) dropping even more than expected while the continuing jobless claims fell to under 4.6M last week.

This [WEEK](https://imgur.com/vLr3QHG) is pretty quiet in term of economic data, with core CPI, Consumer indexes and jobless numbers being the biggest ones while the [EARNINGS](https://imgur.com/PMP5olx) season continues with some of the most interesting earnings coming from Twitter, Coca-Cola, GM, Uber & PepsiCo while we also have to see how Disney subscriber numbers are continuing to evolve after hugely upgrading their expectations. One other thing that I am also interested to watch is the PayPal investors day on Thursday in which they are expected to provide a 3-to-5-year financial outlook.

In some other stock market [news](https://imgur.com/EcqHtMU), it seems that most of the RBNHD retail investors that have jumped ship are going to Square‚Äôs Cash APP with almost 40% of investors choosing the app. We have to see if this trend continues now, after [RBNHD](https://imgur.com/joQIln0) removed limits on all stocks, but regardless, I think Square is a nice FinTech play despite their huge valuation right now, as they will also benefit from the jump in digital currencies and more companies planning to increase investments in integrated POS providers just like Square üöÄ

We also had a lot of interesting earnings last week with Amazon [crushing](https://imgur.com/GILwN3r) expectations, beating by almost $7 and almost $6B on revenues as this was the first time Amazon passed the $100B mark in a quarter as the holiday & e-commerce demand combined to give Amazon a 44% increase y/y in sales. The other big [thing](https://imgur.com/WMmAddL) we got from Amazon was that Bezos will step down as CEO as Andy Jassy the current AWS leader will become the next CEO. This news caused some uncertainty for the company, but I believe this is still a long-term buying opportunity as Amazon will remain one of the best companies to own in the world üöÄ

Also, one of the biggest fintech companies out there, [PayPal](https://imgur.com/Klv5tD6) showed great strength in their numbers, beating both the top & bottom line as their total payment volume and new active accounts showed continued strength in the move to more & more online payments solutions üöÄ

The other big earnings report we saw last week was from [Alphabet](https://imgur.com/5BOUPT0), which also beat by more than $6 and $4B in revenues as they surprised most of the analysts with great beats in most of the segments as their operating margin came in 5% better than expected. The biggest income generator remained the Search & YouTube business as they are still investing huge in their Cloud platform that is still bleeding money, but is very likely to pay out in the long-run üöÄ

Other companies also smashed earnings with [Pinterest](https://imgur.com/0zB9SPh) beating expectations after a 76% revenue growth and a 37% user growth while [Ford](https://imgur.com/zerclC2), which was expected to post a loss, turned out positive earnings of $0.43 despite a 9% decrease y/y in total revenues, as the last 2 quarters of the year provided strong evidence that Ford is progressing into turning around the companyüöÄüöÄ

Meanwhile, though they didn‚Äôt have an earnings report, [COSTCO](https://imgur.com/6UmGJ7x) reported a rise in sales of almost 18% in January as the total comparable same store sales which rose by 15.9% crushed the analyst expectations of just 11.7%. I believe Costco is one of the best retailers to own despite it trading always at a premium, as the company is also jumping on the e-commerce trend, with a 107% increase in e-commerce sales in JanuaryüöÄ

And finally, let‚Äôs hope for a good day as the [world](https://imgur.com/itl9KxB) stock markets and the US [Futures](https://imgur.com/mlrfLz5) are pointing to a good open with the Nasdaq leading the way after the Treasury Secretary [pushed](https://imgur.com/jfKvaev) for more fiscal aid to help the economy & the unemployment fully recover as fast as possible.

"Discussion: Logically, GME short interest in the FINRA report should disappoint",779,lfa1vf,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lfa1vf/discussion_logically_gme_short_interest_in_the/,261,1612813207.0,"**Disclaimer: I am not an experienced trader and this is not financial advice. I'm looking for a (serious) discussion and you're more than welcome to prove my logic wrong.**

The much anticipated FINRA report is published tomorrow after market closes. We're still in the dark about actual numbers for short positions, and we don't know much about what the hedge funds are up to. However, the way I see it based on what we've witnessed so far, their main strategy is one  of these two:

Case 1 - heavy manipulation of the data and the stock itself. If they chose to employ this strategy, they've most likely deemed the potential cost of fines/lawsuits more manageable than the losses from an uncontrolled short squeeze. If this is the case the numbers we've been given are manipulated or straight up false and the majority of shorts have not been covered. Their survival relies on retail investors selling due to FUD. All of this falls apart if FINRA reports a high short interest  tomorrow. Their only reasonable option in this case is to keep lying; the FINRA report will show a low short interest.

Case 2 - they're already covering their shorts one way or another. If this is the case the hedge funds have been more honest than most of us give them credit for. The estimates for the short interest have had a strong trend downwards, and if the estimates are accurate the squeeze has probably been squoze. It went down from more than 100% to 50% in a matter of days and I wouldn't doubt that it'll be even lower when the report comes. In other words, even in this case the FINRA report will show a low short interest.

Even if reality is some mix between both cases, there is in my mind no way they'll report a high short interest tomorrow. Otherwise everyone will jump back in and we'll at least get a repeat of what happened 2 weeks ago (peaking at \~490). Essentially, if the FINRA report comes with low short interest all paper hands will have sell orders ready for when market opens. The hedge funds will certainly make use of that opportunity.

TLDR: FINRA report bad, stock collapses (possibly momentarily) on Wednesday.",2021-02-08 19:40:07

Where once I was fooled, I thought the **Jackals** were only on one side, I now see many who have left the path to join with the other Jackals. Stray from the narrow path to the moon and **get eaten**. The Jackals are always hungry and don't understand why, they will say anything for a meal, anything for you to come and join them, **in their misery**. 

The **Path to the Moon** has many twists and turns, Ups and Downs, it is important to remember this is an **energy flow at work**. As energy travels from A to B it passes through many positions and it is wise for you as any fish, to hold your desire, **hold your truth** and yours alone. Do not be fooled by the desires of the Jackals they do not know you, they do not have your interests at heart. **See your End** **clear when you have reached it**, their is no one else in this game but you. 

In truth it could actually be so much **easier, if we were one**. If there were no jackals. But this is the path we find ourselves on and a **hard truth** we must accept. I made a **little money** on my rocket to the moon but what I really gained from all of you I met on the path was **much wisdom**. I see that this little movement you guys made that could easily reshape the world, has quickly been turned by jackals into a **dark unfriendly path**. Much like the others before it. 

**Holding** onto that which **no longer serves you** does you no good. The jackals convinced you the bag was full, now you look and see that it is empty. Pesky jackals. If my right hand should bind me I would **cut it off** and be free and seek fresh opportunities, perhaps one day the flow might come around again, perhaps not.

$PCG (PG&E) - California Utilities DD,99,lf8e91,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf8e91/pcg_pge_california_utilities_dd/,91,1612805817.0,"**Position**: I purchased $PCG shares at $4.98/share and added to my position last week.  Also purchased $SRE and $EIX. 

**Summary**:

California utilities are undervalued ($SRE, $EIX, $PCG) and still down \~ 27% from pre-Covid levels.  I believe all are strong buys ‚Äì I have positions across the board. $PCG is my most bullish. I believe it is a very cheap entry point for a company that has proven to be bulletproof to regulators/oversight.

PGE Emerged from Bankruptcy with $25.5 B settlement

PGE should be eligible to reinstate dividend in 2022. Cheap entry into a growth stock with an expected reissuance of dividend.

Wild fire risks are low in winter, spring and early summer. 2020 was actually a very intense fire season but CA utilities mostly came out unscathed due to public safety power shutoffs (PSPS).  

1) **CA Utilities Undervalued**  
 The real BRRRR are utilities. They print their own money by capital improvement deprecation based on rate cases. Due to the 2018 wildfires and subsequent PSPS, utilities are getting authorized by California and Federal regulators to do more capitalized projects than ever. What does this mean? Revenues are going to be higher than ever. In the case of PCG, they hit the sweet spot in ineffectiveness. Doing so bad not to go bankrupt, but bad enough to get all their projects authorized by the state to maximize revenue.   Again, the California Public Utility Commission authorized the highest general rate case ever. 

2) **Bankruptcy Settlement**  
 $PCG‚Äôs market cap is $23.54B and has an outstanding bankruptcy $25.5 B settlement as of June 2020. Why is this significant? For one, the optics of having a valuation larger than your settlement liability flip (due to a $5.4 billion and partial $1.35B obligation) with February 25th earnings (unless the stock goes down by 20%) but more importantly, the settlement was incredibly favorable to $PCG.  

$PCG will likely post their highest annual revenue ever. EVER‚Äîsee item #1. This wouldn‚Äôt work in the real world (maybe banking in 2008), but in the California utility world, if you screw up you get more money. Fire happened 2018, 2017 $PCG had $17.14B in revenue. 2020 revenue might be as high as $18.71B. So likely 10% higher revenues two years after a colossal failure.  

This is why utilities are included in the Monopoly game. 

3) **Dividend and Leadership**  
 $PCG agreed to freeze their dividend until $6.2B in non-GAPP core earnings. This target can be met as soon as 2022‚Äînot much of a penalty all things considered especially with the cheap entry point for this stock (down 36% from pre-COVID, down 52% from post fire peak) 

Another settlement term was restructuring the entire leadership team. $PCG did that, and it‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre replacing Jason Garrett with Mike McCarthy. They got themselves someone with a proven record leading utilities in Patricia Pope, who signed a 5-year deal with PG&E starting January 4, 2021. She previously served as CEO for Consumer‚Äôs Energy which was known for safety. She‚Äôs also the first women to ever lead two Fortune 500 companies. This will be her first earnings call for PG&E. Her announcement caused a brief spike in the stock‚ÄîI expect the same with her first earning call (particularly with the positive numbers). 

4) **Wildfires**  
 Why buy now? Wildfire season is officially over now that CA received a ton of rain. This should be reflected in the risk for all utilities, but hasn‚Äôt resolved yet. 2020 was a very long fire season that lasted deep into January 2021. With all the PSPS and redflag warnings, I was hesitant to pull the trigger until CA was in the clear. I also positioned my call options to align w/ the beginning of 2021 fire season for a higher ROI if my strike price comes in. So in the clear for wildfires + new CEO + high earnings‚Äîgreat entry point.

**Potential** **obstacles**

There are pending investigations into some 2020 wildfires. Regardless of culpability, a big chunk of this will be covered by wildfire safety fund and won‚Äôt be anywhere near the 2017/2018 fires.

Operation and Maintenance costs/regulatory fines. Most costs are not capitalized, but most utilities know how to work around the regulators to get everything capitalized. There‚Äôs always the potential for additional fines, but they‚Äôd be pretty inconsequential.

Biggest obstacle: Everyone hates PG&E‚Äîlike hate hates them. But WSB seems to be cool with Martin Shkreli so there‚Äôs that.

**MOAT ‚Äì**   
 Ultimate Moat. They are bulletproof and there‚Äôs no point of entry other than acquisition. They provide infrastructure to transport power. Battery storage, solar, wind, gas, nuke, etc. all still use the same grid to transport. With higher EV demands and increase investment in fire hardening measures revenues will continue to climb.

**WHY WSB?**

Get that Money! Buy the utility you hate. If you‚Äôre in PG&E territory, buy the utility you hate and are obligated to pay.

**EDIT:**
Thanks for all the comments/feedback.  

**RE: $PCG hatred.**  
Hatred 100% valid‚Äîit‚Äôs not going away.  They‚Äôre pretty shitty.  My point is that the system has rewarded their ineptitude by forcing public investment into their business.  Those checks have already been signed and sent out.  
It‚Äôd be like if you were the only Uber driver in town.  You drive the car, charge your passengers, and then you get in a huge wreck because you thought brake pads didn‚Äôt need to be inspected/changed.  Instead of being out of a car and in jail, the state tells your passengers to pay for your repairs and give you a 10% bonus for calling the repair shop.  Does it pay to have a well-maintained car in this situation?  No! The best position to be in in this situation is to have a super shitty car that requires 15+years of repairs collecting 10% every year until the brake pads need to be replaced again and the cycle continues.  It‚Äôs a monopoly.

**RE WSB u/ DD**
u/angela_lansbury busted me.  I‚Äôve only been a user for 13 days!  Well, me and 80% of the users. 
That said, as long as I finally have a forum‚ÄîI have to express my gratitude to WSB.  I had no idea a community like this existed until $GME press.  I can‚Äôt tell you how much joy this group has given me and how much I‚Äôve learned.  It also got me out of bed at 6:00 every morning for the past 2 weeks.
My DD was tribute to this group.  I think there‚Äôs a good opportunity to get in to a very institutional position (utilities) for a discount.  Utilities are rigged‚Äîeveryone knows that.  But what is a rather recent discovery is that their shittiness is directly proportional to forced public investment.  The worse you do the more you get.  This model works pretty well for schools, roads, etc.  The difference is that guaranteed $10 for every $100 spent that goes right into the utility‚Äôs coffers.
This isn‚Äôt a back-the-truck up YOLO for me, it‚Äôs an investment I believe in.  I‚Äôm long on $PCG, but I also think there‚Äôs going to be upward pressure soon and wanted to share it with the group.

**Edit 2**
Just realized my comment responses were getting blocked.

**Re: Erin Brokovich**

In 1995 the stock was at $30.25/share, then cratered to $20 with the $333m settlement in 1996, and then was $35/share in 1998

Another example:
The 2010 pipeline explosion affected share price. Pre explosion $48/ share.  Dropped briefly to $43, then back up to $48/ share three months later.

**Re: new utilities for counties.**
CCAs are not utilities.  They still need to use and pay to use PGE equipment (poles, wires).  CCAs contract generation.

**Re: $4.89/share**.  Users properly ridiculed you. The stock is in fact > 52 weeks old

**Re: my prediction EOY**.  Tricky with fire season, but 1q earnings 2022 guess would be $20.  Don't know why it isn't $18 today.

Another point to mention is that SRE earnings come out 1 week prior to PCG and should set recovery pace.",2021-02-08 17:36:57

However, similar to GME's hold on the gaming shopping experience and console dominance, AMD has that same strength and capability being that they are powering the PS4 and Xbox, but more importantly the **PS4**!! I don't need to explain how the gaming industry has boomed, if ape need more look at **PENN** chart! Add in the fact, their highly highly profitable and beloved Radeon and Ryzen combo, like... I want to build a computer, don't know how to do it.... But if an autist like me can identify chips by the name Radeon and Ryzen and not ask if its a **Pokemon**, we str8! Even if you don't know what these chips are or do! Trust me, they generate tendies like your cam model crushes!

Fine, although its had multiple pullbacks and setbacks throughout the year I  believe NVDA earnings seems to be the catalyst where the big big explosion occurs throughout the whole sector. However, its going to be a slow rally till then. I encourage WSB to get in before its too late and you're questioning why all the autists decided to write their AMD DD after it jumped 10% !

I'm not a financial advisor, I just been like the stock, along with CRSR and i think the gaming industry is going to have a massive incoming cycle so its best to get on the rocket early. The market diversification has gotten a little sloppy with everything going with shorts, so AMD is just too underbought in reality, which leads to one usual explanation. **THE BOOMERS HAVE NOT BOUGHT IN AS MUCH AS THEY COULD YET**. Social media trading is only increasing and all it takes is one shift into seeing AMDs retard real life strength with their products and services and poof we'll be swimming in mint. I usually would say AMD is just an **options** play for me, but I actually recommend grabbing shares now as this is probably the highest floor you'll ever see a stock have. It would be dope to do more of these and hope this helps the culture moving forward... ya boy got the 9-5 tomorrow but dreams come first couldn't put enough rockets so comment them in for me so they can reach me in my slumber all the way in VALHALLA

AMC Major Stakeholder Wanda Converts Stock To Allow For Sale,435,lf73yi,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf73yi/amc_major_stakeholder_wanda_converts_stock_to/,154,1612800002.0,"A major Chinese investor in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE: AMC) converted its shares in the cinema operator in order to be able to sell them, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

What Happened: Wanda America Entertainment Inc, a unit of Beijing-based Wanda Group, converted its Class B common stock to Class A AMC shares on Feb. 1 'in order to permit sales of its common stock,' according to the filing.

No details of how much stock was converted were given out in the SEC document.

The Chinese conglomerate had acquired the majority stake in AMC for $2.5 billion in May 2012.

Why It Matters: AMC is still a majority-owned subsidiary of the Wanda Group, as per the latter's website.

The theater chain along with GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME), Blackberry Ltd (NYSE: redacted), and Nokia Oyj (NYSE: redacted) are targets of r/WallStreetBets, a Reddit forum, that has been carrying out a short squeeze in recent weeks.

The short squeeze has caused institutional short-sellers such as Melvin Capital and Citron Research to pose losses as they cover their shorts.

The Reddit investors received support from celebrities, investors, and others like Mark Cuban, Dave Portnoy, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, and others.

In late January, AMC shares shot up as much as 804% at one point. The stock is up over 200% on a YTD basis as of Friday's closing.

Price Action: AMC shares closed nearly 3.7% lower at $6.83 on Friday and gained almost 0.6% in the after-hours session.

I like GameStop.  I like $GME.  I believe in the long term plan (or what I/we think is the plan, anyway).  I bought a Pro Membership and have put in orders through the app I downloaded.  I think they'll kill 4Q earnings in March.

I THINK GAMESTOP IS A GOOD COMPANY.  I think Cohen and his team bring something to the table that will truly turn around the company.  I think CNBC and particularly Melissa Lee can go suck an egg with their dismissiveness of the bull case, which they barely even pretend to have considered.  I think the stock was and has been manipulated as fuck.

My personal belief, which I require nobody else to share, is that Ryan Cohen and gang also still have more buying to do, and their buying alone will drive the price up.  But my belief is that they have no interest in buying at this price, or they'd have done so.  I believe they're waiting for the price to fall back toward the fair market value.  And I believe they may force the issue by issuing more shares.  That's what I believe, and why I'm not holding positions right now.  I probably will in the future, but my personal opinion is the time is not right.

But you guys are actually fucking insane.  We dont have a problem with the stock.  We have a problem with YOU.

Many of the people who have joined WSB in the past two weeks are brand new to investing.  And that's okay!  But the new people (7 million new versus 1.5 million old) have done the following:

* Spent weeks downvoting every single ticker besides GME, AMC, BB, and NOK
   * Failed to realize there is no short squeeze on BB or NOK
   * Failed to realize the NOK spam was purely from bots
      * While you've realized there were bots that were bought, you missed (probably because you were spamming rocket emojis and gorillas) that the bots were spamming NOK.
   * Continually asked what stock WE are going to MANIPULATE next
* Tried to educate the crowd on terminology you just googled ten minutes earlier.
   * I saw one person disagreeing with a long-time and well-respected poster here by telling other Apes to ignore that post, and to instead read a copied and pasted two paragraph blurb from investopedia that explained the effect of a stock split on a short position.
* Made up securities laws and terminology that doesn't actually exist
   * Short ladders?  Every time a price falls from a peak it's a short ladder?  EVERY TIME?
   * You don't think that there's a natural reversion in the balance of supply & demand after a stock runs up thousands of percent in a matter of days?
* With zero understanding of market mechanics, explaining to others why price action is fake
   * ""Look how low volume is on this candle!  It's not a real drop!""
   * [the dip is fake](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lay22q/the_dip_is_fake_look_at_how_many_people_are/)
* Called people who have been involved in this play since Summer 2020 ""paperhand pussies"" for taking profits when the price of the stock went up 1,500%
* Turned WallStreetBets into a political activism forum
* Denying Reality
   * S3 partners is not lying to you.  They and Ortex are consistently the best sources of difficult-to-obtain information on short interest.  Just because they're reporting that short % of float is reduced FROM THE HIGHEST LEVEL THAT ANY STOCK HAS EVER HAD does not mean that they're lying to you.
* Spammed low-effort memes and easily-Googleable questions on the new submissions
   * When your posts were taken down, you posted AGAIN
* Accused anybody with an opposing opinion of being a hedge fund shill/bot
* AGGRESSIVELY spamming to find buyers to help you get out of your huge negative position
* I want to gag every time I see somebody write ""I'm not a financial advisor"" following a post that makes that very clear
* Moving the goalposts
   * ""YOU ARE HERE on the VW short squeeze graph!""
   * ""We finished above $325!  Gamma squeeze!"" (Personal confession, I almost fell for this one and I'm glad I sold before the plummet).
   * ""Ok so there was no gamma squeeze Monday but Tuesday is the day!""
   * ""Ok we fell another 50% Tuesday but definitely Wednesday!""
   * ""Fuck it let's just harrass investor relations to help us!""
* Accused the mods of being paid off by hedge funds for doing what they've always done, which is remove shit-tier posts from the front page
   * which you then posted again
      * and again
* Completely ignored the rules of our subreddit
   * Market Manipulation --
   * No Pump & Dumps -- pressuring other people to buy low float stocks (such as GME) so that you can drive up buying demand and sell when you've decreased your losses is a scam.
   * Political Bullshit -- If you think ""it's not about the money"" then get the fuck out because it is absolutely about the money.
   * No Bullshitting -- There are so many of you advising others on their trades (followed by ""This is not financial advice, am ape"") while you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about aside from something you just read on Reddit 5 minutes ago, which was posted by somebody else who had no idea what the fuck they were talking about, which was based on a tweet they read 10 minutes before that from someone who DID know what they were talking about, but OP misinterpreted the meaning.
      * Believe it or not, that's against the rules.  Just say you dont know.  Or say nothing.  There's actually no need to spam.
* Gain & Loss Posts - nobody wants to see your Loss on one-third of a share of AMC.  Come on.
* YOLO - Your investment in one-third of a share of AMC is not a YOLO.  A YOLO is DFV leveraging up his entire $55,000 account with positions in a single ticker and letting it ride or die.
   * [not a fucking YOLO -- it's a picture of a billboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la96zj/my_amc_billboard_is_up_in_kalamazoo_mi/)
* Drowned out a lot of really good content on non-GME stuff

   * I can't even find the others that I had in mind using the search tool because the entire list of YOLO's and DD's is filled with GME and AMC karma farming.
* And you've now begun brigading WSB from r/GME.

You have formed a cult.  You've now decided, amongst yourselves, that anybody who is not in on your play and wants to discuss other things is just a paid hedge fund shill.  Do you think that's a healthy mindset?

If this is the investment that you truly want to make, and you feel you have an understanding of the risks, then fucking ***let it rip.***  I hope it works out.  Seriously, I want you to make money.  I like Gain porn a lot more than Loss porn.

But stop bullshitting.  Stop brigading.  Stop spamming.

You're driving us nuts.

Geopolitics and semiconductors : Taiwan is leveraging TSMC/Qualcomm to force US confrontation on independence issue,107,lf5wgk,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf5wgk/geopolitics_and_semiconductors_taiwan_is/,114,1612794692.0,"So you‚Äôve probably heard the news of Taiwan being ‚Äúthanked‚Äù by America for alleviating chip supplies. But there‚Äôs some geopolitics behind this. 

There‚Äôs talk that Taiwan is essentially putting all cards on the table and push the issue of independence at all costs in a do or die effort. Essentially, Taiwan wants to pressure America into announcing full on Taiwanese independence and committing to it. This would be the culmination of the modern Taiwan issue, and essentially would be the end of the 2 Chinas status quo. 

This is basically a gamble by the Taiwanese hawks (DPP) who are willing to sacrifice their reputation and market share of TSMC in order to force support.

How? 

By forcing an artificial shortage of chips. This not only leads to shortage of automobile chips for Chinese companies, but also incentivizes America to give full support. Btw, EU feels betrayed on this especially since they supported a Taiwanese petition to block lithiogram machines. 

The reason Taiwan is playing chicken is because they feel there is a limited opportunity to force American commitment before China grows too powerful. Likewise, US hawks also want to force a confrontation since it‚Äôs ‚Äúnow or never‚Äù before China reaches peer state status.

TLDR:

- Taiwan is planning an artificial shortage of chips especially for the auto sector to pressure US into independent support.

- Geopoltics is prioritized over business practices, since market share could be lost and business relations strained as EU/China/Us companies feel alienated and untrusting.

- DPP is using TSMC/Qualcomm for geopoltics in a last ditch effort to force Biden admin on the China issue

I think Tesla (and daddy musk) has a long runway ahead especially if they‚Äôre going to grow productions 50% compounding YoY in auto sales which means that by Apple makes their first car in 2025, Tesla will be producing $2.5million electric vehicles. Their current automotive gross margins are 21% in comparison to 2.1% from Ford, gm, etc.

Tesla‚Äôs auto business: has a lot of potential and there‚Äôs a big runway in selling FSD which adds ~80% margin to every sale. 

Tesla insurance: they‚Äôre hiring actuaries everywhere so they can sell insurance to Tesla owners. One of the most important thing that ALL insurance companies want to know is HOW you drive. Usually they‚Äôll give you some discount to put in an obd sensor in your car for a few months and give you a rate accordingly. Now imagine a car that already does this so they know every action the driver takes and can understand risk every second on the road. Imagine an insurance company that can gather all camera feeds from the cars to evaluate accidents/damage claims and pass savings down to the customer. Win win. Huge potential.

Tesla Solar: with the new administration and their focus on renewable, solar will be front and center. With an existing relationship with over 1.3 million auto customers, Tesla will easily convert many of them to solar owner - FYI Tesla has the cheapest solar by a long margin. If even 10% of the total households in the US get basic solar added it‚Äôll equate to over $1T in yearly revenue.

Violent demand incoming for uranium - why Cameco CCJ,0,lf51ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf51ks/violent_demand_incoming_for_uranium_why_cameco_ccj/,42,1612791204.0,"Over the last 10 years, uranium prices have fallen like a rock. They look like your portfolio before you discovered WSB. Like anything that needs to be extracted from the ground (oil üõ¢, gold üèÜ, etc), falling prices often mean permanent production shutdowns. But it‚Äôs time for that to turn around. [Excerpt](https://www.barrons.com/articles/covid-19-has-slammed-the-energy-sector-heres-a-hot-commodity-that-could-keep-rising-51589536800):

*Going into 2020, global nuclear utilities were expected to require roughly 182 million pounds of uranium concentrate to run reactors for the year, while expected global mine production was seen at 142 million pounds, he says. The pandemic has affected 50% of global uranium mine supply, or over six million pounds a month, so even a three-month loss would push production down to just over 120 million pounds this year, he says.*

Uranium isn‚Äôt like oil, you can‚Äôt buy significant amounts on the open market - reactor operators often have significant supply contracted out for decades. We‚Äôre at the point in the uranium cycle where reactor operators are beginning to open new contracts for supply into the next decade. And the best part is that price runs on uranium can be extremely violent, see [this chart](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/uranium) from the last time uranium went to the üåï from 2003-2007. Prices spiked from $25/lb to a peak of $140/lb. Excerpt from $CCJ filings:

*Uranium rallied 30% from March lows. Price upswings are normally violent and self-reinforcing because: ""History demonstrates that in general, when prices are rising and high, uranium is perceived as scarce, and a lot of contracting activity takes place. The heavy contracting that takes place during price runs, drives investment in higher-cost sources of production.""*

So much production was shut down in 2020 due to COVID that many producers have had to buy uranium on the spot market. As demand continues to outstrip supply, we might see a uranium bull cycle even crazier than that of the 2007 bull run.

What are the best tickers to express a long uranium bet? If you‚Äôre subscribed to [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/), you could buy $URNM like a fucking loser. But why would we do that? I've lost money on $JNUG, I know not to play with small junior miners.

Call me a boomer but I prefer big established companies like **Cameco (ticker $CCJ)**. It‚Äôs been around for decades, and has lasted through multiple downturns. It has a market cap of $5B and even pays out a small dividend! We‚Äôre not fucking dividend investors though. My point is that Cameco is responsible for nearly 10% of global uranium production so **it‚Äôs not going anywhere**. Contracts to receive uranium with them are comprised of 40% fixed price and 60% spot - meaning that if prices of uranium on the open market moon üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ, you‚Äôll see the same for their revenues.

Since no one knows when the SQUEEZE is going to happen, I suggest you buy shares or LEAP calls. Don‚Äôt gamble what you‚Äôre not willing to lose. That‚Äôs why I recommend somewhat OTM LEAP calls because of the long-term nature of this play.

&#x200B;

**""Ladder""** is a term for an investment technique that requires investors to purchase multiple financial products with different maturity dates.

&#x200B;

*Legal Laddering ex:*

>***Bond Laddering*** can also be used as an overall retirement planning approach for all retirement investments. The idea is to separate CDs, cash, bonds, annuities, and others into different ""ladders"" (or ""buckets"" or ""baskets"") depending on when the asset is expected to be liquidated to fund the retirement revenue stream. Low-risk assets are used at the start of retirement (and usually have an expected lower rate of return, due to lacking a risk premium). Higher-risk assets would be placed in a basket used at the end of retirement.  
>  
>This strategy is useful for a diversified portfolio, with other assets in the stock market etc. Generally an initial investment of $10,000-$20,000 is required in order to purchase 5-10 bonds with different maturities for a specific timeline.

&#x200B;

>***Short Put Laddering or Bull Put Laddering*** is a unlimited profit, limited risk strategy in options trading that is employed when the options trader thinks that the underlying security will experience significant volatility in the near term. To setup the short put ladder, the options trader sells an in-the-money put, buys an at-the-money put and buys another lower strike out-of-the-money put of the same underlying security and expiration date.

&#x200B;

*Illegal Laddering ex:*

>***IPO Laddering*** also describes a process where, in order to purchase shares at a given price, investors must also agree to purchase additional shares at a higher price. This artificially inflates the price of the stock and allows insiders to buy at the lower price, with a guarantee that they will be able to sell at a higher price. **This practice has resulted in investigations of national and global banks by the SEC after the stock market collapse**.

\--------------------------------------

OK that was fun. We know a little more about a common term in investment strategy in ""Laddering"". We know that IPO Laddering was deemed illegal and reported on at length; where a party is able to artificially set the price of a stock by forming an agreement with another party that underwrites the retail price.

Now in the more in-depth version of the ""Short Ladder Attack"" article written \~6 years ago that's lately been passed around, the author describes at length how ""Naked Shorts"" can be combined with ""Laddering"" strategy to artificially set the price of a stock via shares not actually owned by either party. This is effectively what the blogger coined as the ""Short Ladder Attack"" strategy.

\------------------------------------

>***Naked Short*** ‚Äî This is an invention of the securities industry that is a license to create counterfeit shares. In the context of this document, a share created that has the effect of increasing the number of shares that are in the market place beyond the number issued by the company, is considered counterfeit. This is not a legal conclusion, since some shares we consider counterfeit are legal based upon today's rules. The alleged justification for naked shorting is to insure an orderly and smooth market, but all too often it is used to create a virtually unlimited supply of counterfeit shares, which leads to widespread stock manipulation‚Äîthe lynchpin of this massive fraud.  
>  
>***The Anatomy of a Short Attack*** ‚Äî Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.  
>  
>The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill‚Äìgotten gain. (Click here for more on [**Bankrupting The Victim Company**](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CS4BankruptingTheVictimCompany.html)).  
>  
>When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

\------------------------------------

tl;dr - focusing on the terminology for ""short ladder attack"" is pedantic; what's being described is the combination of a Laddering price manipulation tactic combined with Naked Shorts. Both of those things are things.

I'm pretty retarded so I can't personally really imagine one being able to actually form a real case given data available to the public, or even those with terminal access. You'd need a real investigation with the power to subpoena data from the source.

Yes, the concepts described in the ""Short Ladder Attack"" article are real things. You can call it a number of things, but it's effectively a similar tactic to all ""laddering"" via shares neither party actually owns.

No, that doesn't mean that's definitely what happened w/ GME.

And No, you don't need a smoking gun to ask the SEC to investigate it.",2021-02-08 13:22:48

PDC Newsletter: Trading Week Ending 2/12,160,lf3ndh,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf3ndh/pdc_newsletter_trading_week_ending_212/,56,1612786192.0,"Dear Member,

Hello fellow degenerate gambler! May I introduce you to the Pretty Decent Crew's newsletter for the trading week ending on February 12th? We hope that this email finds you well and not dead from the Meme Stonk War of 2021.

Compared to the last few weeks, we have a relatively boring week coming up. Our primary goal is to move our assets into areas that will produce steady gains. I have two focuses with this.

1. Use the current situation to optimize gains through high risk and volatile stocks that could shoot us in the foot.
2. Acquire holdings that will let us cash in on the technological transition over the coming years
3. I know, it was intended to be two, but let's be real. We are definitely going to hold out buying power for options on the Disney earnings report!

My first thoughts here are that our situation doesn't allow for high quality options trading given that there are huge transitions occurring within the retail investor. We have a horde of idiots moving on from GME, AMC, BB, and NOK. They have no idea what to do other than go back on the Palantir train. With these things in mind, we're going to make a couple safer plays this week and minimize new options.

Worth noting, but not detailed this week is a movement of long holding funds into ARK related ETFs (including PRNT). After reading through ARK's Big Idea's 2021, I truly believe their ETFs are going to obliterate the S&P over the coming 6-12 months. This is heavily dependent upon how much innovation occurs and is facilitated by the government. If the current trend continues, they're going to average well over 20% this year due to the needs of companies moving into new sectors of technology. I don't know which will be the most notable; so, I've chosen to hold all of their assets.

&#x200B;

* DIS (The Mouse)
   * It's time to bet the house on The Mouse. With earnings coming up after hours Thursday 2/11, they're going to continue their pop they've been showing over the previous week. It's VERY tough to tell where they're going to end the week, but this is a prime opportunity to do some quality percentage gains on OTM calls. If you're looking at high premiums, make sure you're careful to play the higher traffic options so that you don't get burned. I'll personally recommend steering clear of the $200 number unless you're willing to risk it all. Disney clearing the $200 mark this week would be massive. The lower premium makes it enticing, but it won't happen unless their subscriber numbers are through the roof. For me, I'm shooting for $190 in hopes of getting a quality OTM to ITM transition and then dumping it at open on Friday.

&#x200B;

* CVS (You know you want to do it...)
   * WIth earnings coming up 2/16, they're expected to crush the estimated earnings. The problem here is of course: ""are the earnings already priced in?"" You know what? Maybe they are, maybe they aren't. CVS fluctuated over $2.50 in price over the last week alone ($71.50 - $74.00). I'm going to dig deep and hit the $75C for 2/19 in hopes of a solid outcome on earnings. Will this happen? I'm going to say yes, BUT I wouldn't expect it to hold. Both Walgreens and CVS stock have been more volatile than usual given the hopes they receive approval as vaccine distribution locations. I'm going to hold the calls in hopes of a solid pop and then dump them all when there are high hopes of a solid close on 2/19.

&#x200B;

* MARA + RIOT
   * I'm going to double down on these two because of the general adaptation occurring throughout large corporations. There is no reason to think this will die off. The limited supply of Voldemort and ""the halvening"" that occurred in the last year will also contribute to a continued rise in Voldemort demand.
   * According to ARK, if companies move ONLY 1% of their free cash into Voldemort, it will rise by $40,000. Now this is a long stretch, but if they moved to 10% of free cash into Voldemort, it would jump by $400,000. This seems unrealistic right now, but 1% is absolutely possible. Multiple companies including Square have already adopted this concept with great success.
   * MARA is successfully moving up this week towards new ATHs. Voldemort will likely continue to rise over the coming year. The play here is obviously not short term returns. The play is holding a company that will be worth 2-3x in the coming years.
   * RIOT is now right back on track with its three month moving average. The volatility here is inevitable given the movements in Voldemort and associated Voldemort infrastructure.

&#x200B;

* CCIV
   * CCIV crushed last week and I'm going to double down on this too because Lucid and CCIV refuse to acknowledge or deny the rumors of their merger/acquisition. If I were a gambling man (I am), I would hold a small stake of CCIV shares as I hold deep OTM calls with a heavy Theta. At a $50 strike, you will pay 10% extra for the 8/20 calls over the May calls. May could be a tight race to guarantee the acquisition is occurring. August gives us a strong theta and will allow it to grow.

Feb 9th GME Short Interest Data,231,lf1y46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf1y46/feb_9th_gme_short_interest_data/,215,1612780206.0,"I have some theories about the  short interest data coming out 2/9 that will include shorts that have settled by 1/29. 

If shorts settle T+2, and it‚Äôs only reporting shorts settled by 1/29, that would be trades executed 1/27 or before.  Missing any data from that Thursday fuckery by Robinhood etc and the following Friday with the all time high. 

Between 1/14-1/21 it traded in a very tight range 38.00-44.00 with good volume. Could that have been people covering their shorts. Is it possible the run up in price was actually just momentum off of the 1/22 trading day jump(which could of been caused by large shorts being covered and HFs booking losses). If you go back to that week and search for news regarding GME by each day. On 1/22 you see a giant spike in GMe articles, media talking about it, Jim Cramer tweeted out 1/22 that GME was a squeeze of a life time etc. this Reddit blew up etc. Will look for a large decrease in shorts to confirm that theory  but..

anyone who shorted the stock from 1/25-1/27 is going to add to the short interest number in the 1/29 report. Any shorts established between 1/25-1/27 made huge profits last week and could of been covered. Meaning the short interest data would show shorts that may actually not exist anymore. 

Because the market is reacting 100x faster to GME moves than it was prior to the 1/15 data is SI data becoming less powerful as a predictor?

The company has been recognized for innovation; for example it has developed technologies that allow mobile phone batteries to be made at room temperature rather than in expensive, heated dry rooms.

In 2010, BusinessWeek ranked BYD the eighth most innovative company in the world [\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-businessweek-30) and that same year saw Fast Company ranking BYD as the 16th most innovative.[\[31\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BYD_Company#cite_note-fastcompany-31)

Why to REALLY buy GME (Solid DD),2151,lf023x,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lf023x/why_to_really_buy_gme_solid_dd/,283,1612774092.0,"LEGITIMATE ARGUMENT TO INVEST IN GME AT THESE PRICES (Short sqeeze and hype aren't reasons). 

Sherman started a turnaround of Gamestop when he first took over April 2019. He cut the dividend, began consolidation (cut some fatty stores), and began debt reduction. COVID threw a wrench in this because he didn't move online nearly fast enough. 

When Burry first invested in GME, there was a reason. What reason? He spoke with Sherman about his plans and thought they wouldn't just survive, but thrive. Cohen also had a similar situation, and later of course he got involved. Sherman listens to both, and in their letters to him they basically tell him where he fucked up and how to move Gamestop forward. 

Fils-Aim√© the Nintendo guy that likes to turn companies around is added to the board. He turns stuff around as a hobby and is an insanely good marketer. This is shown in particular with his Nintendo of America endeavors. u/kitrosreddit told me not to forget about Reggie so I didn't this time (sorry to the 100ish people that saw this a few days ago) 

Next up we see the Microsoft deal. Although exact numbers aren't available that I can find, Gamestop will be receiving a royalty from gaming equipment sold via Microsoft. Microsoft is also expanding Gamestop's inventory on the inside and employees will use Microsoft software to run the stores. Microsoft doesn't want Gamestop to fail, nor will they let them. With 27% of new games bought at Gamestop and 40% of used games bought there, Microsoft saw an excellent way to try and compete this console cycle. 

We recently saw Gamestop's holiday earnings. With a yearly revenue of roughly $7 bil, they were unprofitable this year. The current P/S ratio makes no sense unless it is expected to go out of business (good luck) or that it will not grow significantly over the coming years (lol). However, this is expected to change with earnings starting in March. They are expected to continue to be profitable moving forward as well. Gamestop still has roughly $500 mil in debt. How are they going to pay this off!!!??? Liquidating stores and consolidation. This was a Cohen continuation idea that Sherman had started, just without the vision to make it succeed. A small stock offering (let's say 2%) would also leave them in an excellent financial situation. Additionally, we have the 300% YOY online sales increase, which accounted for over 30% of total sales. This is only expected to increase moving forward. While overall sales decreased by 3% YOY, inefficient stores were cut out of the picture. Comparative store sales increased by 5% YOY, but this was even stagnated due to state restrictions on 'nonessential' businesses. Places that had significantly fewer COVID numbers had over 30% YOY growth. 

Next, we have the Chewy powerhouses joining the board of directors. Out with the old, in with the new. Even though most directors were acquired in 2020, these new additions add incredible value to the company. Sherman listens to Cohen. Cohen and friends had some focuses at Chewy that led to insane amounts of profit. They focused on cutting costs and maximizing efficiency. Expect the same for Gamestop. This was something that can be effectively implemented with all the new leadership. All ears are on Cohen and his ideas to make Gamestop a 1 stop gaming shop. 

Most recently were the adds on 2/3/21 Francis: That AWS engineering guy that's now heading technology!? Nice. Durkin: Customer service VP from Chewy is now in charge of Gamestop's customer service!? Fuck yes Chewy has insanely good customer service. Krueger: Big filler boi from Amazon et all now running e-commerce fulfillment!? Dope.

Conservative price target: $200 by mid 2021 with little hype and absent a short squeeze

Tldr: Idc about a squeeze or hype but I like the stock. 

But what do I know I'm literally retarded and not a financial advisor... positions 5200 shares GME, 52x covered calls sold exp 2/12, 50x calls bought exp 2/26, a few bucks in cash waiting for a drop if it happens. Tell if I'm wrong somewhere with sources linked please and thank you.

Edit: As requested, my average cost is roughly $60 after buying back in late last week. I had original shares at an average buy in of about $30 assigned to covered calls on 1/29. I believed the company had too much downside at those prices.

Is AMC at the current price ($6.83) a good deal?,186,leydor,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leydor/is_amc_at_the_current_price_683_a_good_deal/,193,1612768766.0,"Some of you are of the belief that AMC is post-pandemic value play. And that once the pent up demand for seeing movies in theaters is unleashed that AMC will be revitalized and soaring back to it's $30 share price from a few years ago. There is one big problem with that - AMC is already valued well above what it was leading up to the pandemic. 

For AMC to reverse course, soaring back to it's 2017 highs - a $3.27 billon market cap - that's really only about $9.41 a share based on todays number of shares outstanding. 2017 had also seen operating revenue soar from $3.2 billion to $5.0 billion (growth that it came nowhere near sustaining). The following 2 years had $5.4 billion in revenue along with increasing long term debt. 

[https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#)

Silver Lake converting $600 million of notes into equity was certainly a fortunate turn of events for AMC.  While this may take bankruptcy off the table,  there are still [debt problems](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-debt-soars-as-company-claims-to-have-staved-off-bankruptcy-62274670) remaining.  Long Term debt had already more than doubled between [2017 and 2019](https://investor.amctheatres.com/financial-performance/financial-highlights/default.aspx#) \- from $4.8 billion to $9.7 billion. 

I at one point bought into the AMC hype and that it would be heading for the moon - and for a moment it did. The reality is that if you bought in under $4 you've already done very well - and perhaps far better than you should have expected. 

Even AMC at $4.50 values the company about where it was January 2, 2018. Pre-pandemic, pre-Silver Lake loan and almost $5 billion less in long-term debt.  

Do you what you want.

GME FINRA short volume data,63,leyc9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leyc9v/gme_finra_short_volume_data/,27,1612768635.0,"We  have a bunch of posts that base some theories off the FINRA short  volume data. This post is just a quick reminder that the FINRA data has  some conditions:

If you read through the 05/2019 Information Notice ([https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019](https://www.finra.org/rules-guidance/notices/information-notice-051019)) they state that the data:

""(1)  does not include any trades that are not publicly  disseminated, (2) is  not consolidated with exchange data, and (3) does  not‚Äîand is not  intended to‚Äîequate to short interest position  information. ""

In  general the short volume overstates the actual short position volume. A useful check are the  exchange short volume numbers from marketbeat for instance ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/)).

For example the total short sold volume as reported by the exchange ([https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/))   - \~61.8Mil -  for the week ending 1/15 does not match either the total   short volume reported by FINRA (for all exchanges) - \~84.5Mil- or even   just for NYSE - 24.7Mil.

Also, the Total Volume combined for all exchanges from FINRA for let's say the 22nd Jan (97Mil) is smaller than the one reported by the exchange \~195Mil which agrees with the Yahoo number.

For a Buy or Sell for  instance - there may be multiple trades behind the Buy that need to be  made to deliver or sell your shares - including maybe a short sale or  two. Now these shorts will be covered quickly, but they still show up in  the FINRA numbers - I think these complex trade chains are root of the  problem.

Like  always if I am wrong let me know and I can either take this down or  edit it appropriately. I just want us to be better informed.",2021-02-08 07:17:15

Why RITE AID is (RAD) not BAD,51,lexqun,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lexqun/why_rite_aid_is_rad_not_bad/,41,1612766923.0,"Hello :-)

I am back today to share my DD on a company I have long loved but only recently started investing in. Posting this today so people can invest tomorrow if they want.  My timing is usually poor for posting my findings.

**RITE AID (RAD)**

Okay I know, robinhood is showing you it was .50 a year ago and you‚Äôre saying fuck idk about this one, it looks like I missed it.  It‚Äôs okay though, robbingyouhood is just lying again.  The truth is that rite aid had a 1:20 **reverse stock split** artificially X 20 the price.

*WHAT DOES THIS MEAN*

It means we can assume two things, rite aid has only doubled in price since its mediocre deal with Walgreens fell through.  They have trimmed the fat and beat earnings the last three quarters.

Rite aid is starting vaccinations on February 12th, along with other pharmacies.  I believe they will be seeing a significant increase in revenue.

*PROMISING NUMBERS*

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/RAD/financials/annual/balance-sheet

For those that can‚Äôt read, this tells us that rite aid is seeing close to **TWENTY FOUR** billion in revenue a year and is only being valued at a little over ONE billion at the current stock price.  They‚Äôre looking at over 6 billion in property and two billion in inventory.  

**WHAT DO I DO**

I am very bullish on Rite Aid, but I would also consider this a long term play.  I own 1000 shares and a bunch of calls spread out.  I expect a bump next week as vaccine/corona cycles back into the news.  

I also believe Rite Aid is undervalued.  It *should* be trading at 50$ right now.  It has potential to be trading at ~100.

And >50% of the 54million shares are held by institutions, with 20% being used to short.

20x 34.5 2/19 c is my immediate play

Edit: my position is 24.5 c I am as they say retarded",2021-02-08 06:48:43

I‚Äôve done a fair amount of ‚ÄúDD‚Äù on AMC, but this is more conceptual potential based off news articles. Don‚Äôt expect math or grounded market concepts from this since that‚Äôs pretty far out of my trading style. Although, here are some key factors that have made me vary bullish on AMC before all this artificial price inflation.

Let talk about the AMC is a dying business concept. I don‚Äôt believe that in the slightest. I mean yes it‚Äôs much easier to stay and home and stream new movies, and yes a lot of big name producers have been dabbling with the straight to streaming release concept. Although, most of the titles being released straight to streaming have been smaller budget titles that weren‚Äôt expected to pull huge crowds in theater. With the exception of the new Wonder Woman and Pixar movies. That being said the budget for WW was 200 million and for Soul it was over 150 million. These budgets are common place for big block buster now a days. A fraction of $7-$12 subscription fee would likely have profits that would break even on budgets this large. Defiantly when you factor in costs of other movies and original content that is also in production. No movie producer is looking to break even on budget costs. They want huge profits margins which are mostly realized in box office sales.

This brings us to the life cycle stage of movies and how it maybe changing for the better going forward. The life cycle of a movie after production is typically: 

Theaters, on demand/Blue-ray, streaming services, and lastly day time tv.
Box office sales are typically where most of the profit is realized. On demand and blue-ray are worth mentioning, but the second biggest income is obviously stream services renting the rights to have them on their platforms. No matter how you look at this eliminating the box office releases is just throwing away millions in potential profits. It really doesn‚Äôt make sense to do that. Especially with this new game changing deal that was recently struck with Universal studios. [Here‚Äôs the article ](https://qz.com/1885992/universals-deal-with-amc-is-huge-for-the-movie-industry/)
This basically says that the amount of time for a theatrical release will be weeks instead of months. This deal was actually a power play by AMC where they said they wouldn‚Äôt show anymore Universal Studios movies in their theaters if Universal started doing more straight to streaming releases. Obviously there was a compromise reached in the interest of both parties, but it goes to show that a big name like Universal Studios values the box office greatly. Also, this deal opens up so many door for even platforms like Netflix to release their more notable movies in theater first. Netflix has in the past considered theatrical releases but could never agree on the 90 day release timeframe.

Next, I should talk about how AMC‚Äôs stock price has fallen so low based off the fact that they were teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Basically, AMC has been selling stock and taking loans to give itself just the smallest amount of runway to keep afloat for another month. Although, now talk of bankruptcy is in the rear view window. This is widely due to you delinquents blowing up their stock‚Äôs value. 
[Here‚Äôs another arrival on that](https://www.google.com/amp/s/deadline.com/2021/01/amc-entertainment-silver-lake-swaps-debt-for-equity-as-cinema-chains-stock-surged-1234682417/amp/) 
Now they went from having a month or so of runway to enough to last them well into 2021. That‚Äôs not to mention a lot of movie deals that are reaching into as far as 2023. 

I might be missing some recent news points, but these factors; along with the fact that vaccines most likely being available to the general public in a few months, gives me a lot of hope for AMC‚Äôs future. My DD is pretty bare minimum and fuck if I know if they are viable for a short squeeze? Even if they aren‚Äôt I‚Äôm sure they will get some attention in the hype if GME still has a chance. None of this is financial advice by the way. All in all I just like the stock.

TLDR, 
1) Block buster movie budgets are $100‚Äôs of million and box office revenue is always just going to be extra millions of profit.
2) New movie deals will bring 90 day theatrical release windows to 17 days. Making theaters even becoming approachable for platforms like Netflix.
3) Threat of bankruptcy is pretty much gone. Plenty of runway funding for the future.

$KO is one of those companies that were hit by the pandemic. As you may or may not know, their primary source of income is not the 15 bottles you swig every day, rather the franchise deals they make with restaurants, stadiums, $AMC, and so on, and in case you haven't noticed, these things have been shut down for a while, which means bad numbers.

However, with all the vaccinations going on, and Biden winning the presidency, soon Covid will be a thing of the past:

What this means is $KO will soon be swimming in money again. If you're quick you can get in before the smart money picks up on these obscure clues.

Check your countries individual tax laws before spending any money or making any deductions. Calculate your tax obligations before spending a cent.

$VSTO DD- A great value play (Vista Outdoors),135,levgwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/levgwx/vsto_dd_a_great_value_play_vista_outdoors/,85,1612760542.0,"**TLDR: Ammo sales/backorders are currently the highest they have ever been, and the market has not reacted yet**

Let me start by saying that I am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice. However, I am a ‚Äúgun guy‚Äù and regularly shoot a lot (~20,000 rounds a year) and compete in shooting sports (USPSA, 3 gun, Steel Challenge, etc). I hold 100 shares of VSTO as well as 10x Feb 19 $35c and 2x Jun 19 $35c. I plan to buy more shares on any dips below $30, and I will explain why.


Some background:
In case you are as unaware as the cuck analysts on Wall Street apparently are, there is a nationwide gun and ammo shortage. Why do you care? The company Vista Outdoors (VSTO) is publicly traded on the NYSE. VSTO owns the ammo manufacturers Federal Ammunition, CCI, Blazer, Speer, American Eagle, and they just bought Remington‚Äôs ammunition plant after they went bankrupt. (imagine going bankrupt during the largest gun/ammo demand period in history, lmao). Besides ammo, they also make primers, brass, and other components. Primers are even harder to get than loaded ammo right now, because the manufacturers are using the primers to service their own needs first. The wide consensus across the industry is that things won‚Äôt return to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (i.e. you can walk in a gun store or go online and buy ammo/primers at normal prices) for at least several years. VSTO owns the largest market share of American ammo manufacturing, followed by Winchester (Olin Corporation, OLN).


The fundamentals:
First and foremost, VSTO is a value investment. Some key metrics that make it a buy IMO (taken from ETrade data):

Price to sales: 0.86x (this means you are paying 86 cents for $1 of sales, that‚Äôs insane in a cyclical industry)
Price to book: 2.43x
Price to cash flow: 4.64x
And most importantly: Price to earnings. Now, the current number is 33.59x. This is including the quarter from a year/9 months ago where they barely turned a profit (Trump was still president, no coronavirus, no nationwide political unrest, etc).


Looking forward:
Forward P/E is difficult to estimate due to lack of analyst coverage, but if you look at the last two quarters and push forward only six months at the same/similar earnings (approx. $1 per share), you get a forward P/E of 13.5x!!
For the TA retards, if you look at historical charts, you will note that VSTO traded at $44-$50 throughout the tail end of the Obama presidency. Note that those prices were maintained when they were reporting EPS of approx.. 0.60 cents per share. Once Trump was elected and ammo demanded dropped off significantly, the stock price got hammered. (Again, they just reported two quarters in a row of over $1 per share in earnings.)


Ammo demand: according to shooting podcasts and other industry media I follow, Federal alone has over $1 BILLION worth of back orders right now. Other reports state that they currently have more outstanding orders than they got during the ENTIRE 8 year Obama presidency. Do the math for what that will look like once the market picks up on this.
Couple that with that fact that gun sales have been skyrocketing for the last year. New gun owners=more people buying ammo


Risks:
Biden administration passing/signing HR 127 into law, which introduces a shitload of retarded restrictions on ammo purchases by consumers. However, this will cause an even greater near-term spike in demand

Copper and lead prices continue to rise in relation to the inflated dollar (low risk, generally when suppliers raise prices the ammo manufacturers raise their prices too)

These are the reasons I think VSTO is the superior play on the ammo shortage- opposed to OLN, which is a much smaller market share, less profitable, and lower quality ammo in general, and P O W W, which I had never heard of until a week ago, and I still can‚Äôt figure out what brands of ammo they actually own (thats a big red flag)",2021-02-08 05:02:22

Buying calls for the run up is the play here. Their price normally peaks the week before earnings so 2/19 expiry is probably better since it‚Äôs cheaper will offer higher returns.

"Blackrock, the largest asset manager in the world, increased their ownership of Zynga to 5.2% last week",350,lev73v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lev73v/blackrock_the_largest_asset_manager_in_the_world/,63,1612759774.0,"https://fintel.io/so/us/znga/blackrock

Why is this of note? 

Chinese capital firm Keybanc reported last month that Tencent is raising large amounts of money for a purchase, with Zynga being among the possible targets.

Blackrock and Tencent are already working together on ways for Tencent to gain more market share in China.

So, why does the 5% matter? 

If you own a single share in a stock, you can have voting rights when it comes to major decisions the company makes. The more shares you have, the more your vote counts. If you own more than 5%, you get special voting rights and a 5% or more share-ownership signifies that the owner intends to be an active participant in the stock, rather than a passive one.

In addition, dark pools have been active on Zynga for months now with large purchases coming in almost daily. For those who don't know about dark pools, this is a quick primer:
 https://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp?

I'm thinking Blackrock wants to make sure it gets a say in any decision regarding Zynga and they've been doing it as quietly as possible.

Zynga stock also just happens to have broken above its high of [NINE YEARS.](https://imgur.com/a/6tPWzF1)

Earnings are this Wednesday, Feb 10, after the bell, and it also presents at two conferences on Feb 11th and March 3. 

Zynga is a sleeper, but it won't be for long.

Discovery holds a bunch of networks women love to watch, like HG TV, Food Network, house flipping and all that. Recently they created their own streaming service (why not) and stock has responded nicely. $DISCA is up 95% in past 3 months. A portion of this is said to be due to short covering among funds (more on that later) but I disagree. GME squeeze has not picked up until mid January, Disca has been ripping since mid November.

Among all free apps in Apple universe, it has been moving between 50th and 100th place for the past couple weeks in downloads, and have been on top 10 rankings for android for a while. 

Trading at a 20 P/E and 7x FCF compared to its competitors you could say its relatively cheap. 

Now here are the catalysts, Michael Bury owns 500k shares of this beauty. I'm sure he did more DD than me, so betting on big fella to find value for me. 
It is the most shorted stock in SP500 and trades at a 50% valuation discount.
Discovery+ went live early January and earnings report is due March 1st, I expect even if they announce mediocre numbers, stock should pick up pace due to low valuation.

As you all are aware, growth expectation is everything in this market. Down is up, up is up, everything makes money.

I'm not a financial advisor, I am not telling you to buy the stonk, I just like the stonk myself. Couldnt care less what y'all decide to do. 

As of the day of this post I‚Äôm long 1/2022 $60 and $70 calls, also $47.5 3/19/2021 calls and planning to hold until mid year at least.

Edit 2: Someone let me know that I had made a clerical error, 99 billion should have been 9.9 billion

Hello, I have been a lurker of the sub for just over 2 years, this is my first DD so please don't hold back and let me know what my blind spots are.

AMC is currently trading at 6.83 when im writing this and I see it possibly going a little lower but I do believe that ~ 7$ is a good price for this stock considering the rebound it could make in the coming months/years.

AMC and theaters in general are a very important part of American culture, or at least have been for a long time, covid could change all of this I am aware; however I do not believe that hollywood is willing to give up a 9.9 Billion dollar a year industry because someone ate batman. In 2019 theaters generated an estimated revenue of 9.9B this number fell harshly and predictibly due to Covid laws, but their alternative was something no one even considered trying. Paying $30 to watch a movie via a streaming platform... This is something I think even idiots look at and think ""wow this is a rip"", and there is no alternative to this as movie studios simply cannot rely on subscription revenue to create a movie that can survive by todays standards.

One of the major things about theaters that draws people in is the sheer quality of the tech, where as we could spend 10 or 20 thousand on a tv and sound system, these theaters spend that per speaker, for an uncompromised experiance unobtainable at home without cutting edge and expensive technology that is by no means ""popular"" or ""accessible"".

My personal opinion is that AMC will probably climb past the 10$ mark when they can resume normal operation, me and all of my friends have been talking about theaters and how they are in a ""make-it-or-break-it"" scenario, this is probably my biggest worry in terms of this stock, there is a VERY real chance that people will simply not care about theaters after all this is over, but I am counting on Hollywood to not let that happen, I believe they would fight tooth, nail, and every apendage they had to keep theaters in America.

ACTUAL DD:

Old Financials: Prior to COVID-19, AMC had found itself in a small rut of sorts, their overall revenue was only up .19%, they were spending much more on advertisements than usual and they were also dealing with a lower than average operating income (down 48.68% 2018-2019) and they finished out the year in debt, they had lost 149.10M

New Financials: 2020 has been an absolute shit show for AMC, they are down across the board by > 90%, and their last reported operating income in september was -675.40M and the finished the year out 905.80M in the red. Q1 2020 obviously had lessened effects on the company as the US was undecided for a while on how seriously we were going to take it.
Their Gross profits have also fallen:
Q4 (2019): +939.60M - (+3.15%)
Q1 (2020): +616.40M - (-20.32%)
Q2 (2020): +14.20M - (-98.75%)
Q3 (2020): +84.10M - (-89.90%)
It is also worth mentioning their net income across the quarters has went from -149.10M in Q4 2019 to -3.64B Q3 2020

OPINION: I think that AMC is currently in a dangerous predicament in terms of hemmoraging money each quarter, however I do believe that Hollywood has enough of a vested interest to turn this into a possibly money maker. No one is calling for theaters to go away, people like them and they enjoy the atmosphere that comes with the experiance, we love the memes of a 20$ popcorn and a 50$ soda, but I really believe Americans like the cinema.

Position: 20 Jan 23 3.5$ call I belive in AMC long-term (at least for the next few years), I am very much so considering a LEAPs position on AMC, I wouldn't be mad being stuck with 100 shares of AMC, and considering the risk and reward, my breakeven is $8.50, I really believe that sometime between now and 2023 AMC will at LEAST go to 8.50, hopefully higher, but if lower than its DIAMOND HANDS INTO THE GROUND.

TLDR: AMC has issues and its a gamble, but goddamnit I like it

The sub is divided and you're creating a cult.,2963,lettza,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lettza/the_sub_is_divided_and_youre_creating_a_cult/,714,1612755875.0,"Hey guys, I've been following WSB for years now, but only recently started posting.

I'm worried that the sub is getting divided because of extremists on both sides of the whole GME saga. There's people who have never touched the stock market until 2 weeks ago getting to know a lot of new trendy terms like ""short squeeze,"" ""counterfeit shares,"" learning what a Bloomberg terminal is etc etc. Listen - that's amazing. I love seeing people get educated, especially in this community, because long-term that means loss porn for us.

What I worry about is that BECAUSE people are learning so much, so quickly, they now feel like they're the experts among their friends and are in over their heads. One one of the recent top posts was comparing the GME and AMC charts, saying how similar they were. Everyone in the comments was screaming ""MAHNEEPULASHIONNNNNN."" COULD it have been manipulation? I mean... yes... But market **correlation** is very, very common and normal. I don't think I need to explain this but for those of you who want to understand, feel free to ask. Now, I'm not saying anything about the overall movement of the stocks, as I don't know enough to tell you if it was overall manipulation, but the correlation doesn't mean shit.

PLEASE do your research before posting this shit. This is why the vets are pissed at all the GME pumping: it's in large by people who don't know what they're talking about. Not everyone who's done with GME is a Melvin bot, as much as you'd like to believe. It's all too easy to get caught up in the whole story and feel like every little thing is manipulated against you. I do hold some GME and would love to see it blow up again, but fuck guys, take what you read with a grain of salt. If you have a thesis that you believe in, you should ALWAYS know the bearish case too. Consider what the other side is saying too. You'll either feel more confident (and not need to get your confirmation bias...) or you'll realize maybe you were wrong.

The other side of the story is the OGs who have also been around for years. I see why you're pissed. The sub has changed tremendously over the last month. At the same time, I want you guys to also remember that this GME thing is turning into a cult and the more aggressively you attack these newbies the more you push them to the conspiracy side. It's not exactly the essence of WSB to teach people (lol) BUT if you just leave comments saying ""you're an idiot."" or ""you should have sold like I did retard"" you're only making the problem worse.

If you've been around long enough you know that things will probably go back to normal once we get to a bearish market again. Then we can continue losing money together in peace.

"Market inefficiencies, MOASS and you. A discussion of how the market is broken and what it means for us.",116,letq27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/letq27/market_inefficiencies_moass_and_you_a_discussion/,55,1612755581.0,"So the last 2 weeks have been interesting to say the least for the market. A basket of WAY over shorted retail stocks almost crashed the market, Rh fucked 80% of the sub, and now there is going to be Congressional and regulatory inquiries. So instead of yet another gme go brrrr post, I would rather discuss the long term implications of all this and just how broken the market is. 

There is almost assuredly regulation that will come of this. What that looks like we don't know yet. But because the PDT rule exists I am pretty sure of that. Ironically the rule that is ""meant to protect"" retail definitely cost me more money when I was starting, by trying to avoid strikes, then any crazy yolo's. 

That brings us to the first point to consider. Retail options trading. I am willing to bet large sums of money they're going to come after it. And while there is certainly an increase in retail options trading, do we really have the effect that they will claim we have? Sure it can swing smaller stocks, but its not gonna do a thing to the big boys. Remember how  short lived that was on MSFT? Mass amounts of capital that we couldn't possibly bring to market are needed for that. Softbank did it though, and that was a big dick move, especially because they are Asian and not known for packing schmeat. 

The next point to consider is what actually almost crashed the market. HF leverage. They were getting absolutely destroyed on a handful of heavily shorted stocks to the point it caused the largest alpha unwind in recent history.

[Seriously, this is how bad it was](https://preview.redd.it/34s2v7k2v3g61.jpg?width=784&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=950655debb8e699323d73684a0137961bf8e3152)

&#x200B;

It might make investors feel good to see net $0 on a balance sheet and assume there is no risk. But the reality is there is a gross $30 exposure per dollar because they are levered to the tits. This being wsb, I respect that. But it was not retail that over-levered on crowded shorts that had to unwind longs in a state of sheer panic to cover or close. 

The market did not actually crash this time though, and there is probably some decent upside in going long right now.

Maybe, just maybe its time to keep a closer eye on just how much leverage the HF's and IB's are using? These types of events are happening more often than in the past. The bankers and fund folk love to say that no ones stress tests their book for multiple sigma moves like this. Maybe they should start to because its the 5th such event in 20 years ( dot com, 2008, Volmageddon, covid crash, and now this).

MAKES WSB GREAT AGAIN WITH SOME $WKHS DD,295,letekr,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/letekr/makes_wsb_great_again_with_some_wkhs_dd/,170,1612754666.0,"Buckle up retards cuz this autist is about to take you on a ride to tendy town. Inb4 you all check my post history and bitch about all my WKHS posts, ya no fucking shit I‚Äôm gonna post about a stock I love. Inb4 Inb4 you tinfoil hat wearing GME/AMC fucks attack me, last time I checked there‚Äôs more than two stocks on the exchanges. Anyways here goes,

Workhorse group is a Loveland, Ohio EV manufacturer. 100% American Made (insert American Eagle boner gif) and completely electric for all you who value the environment or whatever. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve all come across it at some point especially when I was the top trending stock for like a week at the end of June/July. As many of you might now, this shitshow of a government we have here in the good ol‚Äô USA is looking to upgrade their self combusting USPS fleet via a NGDV (Next Generation Delivery Vehicle) bidding process for a contract to the tune of approximately 8 billion. When all is said and done, including maintenance and upkeep, the contract in the span of a decade or more is about 20b. This NGDV contract is the ‚Äúbetting‚Äù portion of this stock and despite what all the retarded naysayers claim, there is a fuck ton more to WKHS besides this contract. This is the cherry on top so I‚Äôm starting top down with this masterpiece. 

Currently, there are three remaining bids from companies involved in this NGDV selection process. Karsan (a Turkish company), Ford/Oshkosh (joint venture), and our beloved WKHS. 

Karsan - I can‚Äôt see this winning even a fraction of a percent of the contract due to it not being American. Not because it‚Äôs a bad company but if you check the requirements for the companies, they snuck in a clause that mandated 75% American made parts to be selected. Also, Biden, for the better part of his campaign and to this day has been proclaiming that he will be bringing American manufacturing to the forefront again and we will be buying American (something he and Trump miraculously had in common). For this reason, Karsan is seen as a non-factor. 

Ford/Oshkosh - The only realistic challenger to WKHS and only bear case being made against it. Undoubtedly, Ford is as American as it gets. But even more undoubtedly, they are shitty and unreliable as fuck. Millions of recalls on Ford vehicles in the past and present. Another big issue with this is that Biden was ‚Äúzero-emission‚Äù. The prototype submitted for the proposal was a hybrid and not fully EV. For this reason, I think Ford receives a portion of this contract no greater than 25%. Another reason I think they‚Äôll get only a minor stake in this is because their prototype does indeed actually fare better in rural routes where charging stations just aren‚Äôt all that practical or possible. 

The whole NGDV process has been going on for about 6 years and there‚Äôs no surprise that this inefficient government has been unable to wrap the process up at this point and then Covid took over. Yes there have been delays to the contract award as recently as October 2020. In a letter/memo addressed to the USPS Board of Governors, they were urged to not further delay this process as with the current degradation of the existing fleet, doing so would harm the project altogether and further complicate the process of removing these shitboxes that have been around since ‚Äò87. With Covid being the last excuse to delay, and the vaccine now being rolled out, I DO NOT foresee another stalling of the process. 

Another reason WKHS is my favorite in this race is that DeJoy‚Äôs current philosophy on the USPS is to cut costs and to have the entity become for cost efficient. In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, ICE vehicles are much more costly to run and maintain that a 100% EV vehicle. Fewer parts means fewer problems and much less maintenance and repair costs. Also, in their recent financial statements, the USPS had requested a 600% increase in their infrastructure spending. I don‚Äôt see too many post offices crumbling to the ground, so this can only mean they‚Äôre gearing up to install a metric fuck ton of charging stations. By going fully EV, billions will be saved over time by the post office, an entity that‚Äôs currently burning cash like it‚Äôs their fucking job. 

THE LAST DELAY IN THE NGDV SLATES THE CONTRACT TO BE AWARDED FISCAL 2021 Q2 WHICH MEANS JANUARY-MARCH 2021. 

Enough about the contract though, let‚Äôs talk other aspects. WKHS is currently partnered with UPS in testing by out their fleet and also more importantly their drone delivery capabilities. WKHS currently owns the patents to vehicle borne drone launching technology. This isn‚Äôt talked about enough. Many people think the future of this company hinges on that shitshow of a contract when in reality the really exciting part is this drone tech. It would be extremely helpful and useful in efficient package delivery especially when there‚Äôs a whole fleet management system capabilities that the company offers. As the autonomous tech and drones sector begin to grow exponentially, WKHS has a head start on it (the commercial delivery aspect). 

Institutional holdings lies at almost 50%. The big boys and big girls (BAE Cathie Wood) are in on the company and they are in heavy. My wife Cathie must be seeing something in the future of this company if she‚Äôs grown her holding to over 2.2m shares and she‚Äôs not gonna throw some money into a gamble on a fucking government contract. 

Many claim that production is an issue but this is more a scare tactic than an actual issue. Sister company Lordstown Motors (Ticker: Ride) is led by former WKHS CEO. They have offered their factory, which has the capability to pump out about 600k vehicles a year, if WKHS needs it. Important to note that WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown and will receive royalties on the first 100k Endurance EV pickup trucks that Lordstown sells. So there‚Äôs another form of revenue the company has going for it. 

It‚Äôs a growth stock with a lot of potential and it‚Äôs logistically gearing up to grow. Received 200m financing from an institutional Investor during the late summer/early fall, and it entered into an agreement with Hitachi, to be assured in the logistics of the company. Hitachi is a pretty serious company to be partnered with unless you plan on slinging out vehicles. Most recently, a 6,320 truck order came in from Pritchard which totals around 250m give or take a few bucks. This is all while IKEA a company that aims to go fully electric by 2025 is testing out a fleet of WKHS C1000 vehicles. 

Connect the fucking dots and join the ride fellow autists. I‚Äôve been long WKHS since January of 2020 and there‚Äôs plenty of room to run. High risk high reward with this growth stock but that‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all here right? 

Positions - 1000 shares, 11x $60c 2/12 (USPS BOG meeting Tuesday so these are scratch off lottos basically), 5x $60c 2/19 (see previous calls), 11x 45c 4/16. 

Let‚Äôs ride this horse to tendy town fellas ü§ù

Edit: I‚Äôm a retard blah blah blah THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE I JUST LOVE THIS STOCK  blah blah blah

EDIT 2 - WKHS vehicles are being showcased at the super bowl as Pritchard is using WKHS trucks to take people to and from the super bowl and various surrounding locations. Essentially they are marketing themselves by providing shuttle services.

Edit 3 - WKHS is currently at about 30% short sold so a contract announcement in their favor will easily rocket this to 100+ as shorts scramble to cover. It sneaky made the list of highly shorted stocks.

Edit 4 - üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ (FOR THE VISUAL LEARNING RETARDS)

Edit 5 - TLDR: WKHS is 100% American made EV Last Mile Delivery Vehicle. Has Patents pending for its drone delivery tech. Frontrunner for USPS 8.2b+ Government Fleet Contract (NGDV Contract).

"I just read the DD on WSB $GME misinformation, I still think it can moon but... $AMC üëÄ",138,let46z,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/let46z/i_just_read_the_dd_on_wsb_gme_misinformation_i/,107,1612753853.0,"So I just read the detailed posts about $GME DD and I saw a few of you join in on the discussion with a thought that‚Äôs certainly crossed my own mind more than once. The specific part of the discussion I‚Äôll highlight is *whether or not hedge funds or others in power manipulated the market by influencing the closure of trades on platforms such as Robinhood*. Like many of you, I almost immediately believed that this was a direct attack on retail to prevent any astronomical effect on $GME, but later changed my stance to the following and see that many of you share this stance too, based on your own DD: 

*the attack was never meant to prevent $GME from exploding, $GME was a distraction from the true threat, $AMC* 

Now before you downvote I will say that I still think $GME had potential to reach new heights based on my own DD, and it has nothing to do with the ‚Äú177% float‚Äù we‚Äôre not exactly sure about. However, I personally believe $AMC has more practical long term potential. It was almost certain $AMC would be going out of business, which was good news for a lot of shorts‚Äîa no-brainer, if you will. The success of the $GME squeeze scared the funds into avoiding a part 2 at all costs, $AMC surpassing ~$30 and staying there would be in direct contrast to so. many. short. positions. Now, I‚Äôm sure a lot of you (if not most of you) are more experienced, more talented, smarter traders than myself, but this remains common sense to me which is why I still maintain this opinion: at a time (covid) when theaters were ghost towns, the end wasn‚Äôt even remotely in sight, and the theater industry already in decline‚Äîwhen theaters were arguably at an all time low, imagine what might happen if the stock price was virally launched into heights unseen since A YEAR before the pandemic. Based on the simple principals of trading I was introduced to, I‚Äôm inclined to believe this would destroy many, many plans and have a historical affect on the price of an $AMC share.

Tell me if I‚Äôm wrong through, tell me I‚Äôm missing something. Tell me that $6.00 isn‚Äôt a killer deal for what might be the most undervalued stock of the year, amidst an already crazy year. Please, someone convince me not to put a... *thrilling*... amount of money on $AMC at open. I want to be wrong so you save me the time I‚Äôll spend on this subreddit and Twitter these next few months.

On the other hand though... is it $AMC‚Äôs time to shine? Why? üíé üôå",2021-02-08 03:10:53

You heard it here 1st. Redfin will be the #1 stock of 2021.

That's right, that shitty red website that your wife's bf keeps browsing while he hogs your shitty Wi-Fi (cause you can no longer afford the premium on decent internet service due to GME losses) is gonna be the gangbuster stock of 2021.

Why? As if you degenerates needed reasons but F it here we go.

1. The covid-so-work-from-home BS is going to unleash the biggest transformation in Real Estate ever seen in this country. As more people exit high priced SF, NY, Seattle, etc since their work no longer requires them to be physically there, many renters in those cities now find themselves in a position to be BUYERS in another city. That means a huge net gain of buyers as people from $3000/month RENT to $1600/month MORTAGE payment, most of them aged 25-35
2. Netflix, Tesla, Amazon should all have taught you this by now: the stocks that do well in the *medium* term are no longer the ones with the best financial metrics but the ones that are most popular among millenials and Gen Z. The ones people see on a daily basis and names get thrown around in Zoom meetings. Redfin is the Netflix of real estate due to its amazing website, customer engagement and disruptive fee schedule (who the F wants to pay 3.5% to sell their home when you can pay 1.5%? I sure don't)
3. Traffic to Redfin is skyrocketing. For those genius apes capable of interpreting a super simple graph here it is: [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/redfin.com#section_traffic) You get what means, retards? From 660 to 460s is a FKING huge jump at those levels. Now let's compare with their main ""competitor"" Zillow [https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section\_traffic](https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/zillow.com#section_traffic) See that? ZERO fking growth over the same period. Yeah Zillow site is ranked higher but that's cause boomers are still alive, the company is worth 5x more than RDFN and still has a lot of legacy crap. Do you want to invest in a company whose main growth comes from internet and sees their traffic growing ZERO over unprecedented stay at home months? I don't.
4. Valuation: can you believe the single biggest growth story of 2021 is ONLY priced at $8 billion right now?! Holy fuking shizzle, Batman! That's right. The website your wife keeps sending you home listings you can't afford after the GME losses is only worth $8 billion. That's like 2x Gamestops right now. Or 1/2 a Gamestop if you bought at $250 and still holding like a true retarded hero.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Sold a f ton of puts on  Jan 22 and used the proceeds those to buy 85, 90 and 120 calls expiring in Jan 22. Price target for 2021 is $400. Dead serious here. Or for you Papa Elon fans, $420 and funding secured.

Rocket Companies (RKT) DD - An Undervalued Gem,258,les23v,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/les23v/rocket_companies_rkt_dd_an_undervalued_gem/,168,1612750899.0,"Disclaimer: I am long RKT. This is not financial advice, and I am not receiving any compensation whatsoever from anyone for this post. I‚Äôm not a professional, I‚Äôm not even an amateur, this is a Wendy‚Äôs.

**Sources used:** RKT investor relations website and company website, RKT earnings transcripts, SEC fillings, the SEC EDGAR database, sea king al pha, whalewisdom, finbox, yahoo finance, stockcharts, openinsider, Zacks, google sheets.

**Summary**

Rocket Companies (RKT) is a fintech company that operates several brands including the flagship Rocket Mortgage. I think RKT presents an opportunity to buy serious value at a cheap price, because the market has not priced in the underlying fact that RKT is a tech company akin to Square, Paypal, etc.

* RKT has disrupted the lending industry and has embraced a fully digital ecosystem, which will continue to drive customer acquisition and retention in the future
* RKT spends considerable money and resources on UX/UI development, client experience, and marketing. This will also help drive their continued expansion into the lending market.
* The RKT ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù provides a ‚Äúfull cycle‚Äù solution for everything related to real estate transactions and insurance. They serve real estate professionals looking to generate leads, develop those leads, better serve their clients, and make every stage of real estate transactions smoother. From the client side, they similarly just make everything easier - it‚Äôs an app, it‚Äôs online, it‚Äôs doable from home and it‚Äôs not complicated. There‚Äôs an inherent advantage in what they‚Äôre doing here because closing on real estate transactions has always been something that‚Äôs complex, unpleasant, expensive, and not well understood. You need lawyers, you need agents, there‚Äôs a ton of paperwork, it sucks. RKT is changing all of that.
* RKTs balance sheet, income, and liabilities support a stock price several times higher than the current one in my opinion.
* RKT is currently stagnant in price, and the market appears to be pricing it like a traditional mortgage company, not a rapidly growing tech company (which they are).
* RKT has been around for decades (skips the startup costs that will provide barrier to entry for newer companies looking to do what they‚Äôre doing), but somehow seems to still be leading the tech charge in the industry. That‚Äôs a unique and potent combination in my opinion.
* RKT needs a catalyst to get the market to value it as a tech company instead of a lending company. Once that happens, and I expect it to sometime within the next year, RKT should approach an appropriate valuation such as 20x earnings. That‚Äôs an estimate I pulled out of nowhere, but is commensurate with the low end of P/E ratios for companies I see as similar to RKT.

**Key Point - RKT is Priced Like a Legacy Mortgage Company**

The average estimate for 2020 year end revenue is $15 billion, and the yearly earnings estimate average is $3.85 per share. 

This estimate gives a forward-looking P/E ratio of just over 5.5. The sector median is something like 8-12, which makes RKT cheaply valued relative to the earnings it produces, *even compared to the financial/mortgage sector*. What‚Äôs key here is, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs really an appropriate comparison. I would place them more in line with companies like Square (ttm P/E ratio of 325x lol), PayPal (ttm P/E ratio of 69x, nice), or Fiserv (ttm P/E ratio of 24x). I used Zacks for all of these P/E ratio lookups. 

Let‚Äôs assume RKT is conservatively worth 15x earnings, and that it hits the estimate of $3.85 eps. **That would put its fair value** ***right now*** **at $57.75 per share.** I think it‚Äôs worth more than that but, we all should do well to remember that it‚Äôs really only worth whatever the market will pay for it. 

**Key Point - Catalysts**

This thing needs a catalyst. Right now I am loading up. I‚Äôm buying shares, I‚Äôm selling SHORT TERM covered calls to reduce basis on those shares, but I will be stopping the sale of those covered calls within a couple weeks most likely. The Q4 earnings announcement will be on 2/25. I am not sure that the actual earnings numbers will be enough to wake this thing up, although I expect them to be good. But if that announcement comes with discussion of their focus for 2021 and beyond, and gets the market thinking about them as a tech company first and mortgage lending company second, things will start to heat up. I don‚Äôt know when the real catalyst will hit that triggers the run-up, but I think it could start with the Q4 earnings call. I am looking at $21 as the floor for this stock, and I expect the price to double within a year. I will be acquiring OTM LEAPs, expiring next spring.

Supporting information and background follows.

**The Business**

RKT is in the business of providing solutions to financial transactions, including mortgage origination and refinancing, auto lending, and more. Specific subsidiaries and my simplistic view of how they interact:

*Home Financing*

* Rocket Mortgage - The mortgage company. This is a prominent ‚Äúpublic facing‚Äù part of the Rocket ecosystem.
* Amrock - Amrock provides title insurance, property valuations, and other solutions. I see this as ‚Äúsupporting infrastructure‚Äù to keep clients within the rocket ecosystem where they would otherwise need to go elsewhere and is part of what makes RKT a one-stop-shop. 
* Amrock Title Insurance (ATI) Company - basically does underwriting for Amrock. The ‚Äúbusiness end‚Äù in my simple understanding of the world. 
* Nexsys - provides a streamlined approach to the closing process with their Clear Sign and Clear HOI technologies - taking care of closing day authentications and sharing of homeowners insurance information.
* Lendesk - Lendesk specifically provides solutions for the mortgage market in Canada
* Edison Financial - Basically the ‚Äúfront end‚Äù of Lendesk that Canadian clients would interact with.

*Home Sale and Search*

* Rocket Homes - Rocket Homes is a proprietary home search platform and real estate agent referral network. Basically this matches buyers, sellers, and agents, and is a key aspect of keeping clients completely working within RKT for all aspects of real estate buying/selling/financing.
* For Sale By Owner - A digital marketplace designed to let clients buy and sell real estate on their own. I think it‚Äôs absolutely brilliant that RKT owns this, but more on that later.

*Auto & Personal Financing*

* Rocket Auto - Supports rental and online car purchasing platforms.
* Rocket Loans - online personal loan solutions for clients.

*Media*

* Core Digital Media - a major advertiser in the mortgage, financial, insurance, and education sectors.
* Lower My Bills - this company is basically a ‚Äúportal‚Äù business model that connects people with providers of various loan and insurance products.

*Services & Technology Development*

* Rock Connections - Basically a sales and support platform that handles appointments, prequalifications, generating leads, and data analysis among other things.
* Rock Central - I will generalize this as ‚Äúbusiness support‚Äù. HR, administration, etc.
* Rocket Innovation Studio - A tech incubator to gather and engage top talent and ideas.

**Recent Acquisitions**

RKT, through Lendesk, acquired Finmo back in October of 2020 ([https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce\_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce\_referrer\_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA\_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT\_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rocket-companies-subsidiary-acquires-fast-182042594.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALnvnNBoglSnmMP0O61AqgXBJokNS53LjJYuG3NvYKhayp4I6ZH2RpfmFUbSsCAU4xmnBNGMTwiEG-Ly29EabVy1-OjPIGfkYoQ3389gn3Edebs9sIwWOy1tPzqjRwOwwGA_PWg0cNzEFCe7HBTilMwADUT_y0QxWw8vizWecGcv)) Finmo is a rapidly growing Canadian digital mortgage platform and this acquisition I think was perfect - it shows RKTs dedication to embracing a fully digital experience, and making sure they‚Äôre the ones leading that charge.

**Management**

I do not have much to say here, aside from this. The RKT team is not the new kids on the block, they have decades of industry experience. Also, I value leaders that make people feel valued. And on that note, under CEO Jay Farner Quicken Loans has been in the top 30 of Fortune‚Äôs ‚Äú100 Best Companies to Work For‚Äù list for 17 consecutive years.

**Financials and Growth**

When it comes to the numbers, RKT is killing it. I don‚Äôt want to just spout a bunch of numbers that anyone can easily go look up so here‚Äôs a couple that stood out to me from the Q3 earnings announcement and related data:

$4.63 billion in revenue, which is 163% YoY growth. 

From that revenue, they beat EPS estimates with $1.21 for the quarter vs $1.09 expected. 

Net income was $2.4 billion which represents a YoY growth of 365%.

Closed loan volume YoY growth was 122% to $89B.

Net rate lock volume was $94.7 Billion (101% growth).

RKT has brought in $13.1 billion in revenue in the first 3 quarters and seems to be on track to close out Q4 with yearly revs above $15 billion. 

That‚Äôs awesome but what I really like is that they pair this amazing growth with **$3.5B cash on hand**. That‚Äôs great because I want them to be able to scale as they grow, and make acquisitions as needed (see Finmo) to ensure they can keep that growth going without getting overextended and failing to capitalize.

RKTs ability to recapture clients is one of the keys to their future success in my uneducated opinion. Their recapture rate is 4.6x the industry average. The Q3 earnings transcript includes a statement by the CEO on how when interest rates fall, retention rate falls, refinance activity is larger. The high recapture rate RKT has serves as a natural hedge to their retention of existing clients because their recapture is so much higher than average in the industry.

Quick aside - RKT announced a $1 billion share buyback program. They‚Äôll be able to repurchase shares from time to time starting Nov10 2020, ending in two years. I don‚Äôt love the idea of share buybacks because I think this can be detrimental to actual business growth for the sake of shareholder value. However, with the large cash position RKT has (and it doubled from December 2019 to September 2020) I think this is a reasonable way to deploy some of that cash for now.

Ok so what about valuation using DCF, free cash flow analysis, something like that? Honestly I‚Äôm not convinced this is as useful as some people make it out to be. It‚Äôs nice to know what the numbers indicate, but I don‚Äôt spend a lot of time worrying about an exact price target based on anything like this. That said, you can crunch the numbers yourself or check out something like the Finbox resources:

[https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr](https://finbox.com/NYSE:RKT/models/dcf-growth-exit-5yr)

**I don‚Äôt believe that fair value estimate for an instant**, but it's a part of the puzzle to consider. Finbox has various models you can check out, but it‚Äôs also just a nice place to view aggregate data other than directly from the SEC filings.

**Product Channels**

RKTs direct-to-consumer channel is their main source of revenue right now, but I think they will be successful in their efforts to grow their partner channels as well. Why do I say that? Numbers don‚Äôt lie:

* Direct-to-consumer Q3 growth: 131% YoY ($53.5B closed loan volume)
* Partner Network growth 127% YoY ($29.6B closed volume)
   * Adjusted Revenue for Partner Network is up 502% YTD vs 2019 ( see Q3 earnings transcript)

The partner network volume is a little over half of the direct-to-consumer volume but the growth rate is just so damn juicy. That revenue growth is hellathicc.

**Current Market and outlook**

Right now, rates are low. The average 30-yr mortgage fixed rate is 2.92% ([https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/03/mortgage-refinancing-surges-but-high-home-prices-stop-buyers.html))

I cannot say how long interest rates will remain low but I believe RKT is positioned to continue to grow regardless of what rates do moving forward. They just cover so much of the space, and they do it with a focus on applied technology.

Here‚Äôs some blatant speculation. I think as we move into 2021 and the vaccine becomes more prevalent, millennials will buy, sell, and borrow against real estate with renewed intensity. I think RKT is uniquely positioned to capture that market.

Exessive Trading Volumes In Meme Stocks?,13,lerpq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lerpq1/exessive_trading_volumes_in_meme_stocks/,14,1612749962.0,"In the following CNBC article ([here the article](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-ceo-vlad-tenev-tapping-credit-lines-proactive-to-help-lift-gamestop-trading-limits.html)) RH CEO Vlad Tenev stated:  ‚ÄúWith a lot of concentrated activity in some of these stocks,\[...\]‚Äù.

In the same article the journalist writes "" Robinhood has experienced unprecedented high volume of trading"".

In the attached image I computed a comparison between NIO (which according some brokers was one of the most traded stocks recently) and GME volumes among the period that goes from the 02/Jan/20 to the 05/Feb/21.

It is very easy to notice that the spikes in volumes for GME are not even remotley close to the spikes in NIO. On the period I considered the maximun daily volume for GME, which occures on the 22/Jan/21, is just the 45% of the NIO's maximum daily volume of 577,185,100.

Also, considerind the maximum 3-day rolling sum of volumes GME is just the 41% of the NIO's above 1 bln exchanged shares.

Computing percentage variations as LN(volumes\_d/volumes\_d-1) GME shows the maximum peak on 314% but above NIO of only 43% and not even in the hottest days of January 2021, but  around October 2021.

Is it true that RH had to deal with huge volums of trading activity in GME?

$USAC is a good short and long term play,0,lern28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lern28/usac_is_a_good_short_and_long_term_play/,17,1612749761.0,"USAC is facilitates the transport and processing of natural gas and crude oil production. With the economy opening up after COVID, there's no way there won't be a surge in the need for oil. This is even more true for natural gas which is used in energy production, giving USAC a solid boost.

At present, USAC is trading below $15, where before the start of the pandemic it was trading at highs of around 18, representing about a 20% gain. The stock has had steadily increasing profit margins over the last 3 years, increasing despite the pandemic, from -96% to 5%. The stock has had its dividends increase over the past 3 years as well, and now provides a relatively stable dividend yield of 14.05% per annum.

From a technical standpoint the stock is quite strong. It has good upward momentum and has recently broken above its 20 day moving average (maroon). The ichimoku cloud is currently below the price and green (lead 1 (light green) is above lead 2(red)), and the lagging span (dark green line) is above the price, suggesting strong support for continued upward movement of the stock in the future.

I would argue that this stock is a relatively good short and long term play. It's good for playing short term recovery of the stock to pre-pandemic highs. It's also good for playing on the massive influx of energy demand once things start to return to normal, with the support of good momentum on its side. In the long run, boomers could even make decent profits from the growing dividend yield of this stock.

[http://www.usacompression.com/](http://www.usacompression.com/)

TLDR; USAC is a natural gas and energy stock currently selling 20% below pre-pandemic highs, that also offers good dividends (stable 14.05% yield). Good prospects based on increased energy consumption once the economy reopens.

Prevented ... well significantly reduced demand precluding *selling* GME at Fidelity due to Robin Hood restrictions.,52,lerft7,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lerft7/prevented_well_significantly_reduced_demand/,25,1612749206.0,"I had a limit sell order in at Fidelity on the afternoon of January 28, 2021.  (üíéüñêüèΩ hate on me if you want to, at some point we are supposed to recognize gains and then sell ... I was selling most but not all shares).

I saw GME spiking and put in a sell order far under the real-time price ... $20 below the then-current price, just to make sure the trade would happen and I could be done with it. 

That was the moment that Robin Hood restricted buying.  So even though Fidelity didn‚Äôt restrict trading, the RH incident shut down my part of the market too because suddenly demand plummeted.

Will this type of situation be considered/addressed in the hearings / class action regarding Robin Hood?

Blatant Mistakes in Almost All of WSB's DD Over the Past Week,419,leram1,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/,582,1612748787.0,"There have been quite a few posts over the past 2 weeks claiming some absurd things with very little proof. 






Almost all of these posts make huge mistakes that debunk their whole argument. It's really unfortunate to read an essay of what the OP claims is DD and then realizing that the OP didn't spend 5 minutes making sure the claims he's making make sense or are accurate. So here is my attempt to debunk the big posts. I won't be spending too much time on any one post. Usually the posts have dozens of little mistakes and addressing them all will take hours. So I'll just cover the main problem of each.  






**Number 1: ""15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i - the Illegality of Short Ladder Attacks (Legal insight)""**




>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laferl/15_usca_78i_the_illegality_of_short_ladder/





This is the biggest thread about it but any post the mentions a ""short ladder attack"", ""ladder attack"", or ""short attack"" fall into this. ""Short ladder attacks"" and ""ladder attacks"" are NOT real and are not a term you see anywhere other than WSB and a single SeekingAlpha post by a crazy person. Short attacks are real but literally everyone on WSB is using the word incorrectly. It means something completely different from how it's being used.




This is what a short attack is:







>https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2017/11/27/short-activism-the-rise-in-anonymous-online-short-attacks/











>https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp 






Just shorting a stock a lot is NOT a short attack. Actual examples of short attacks are Citron's ""research"" which scares investors into selling their stock. You can even view Bill Ackman's short of Herbalife as an attempted short attack since he was public about it which made investors fearful (temporarily). This has not occurred with GME recently. Obviously Citron was shorting it for a bit but the claims of short attacks have been much more recent than that. None of these claims talk about what was occurring weeks ago with Citron because when they say ""short attack"" they mean something completely different from the actual definition. 





Also, the trading strategy that people talk about when mentioning a ""short ladder attack"" or ""ladder attack"" does NOT even work. Think about for even a second. For this type of price manipulation to happen you need either do it to a stock with almost no volume or you need to trade enough to be responsible for almost all the volume. For the last 2 weeks the lowest daily volume for GME has been 40 million. With many days having a volume double that. So, the first possibility is out. The second possibility assumes that hedge fund are willing to trade BILLIONS of dollars of stock back and forth on a daily basis. That makes 0 sense but let's say that's true just for the argument. The goal of this supposed strategy is to artificially lower the price. Most hedge funds did not short GME and have no reason to allow this strategy to happen. If BILLIONS (or millions) of dollars of the stock are traded at artificially low then the rest of Wall Street would just buy these shares and make a profit. Thus, moving the price back to equilibrium. It is impossible to manipulate a stock price with this strategy if the volume is this big. 






**Number 2: ""GME Institutions Hold 177% of Float Why the Squeeze is not Squoze""**






>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le235t/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float_why_the/








>I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. ~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.








I've already explained what short attacks mean so this is a perfect example of a completely incorrect usage of the word.









~~Also, the site the OP linked shows shares that are available TO BE borrowed. It does not show when shared ARE borrowed. So, it actually shows the opposite of what OP thought it did. Which means his whole argument is incorrect since it depended on this to make any sense.~~





~~I go more in depth about that here:~~
~~https://ns.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/le7syu/gme_institutions_hold_177_of_float/gmaru31/~~



**EDIT #4 - 7PM: The second part of my argument is incorrect. I assumed the website worked in a way that it doesn't. I only realized this after tinkering a bunch. If you're interested in exactly why I was confused here's a link to a discussion I had which made me realize my mistake:** 



https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmixka6/






**Number 3: ""Why $GME short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not.""**







>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/







Short interest does not change when short-sellers hedge with options. Short interest is the number of shares sold short divided by the number of shares outstanding. Buying an options contract does not just change either part of that equation. Short-sellers can hedge with options and lessen/eliminate their losses from their shorts but this does not change short interest at all. The OP has a fundamental misunderstanding of finance. 











**Number 4: ""https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/""**









>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lals8v/todays_price_drop_was_100_artificial/









Again, an incorrect understanding of short attacks. The SeekingAlpha post linked is a literal conspiracy theory as is the ""CounterfeitingStock"" website. There is a reason why it the ONLY website claiming what it does and does so without any proof. We do not know the author or their background/credentials. The thousands of academics that study markets have never talked about or written a paper about ANYTHING the website or the SeekingAlpha post claim. It was given 0 attention for years until WSB found it and now posts about it every 2 seconds without ever reading the contents of it. It is the equivalent of a 9/11 or JFK conspiracy website.   








Also, the OP claims that malicious naked shorting occurred. There is 0 evidence of this. Nobody that has a background in economics or finance believes this. Just the conspiracy theorists on Reddit. Does it naked shorting occur? I'm sure to some extent it does. Does it occur on a level that has an impact on markets? Nobody has evidence of that and there are a few papers on it. Did it occur here and was it malicious? No reason to believe that it occurred on a large scale or that it was malicious. 












**Number 5: ""How There is No Mathematical Way Shorts We're Covered for Jan 13th, 22nd, or 25th with GME's 69.75 Million Outstanding""**



>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/




Of all the posts I've included this is the only one that has an OP that isn't making blatant mistakes off the bat. Not that there aren't mistakes. But, they're MUCH more forgivable than the others. 








OP's whole argument depends on the FINRA short volume numbers being correct. However, they are not and FINRA even warns for people not to use them to as a proxy for short interest. The numbers include any time a firm decides to sell its own shares so that it can fill a customer's sell order easier. This is relatively common so you can't use these numbers to show actual short positions. This is why the numbers are so off  compared to any third party estimate. I talk more about this problem here : https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ledjwa/how_there_is_no_mathematical_way_shorts_were/gmfoih1/
























**Number 6: ""GME FLOAT 177%. Apes with the Bloomberg terminal please keep us updated with the numbers.""**












>https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leby2i/gme_float_177_apes_with_the_bloomberg_terminal/










So, there's actually not anything directly wrong with the OP since it's just a post of a Bloomberg terminal. The problem is that its obvious that the OP as well as everyone commenting assumes that ""177% of float held"" means the same as ""177% short interest"". This is obviously a very weird mistake to make. It doesn't mean that short interest is 177%. It means that intuitional investors own 177% of float of GameStop. Which is something completely different. Obviously there is a reporting error because institutional investors don't actually own 177% of all outstanding shares. The reasons for this are explained here: 




>https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp#:~:text=There%20are%20instances%20where%20investors,from%20short%20selling%20between%20investors.









**Number 7: ""S3 Partner's ""S3 SI% of Float"" Metric is Total Bullshit and Here's Why""**





>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbydkz/s3_partners_s3_si_of_float_metric_is_total/








I explain why this post and posts like it about S3's data is completely in this post towards the bottom: https://ns.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5b8i/updated_short_interest_numbers_for_gamestop_gme/






Basically WSB confused the short interest calculation with S3's own short interest calculation. They have always done both and have always reported both while labeling them correctly. WSB confused the two and thought that S3 had changed the way they were calculating short interest. This never happened. They have always calculated short interest the same way. 






**Number 8: ""It is mathematically impossible that GME shorts were covered: some simple math for simple gamblers""**




>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/le4c62/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/




The original post was removed but I've seen it reposted a bunch. If I find one with the original text I'll link it. Anyway, I talk about the mistakes of this post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ldgn9a/it_is_mathematically_impossible_that_gme_shorts/gm66hgf/




**There are plenty more posts that are completely wrong or misinformed. But, I already spent 1-2 hours typing this out so I'm done for now. I'll get on later to answer any questions if any come up.**





TLDR: Almost every single post that makes claims about the markets, data, or GME do not know what they're talking about. These posts have many mistakes and don't ever have an argument that makes logical sense. Do not believe any post on WSB unless you actually did the work and researched everything an OP claims. Including me.









**EDIT #1 - 2:45 PM: Here are is a bit more info on failure-to-delivers and naked shorting:**








>https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/leram1/blatant_mistakes_in_almost_all_of_wsbs_dd_over/gmhufze/.











>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_short_selling









>A study of fails to deliver, published in the Journal of Financial Economics in 2014, found no evidence that FTDs ""caused price distortions or the failure of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis"". Researchers studied 1,492 New York Stock Exchange stocks over a 42-month period from 2005 to 2008, and found that ""greater FTDs lead to higher liquidity and pricing efficiency, and their impact is similar to our estimate of delivered short sales.""








To clarify: Naked shorting occurs and causes failure-to-delivers. However, there are many other causes. A high number of FTD's does not mean any illegal naked shorting occurred. The point I'm trying to make is that there is no reason to believe that something shady has occurred with GME in terms of abusive naked shorting.





The FTD's should be investigated just to make sure. But, I don't think a large amount of FTD's is evidence of abuse.

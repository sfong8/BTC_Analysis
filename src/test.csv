Aw shit, looks like the subconscious is starting to fight back. Vision, Agnes, Pietro. Wanda is losing her grip as she's trying to up the strength of the Hex but she can't stop the residents and Vision from regaining a bit of sentience.

Edit: Going into it more, Pietro isn't just another ""wish fulfillment"" for Wanda like Vision, or just a possible multiversal anomaly; he seems obviously more and more like Wanda's conscience talking back to her. Challenging her every decision and how wrong it all is. She needed someone she once considered her ""other half"" (twin) to talk to because she can't truly talk to anyone else in Westview about this stuff, not even Vision."

Pratar,1613118951.0,"That was my first thought too, but I wouldn't be surprised if it extends to mutants generally. Really, it just seems odd that they're doing something so important in a TV show. Maybe it'll continue into the films, where they'll introduce the mutants properly?

Edit: The reason why I think mutants are a possibility, as opposed to just Monica getting her powers, is that they chose mutated DNA as their explanation, instead of ""it's the infinity stones doing something or another"" or even ""it was magic!!!"". It's totally possible that just Monica will gain abilities from this, but it also sounds like this may lead into mutants."

Millsftw,1613119095.0,Did you watch the last episode? Lol
FGoon,1613119095.0,"It's definitely not Pietro.

Edit:

Adding my personal theory since I have some attention.

Going off of the previous episode alone, Wanda had nothing to do with Pietro showing up. He also ""remembers"" being shot to death which never happened to X-Men Peter. He can recall being shot to death but doesn't recall the circumstances of his death or who killed him?

He clearly isn't affected by Wanda's mind control, since he's very aware of what she's up to and even presses her about it. With that information, if he was from the X-Men universe and ALSO unaffected by Wanda's powers, how come he ""remembers"" growing up in Sokovia? How come he ""remembers"" events differently from Wanda? How does he not remember his own universe?

I have a feeling this ""Pietro"" is someone that knows who Wanda and Pietro are, but doesn't have the context surrounding his death and their lives growing up.

Once again, all of my info is going off of dialogue up to this episode and ignoring the title of the next Doctor Strange film, which is something everyone is hung up on.

Edit 2: Kinda weird how this Pietro says he would be Tommy and Billy's father figure and calls them ""demon spawn"", right?

Is it Mephisto pretending to be Wanda's brother to be close enough to keep an eye on *his* new ""kids"" (spawn)?"

JaredIsAmped,1613119115.0,He said last episode that he doesn't remember anything
JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613119116.0,Nah they clearly just want to hide the reveal to what she looks like until next episode instead of quickly showing her new look in the hex.

Emerald_Frost,1613119133.0,"So with Darcy's reveal that Wanda is changing people who enter the hex down to their fundamental cells... It could be another tie into the X-gene.

SherlockJones1994,1613119139.0,I think they are being more loosey goosey on keeping to a new decade each time now because this one was based in 2004/2005 era. You can tell by the movies that was playing at the theater.
JakeM917,1613119140.0,"I wasn’t thinking Monica’s aerospace engineer was gonna be anyone, but considering they have gone to meet him and he’s about their only other resource now...I’m thinking it’s gonna be someone big.

HyruleBalverine,1613119147.0,"Right? I want to add that I think that the ""Yo Magic"" snack for survivors is a clue to what's really going on."
NomadPrime,1613119147.0,"If the commercials are a way for her guilty conscience and worst traumas to leak through to her show, then maybe this particular one is where she stores her survivor's guilt. How her magic has allowed her to survive when others have died. Maybe she feels a bit unworthy of her gifts."

raisethecurtain,1613119155.0,"I don’t know if she is. I feel like with both times, she was distracted or remembered a part of her trauma and that led to her seeing their bodies like that. Pietro has been dead for years, there’s no way his body would still look like that."
TheSweatband,1613119156.0,Man watching vision get basically dusted again is painful as fuck.
GiantsRTheBest2,1613119157.0,"I believe it’s a reference to Yogurt. It’s a dairy based product humans eat. Quite sugary if you get the kid’s version, somewhat nutritious."

TheProlleyTroblem,1613119161.0,"yeah i feel like this is the only episode to not really have much forward momentum leading us into the next episode, but it is the end of ""act 2"" in a way so maybe they're just really saving some big surprises for the final 3 episodes"

The_Mysterious_L,1613119173.0,Either that or something needs to snack on Wanda's magic to survive.
MichiganMan707,1613119175.0,Lmao yeah. When did they show that was the shape of it? Guess I missed it
Worleybeard,1613119177.0,Were young Wanda and Pete dressed as Mantis and Nick Fury for Halloween?
Tityfan808,1613119177.0,It seems that way.  His dialogue also seemed suspicious.
Bravo4815,1613119178.0,"I disagree. I think it was extremely pointed: Something is feeding on or draining Wanda of her magic. We seen it the further Vision got out of town, she was starting to be drained and can no longer sustain the outer reaches and everyone freezing and glitching.

We even see Not!Pietro bringing up trauma and misery, and flashing back to dead!pietro to make her sad and making sure she sustains the world. Her giving it a good burst of power at the end probably will be what gives -it- enough power to be free."

ZebraEggs,1613119187.0,And the cinema was advertising “the incredibles” and “the parent trap”
SavageSvage,1613119187.0,"If you rewatch you can see Agnes sorta sway in the way you'd sway when trying to stand still. Everyone else was unmoving. This definitely was on purpose.

Netwinn,1613119188.0,No coincidence there.
felixfelicitous,1613119190.0,I think they bunched up the 80s/early 90s and the late 90s/early 2000s. The writing seemed like Boy Meets World at times too.

PepperMintGumboDrop,1613119192.0,I think Monica is Wanda’s subconscious gambit to beat this thing. She is causing her to change to the power that can counteract this phenomena.
ReflexImprov,1613119193.0,"Malcom in the Middle and Incredibles were both 00's though, although Parent Trap is late 90's.

Clarkmilo,1613119215.0,"I think it was 2000s. In the scene with Wanda, Pietro, and the boys right before Tommy discovers his super speed, they’re standing in front of a movie theater. The theater has a now playing sign for The Incredibles, which came out in ‘04."

Psycho697186,1613119218.0,I think it is more the fact that she can control those closer to her easier. If she went to Ellis Avenue I think that would then be more lively as an area.

TheL0neC1pher,1613119260.0,Welp I guess they really did just recast Pietro? I’m a bit confused on the bit where he heard her voice and came to her. Like I think most of us assumed that Scarlet was able to do Weekend at Bernies with Vision because she had his body on hand. How does that explain Pietro? We saw his reanimated corpse with the bullet wounds from AoU but I highly doubt his body was tucked away at that SWORD facility. Anybody got some ideas?
M3rc_Nate,1613119260.0,">**CATARACTCLASSIFIED WEAPONS INTEL**

I'm very curious what Haywards agenda is! Especially with Vision. It really seems like what he actually cares about is Wanda stealing ""his"" property and him doing whatever it takes to get ""it"" back.

The file Darcey hacked into is called Cataract which in name is connected to vision (aka our eyes provide vision and our eyes can have cataracts in them). And it's ""weapons intel"" so they're trying to weaponize some tech from Vision's corpse?"

GiantsRTheBest2,1613119263.0,Quicksilver is basically breaking the 4th wall by being us and asking the questions we’d ask if we were in it. But also going about it in a way how we would knowing how Wanda works and how to get her to stay cool about the fact you’re poking holes through her reality. Vision attempts to do the same but he’s going about it as someone who’s in universe and doesn’t know what’s going on.
JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613119264.0,Definitely... but does that mean Wanda is going to keep expanding the hex? It surely wouldn’t be just this town’s worth of mutants Would it?
Gunpla00,1613119264.0,Kinda disappointed but who knows what’s going to happen
RiskyForeverNM,1613119268.0,"she was clearly moving and talking, just pretending to be frozen, i would say she’s just playing along"
7ejk,1613119268.0,It makes sense with what happened to vision as well. It might be impossible for him to survive outside of the hex. That’s why his body was deteriorating
Nothinkonlygrow,1613119268.0,"I’m kinda waiting for vision to mention somethings wrong and for pietro to just say “maybe we should get some help, maybe we can call in the X-Men?” And just have everyone else be confused as to what that is"
Synth-Pro,1613119270.0,"So are we making Photon a Mutant?

She's been seemingly powerless so far, and then they drop the bomb that being in the hex literally changed her DNA. Soooo... is everyone inside essentially being turned into Mutants now? And does that mean Darcy is now getting powers (especially since Kat Dennings recently revealed she has more Marvel/Darcy appearances lined up after this show)?"
douche-baggins,1613119270.0,"What, you didn't see that coming?"
happymeal98,1613119272.0,"But who is Monica's ticket back into Westview?

I thought that'd be this week's twist ending. But I'll take Wanda grief leveling up again HOLY SHIT."
anttoekneeoh,1613119272.0,Following the timeline it isn’t. It’s just something Wanda added to make vision whole again. Technically that stone was destroyed by Thanos
drewsapro,1613119272.0,I just want that Reed Richards reveal
bitbee,1613119273.0,"huh, so pietro knows that vision died..."
Firespray,1613119274.0,"They seem to have retconned some of her skill set, didn’t she start out as a Political Science major?😂"
IamFulcrum,1613119274.0,These last 3 episodes better be fucking hour length let me tell you. Over this half hour format every week.
watterpotson,1613119274.0,"I wonder if Vision will remember the conversation with Wanda, and how he was almost torn apart trying to leave the Hex.

I have to guess yes (based on him remembering everything else that's happened in the Hex so far), but he was pretty messed up by the time the Hex expanded back over him."
nerdymen242424,1613119274.0,Reminded me of Cyberpunk NPCs lol. Wanda cut corners and got lazy towards the edges IMO 😂

Predictist,1613119277.0,Monica's DNA was rewritten..... is this how they're introducing Mutants? Reverse House of M incoming?? wtf is happening
EpicAnimosity,1613119277.0,Fox Quicksilver in MCU has MCU quicksilver's CGI. I was thinking they would use Fox's CGI for that. Wonder if that was a direct design choice?

TheProlleyTroblem,1613119278.0,All that hacking people up in AHS Hotel probably
HorseKarate,1613119279.0,Based on that flashback to Wanda and Pietro at Halloween as kids it almost seems like someone or something is trying to implant memories in her head
MichiganMan707,1613119279.0,"He’s claiming to be her quicksilver, the one we know from AoU. I’m not so sure tho. The scene with him pressing her about how she made the hex is very suspicious"
raisethecurtain,1613119279.0,"Here, take my poor woman’s gold 🏅"
Doctor_Disco_,1613119280.0,Everyone has been mentioning that
JakeM917,1613119281.0,"So on the Quicksilver front, I found it interesting that she saw this Pietro riddled with bullet holes just as she saw Vision with his forehead crushed. So she must have somehow altered her Pietro’s body, or brought this Pietro in and literally gave him her Pietro’s life. Either way, pretty messed up."
silentnighttrain,1613119282.0,Yeah that's what they were going for. The deadbeat relative angle. But is he Fox Quicksilver or Mephisto or just a Wanda supporting role she made up
rslashrandomredditor,1613119282.0,More of a early 2000s
jordanrhys,1613119282.0,"There’s a very notable astrophysicist that has yet to appear. I’m not going to mention it in case of a spoiler but if it’s this person. This will be big.

Edit: sorry, it’s an aerospace engineer"
ThexanI,1613119282.0,Just me that finds it a bit annoying that they are again doing the bad governmental character with Hayward like Ross and Pierce? I'm honestly more on Haywards side than Monica and co.. Wanda is holding 4k people prisoner.
eddieswiss,1613119283.0,Man I dunno what to think! Is Evan Peters Pietro or Mephisto?!
jbroy15,1613119284.0,"Could be one of those where it happens, but then it ""officially"" happens in the Strange movie."

Flabnoodles,1613119290.0,"Holy cow this episode (this show, really).

Vision getting quasi-dusted

Pietro corpse-scare

DARCY NO

Very interested to see what Vision is like next episode. Will he remember this, and begrudgingly have to go alone with Wanda's charade?

Agnes' ""shift"" when Vision touched her didn't seem the same somehow. Almost like she faked it? But I could very well just be going off what everyone has mentioned before about her being involved.

Pietro is definitely not a friendly face.

Who is the contact?"
j0llypenguins,1613119290.0,but The Incredibles came out in 2004....
currentwavypearl,1613119293.0,thanks!
thatsyurblood,1613119293.0,"Right, or just life in general"
EXACTLY_RIGHT,1613119293.0,I think it was that but also a hint that her magic doesn't bring people back to life really
darklink12,1613119294.0,"So are we finally done with the ""Agnes is behind it all"" theories now or do we think she's just faking her confusion?"
TheDenaryLady,1613119295.0,"Nah, it's just an upside-down WOW!

Edit: Turns out that is a real tattoo that Evan Peters has!"
DrunkByDesign,1613119296.0,"Well yes, but actually no."
RiskyForeverNM,1613119296.0,weakest???? closer to best
KlaysToaster,1613119296.0,I thought it was the opposite. Magic was what killed him
Myfourcats1,1613119297.0,But why does this Pietro remember being shot? Is he from the FoxXmen universe or is he from amother universe where something similar to Sokovia played out?
far219,1613119297.0,Lmao. I never did like yogurt much.
SweetFlower2764,1613119298.0,that’s probably why this episode ends abruptly and we move into the final parts that’ll def feel like a movie  finish
LaboratoryManiac,1613119300.0,Meanwhile the sitcom soundtrack just keeps playing...
EVLEWT,1613119300.0,"My gut say it's an Infinity War trauma reference. Magic didn't stop her from being snapped/""dying""

Or it's that her magic can't stop being from dying/bringing them to life."
TheSweatband,1613119301.0,HOLY SHIT WANDA CHILL
YonahN,1613119302.0,Bro has died like 4 times 😂
anonamus7,1613119303.0,"Thinking it will be the reason for the tank invasion, he’ll say wanda absorbed everyone else and justify sending in all those forces we saw in the teaser."
DSDantas,1613119304.0,"AKAIK the ""guy"" is probably a woman, since on this and the last episode Monica refers on the Brazilian and Spanish voices as a woman"
JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613119304.0,"Yes I think for sure with Monica. They’re clearly talking about the rewriting the cells for super power reasons, not “getting cancer” reasons."
ImjustANewSneaker,1613119304.0,That would make sense. Imagine she tries to fix two problems in one. Plus Monica saying Wanda is the solution too.
boatboy1800,1613119306.0,"Interesting that in theatres, the Incredibles, a movie from 2004 is coming out at the same time as The Parent Trap, a movie from 1998. Maybe those were just special movies for her as a child?"
CaptainWitten82,1613119307.0,What’s interesting too is what about all the other people who just got sucked in? Like Darcy? Is she getting powers now?
btmvideos37,1613119307.0,"This episode wasn’t as “shocking” but still really good. Did what they were trying to do really well. The Malcolm in the Middle stuff was awesome. We didn’t get too many answers about Evan Peters,  her we still have 3 episodes left. Vision going to the edge of town and that scene with Agnes are so eerie. Vision desperately trying to leave westview was heartbreaking. And her seeing dead peitro seems to imply that whenever she starts acknowledging the fakeness of her reality, she can’t hold it together. They reinforce the idea that she doesn’t know how this started but she DEFINITELY has control. Main it was so awesome to see her freeze everything and then EXPAND westview. Super interested to see Darcy in westview and see the person Monica is meeting (hopefully Reed Richards, fingers crossed).
Pietro is definitely sketchy. I’m hoping they do the multiverse thing, but idk. He seems to know too much about the mcu. His stories don’t match with the fox universe. BUT they do mention multiple times that he looks different and his memories don’t line up with wanda’s either. So I have a feeling he has false memories implanted or something. They also made a kick-ass reference (a movie both Evan peters and Arron Taylor Johnson were in). I have faith in marvel and I know fans (including myself) will be mad if pietro only looks different due to someone creating a “new” pietro, so I have faith that they’re gonna go the multiverse route. We just don’t know what they have planned. This episode definitely sets up the scope of the final three. 
I don’t think it was as good as last episode but it’s definitely a contender for number 2, and it makes me hyped for episode 7"
HyruleBalverine,1613119307.0,"I think it might be a clue to what's going on behind the scenes.  Eating ""Yo Magic"" and ""Yo Magic"" is food for survivors..."
everadvancing,1613119308.0,Agnes is definitely in on it somehow.
crumpy24,1613119309.0,"While I’d love Fassbender as magneto, I think we’re going to get some version of Professor X"

ElitePlanet,1613119310.0,Ok so we can definitely confirm agnas is Agatha Harkness. Not that we had any doubt but this confirms it.
ReadTheFish,1613119310.0,His memories were rather fuzzy
ShawsyishUK,1613119311.0,"So, Rambeau's contact is Mister Fantastic, right? I sincerely can't think of a big returning character that would warrant so much mystery so it has to be a major introduction.  I'd be shocked if it's someone we've already met. Plus, we know they're introducing the Fantastic Four, and Reed Richards is one of (if not the) smartest people in the universe."
Prozo777,1613119311.0,I think she is Woo's missing person in witness protection
ZellNorth,1613119315.0,Agnes doesn’t seem like reliable info tho!
FGoon,1613119317.0,Vision died. This is just a reanimated corpse.
samdaman94,1613119318.0,This show is amazing

NomadPrime,1613119324.0,"I'd imagine the residents are in a living nightmare. Absolutely no control of your actions. Just vague awareness. Like being stuck in a coma with some sensory awareness.

Ginhavesouls,1613119329.0,"....... so I genuinely believe Agnes isn't the villain anymore. She definitely knows more than the rest, and she may have had a part to play in the plot. But I definitely believe she's as much of a victim as anyone else."
setanor,1613119330.0,"Not sure about the references specifically but it seemed like it was in the spirit of a lot of 90s commercials, like this candy is SO SOUR it's going to MAKE YOUR HEAD SUCK INTO ITSELF you're gonna be SO FUCKED"

Rhain1999,1613119331.0,I think that’s kinda the point of the MCU TV shows now. They’re part of the Cinematic Universe. They might not be *essential* watching but I could definitely see them being used to introduce concepts that are later used in the films.

geek_of_nature,1613119335.0,I feel like at this point I'm gonna be disappointed if it's not Reed Richards.
nerdymen242424,1613119339.0,The way he was questioning Wanda made me think he was a spy for Hayward sent in to the Hex.

WisdomOtter,1613119363.0,I was thinking that someone was trying to access Wandas magic but couldn’t for some reason and they died trying to access it. I think the other theory of it standing for Vision and how Wandas magic can’t keep him alive.
operarose,1613119367.0,I saw that!
ReflexImprov,1613119367.0,Probably. They are filming on a subdivision studio lot. The Heck house from the recent ABC show The Middle can be seen a few times (repainted). The Friends fountain is on that lot as well - Vision walked by the buildings that can be seen behind it in the opening for the last episode.

DarthDocking,1613119399.0,Detail I notice. Wanda is 100% losing control of the reality. At the theatre two movies were playing. Parent Trap (1998) and The Incredibles (2004). At the start in the 50s everything was perfect. It’s all starting to become a giant cluster fuck now

Jumbojimbomumbo,1613119415.0,"I’m still betting Agnes is more than some random civilian. No way her and Vision crossed paths in that specific spot. Seems like she egged him on to try to leave, maybe she knew Wanda would pull some crazy shit like she did?

ojosfritos,1613119425.0,this is the 2000s ep. Malcolm in the Middle (the show the ep is based on) premiered in 2000.
JamieIsReading,1613119425.0,I hate him so much
ChristianMother420,1613119427.0,Every other episode had him as “Vision” in the credits. I guess they went with “The Vision” this time because he was wearing his signature costume from the comics. I love this show’s attention to detail
twistedstarr,1613119427.0,Me too! Kids have a PA day tomorrow/today so we decided to watch it.
TheSweatband,1613119428.0,So that commercial ended up being foreshadowing for the end when Vision could no longer be sustained by Wanda’s magic as he was trying to leave
LaboratoryManiac,1613119428.0,He's definitely trying to get her to open up. Like he's undercover and trying to interrogate her.

graywing1111,1613119437.0,I don’t think so; he knows the basics of MCU quicksilver but none of the actual memories that Wanda has. Probably just got the general pietro npc knowledge to make him fit in wandas narrative but is still from a different universe
Teja-Stark,1613119439.0,Agreed. She’s showing all kinds of expressions in the show. From being scary to being scared. That shout when pietro suddenly shows up behind her was hilarious.
Jaureus,1613119439.0,Its crazy how Wanda is so powerful that Vision with his emulated mind still becomes sentient!
JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613119439.0,Hmm still 3 episodes to go and Wanda still doesn’t have a full explanation how she did this even when she’s open and honest. Could just be her powers are stronger than she though but who knows. I wouldn’t count Agnes out yet. She could just be a red herring but the focus on her throughout the show seems more than just a conduit for the audience to learn things.
operarose,1613119439.0,What if her kids going beyond the barrier makes them disappear and that's what makes her snap (like...even worse than she already has)?
ShawsyishUK,1613119439.0,"That would kinda make sense I guess, but it would be a lot of build up for a character not many people know. Reed Richards is at least known from the Fantastic Four films even if you don't have a base level knowledge of comics."

queen-of-obsession,1613119461.0,Agnes is definitely a witch. All the main characters were dressed up in their costumes. She def had to be acting to push vision away from Wanda

And there was his fourth-wall breaking (or...it wasn’t our fourth wall, but Westview’s fourth wall, so our fourth wall is the eighth wall...? He broke the ‘hexwall’. ) the only thing he ‘remembered’ was being shot, which appears to be common knowledge that even Monica knew."

Maleficent_Silver_78,1613119463.0,I think the key is what the shark says “I’m snackin on yo magic” I think someone is feeding off of wandas powers.
Rickie_B,1613119464.0,That shark in the add was talking about feeding off “yo magic” meaning that whoever is doing this is feeding off of wanda’s powers to do it?

JesusGarciaLeal,1613119464.0,"Maybe the appearance of Peter Maximoff isn't really a multiverse thing, because he has the memories of being shot down in AoU, maybe it could be the same Quicksilver but ""recast"", it doesn't necessarily mean its Peter from the Fox universe, it might just be a meta joke having him be Evan Peters."

LaboratoryManiac,1613119469.0,So of course he's one of the only ones to escape the expansion.

bradpittscockring,1613119476.0,"I think this was a mix of both.   


Very late 90's, like '98, '99, mixed with early 2000's. the Lindsay Lohan Parent Trap came out in 1998 and The Incredibles in 2004 which was playing in the theater in the one shot, and also Malcom In The Middle, which this episode was based on started in 2000. So they probably shoehorned 2 decades in one to catch it up to modern times now since we only have 3 episodes left."

ProudRavenclaw24,1613119488.0,"or possibly still under some level of control, but perhaps she's more powerful than your average joe, so she retained some consciousness even on the outskirts"
NomadPrime,1613119488.0,"As much as we all know Wanda is good person underneath, this is just crossing many lines for there not to be some greater retribution for her character. I wonder what the greater MCU plan for her narrative arc will be for all this. 

Seeing as WandaVision likely ties in the new Doc Strange movie, is she going to escalate all this until she becomes some kind of tragic villain that Doc Strange and everyone has to deal? Will she ""pay"" for all this in the end?"

UnAmaz1ng,1613119497.0,Based off my own judgment I think this Quicksilver stuff isn’t a multiverse thing? Just a nod to how another actor who portrayed him is being used in the show

So they make a point to say Monica's DNA/Cells are being re-written and odds are she gets powers from this

However it got me thinking about every other person in the town

WHAT IF... this is Marvels way of spawning in **Mutants**?

Think, people's DNA and cells are being re-written, we're all theorising that Monica gets her Photon powers from this... a town of that size now that it's ballooned might have 10k ish people, great sample size for mutants who then go on to have kids.

What if this is the reverse of ""No More Mutants"""
somegoodnikes,1613119518.0,Tbh I dont think that is pietros actual dead body because he came up without Wanda knowing and the body should be decomposed given when age of ultron takes place
jacob_813,1613119518.0,"I was thinking that too.  I don't really see a way he could tie into this aside from maybe something having to do with all the kids potentially being asleep, or a future episode plot point.

I do overall like the series, but if I'm being real, the series still feels like a movie that isn't fully fleshed out.

It doesn't feel like a series so much as a collection of scenes that I don't know come together as well as they think they do.

Also, it's been a slow burn, and that can definitely be ok. But I'm really worried it's going to fall the same fate as DD S1 on Netflix;

If you'll recall for those that watched it, DD S1 was a slow burn too. It was mostly good, setting up interesting plot points for the end of the season, but that slow burn got too slow around mid-season. 

For whatever reasons, though, they spent so long during the year doing a slow-burn that they rushed everything in the last ep or two. I'm worried that's going to happen here where the last episode is like **MUTANTS! REED RICHARDS! SCARLET WITCH AND DOCTOR STRANGE!** and that it's going to be too much and yet not enough.

Interested in what will happen with Darcy in the Hex.

As someone pointed out to me, an astrophysicist cracked an ultra-secure SWORD firewall in seconds, lol."

b3atd0wn,1613119590.0,There’s got to be a reason for it. Like maybe her powers are being stretched so much that the details/are starting to slip and why people are just frozen.

Baebaeren,1613119595.0,I think it means that her magic can't bring back people who are dead.
DefectiveShoelace,1613119595.0,"can I just say I truly feel like this show really puts into perspective how much Vision & Paul Bettany have been wasted so far in the films

I felt more emotion in the short scene of him slowly falling apart in this episode than I did watching him die twice in infinity war, all because they actually gave him a personality and scenes where he can flesh out his character, and that's without even all of his memories and not necessarily being the ""normal"" Vision (yet at least).

I seriously hope this ends with him being alive still because it's such a shame if he's still just gone when he finally got the chance to do stuff"
WallStapless,1613119595.0,I like how Quicksilver is aware when Billy (Tommy?) is talking to the camera in the beginning
MastaAwesome,1613119599.0,"The in-hex ""canon"" reason for that question was that he wanted to know if she needed him to change a tire or a lightbulb or something in her husband's absence. It's not necessarily an indication that he's really aware, though I'd say that there have been several hints that all of them are only subconsciously aware of what's going on. Other than Agnes, who suspiciously seems to be acting like she doesn't know what's going on, yet even at the edge of the hex she's not frozen in place..."

WontonJr,1613119606.0,"Well it’s definitely not Strange or Coulson as her contact is “an aerospace engineer,” so it’s very likely that it’ll be a new character (Reed?) with a role to play in the MCU going forward."
PepperMintGumboDrop,1613119606.0,Pietro is being dodgy. He is not the real Pietro. Wanda’s subconsciousness is trying to tell her that both Vision and Pietro are dead. That is not Pietro’s real body.

Porknelius,1613119611.0,"Interesting. So now, a majority of SWORD is within the Hex, so Wanda has no threat. But in the trailer, we hear and see Wanda and Vision say something along the lines of ""let's fight for our home"". What could that threat be then?"

ThisIsFriday,1613119624.0,"He called the twins demon spawn and told them to unleash hell. In the comics their souls are literally part of Mephisto, which, in a way, makes them “demon spawn”. That doesn’t mean Mephisto will for sure play a part though, it could just be a cheeky reference."

6Suicidal_Sloth6,1613119626.0,"Theory

The hex will cover the whole world by the end. Nightmare was the catalyst and why this series ties into doctor strange. 

The hex rewrites DNA, but it won’t manifest as powers in everybody. However, because the hex eventually covers the whole world, that’s why mutants begin popping up"
bobinski_circus,1613119628.0,"I know that the show wants to convince me he’s a villain...but I think he makes a lot of good points and points out harsh things that the ‘heroic’ characters are trying to avoid. Monica is making reckless decisions and is putting her empathy for Wanda ahead of good military strategy and behaviour and the lives of others threatened. She is way out of line and Hayward had every right to throw all three of them out. She was given more than her fair share of leeway and, tbh, after being in the anomaly probably should have been kept under observation instead of reinstated.

Going for her mother is low, but Monica and crew made it personal first. They called Hayworth a coward, and he made a good point about her just getting back and skipping over a lot of traumatic shit that he had to live and fight through.

I simply can’t think poorly of Hayworth the way the show wants me too."
EVLEWT,1613119631.0,I think we find out next episode when they go to pick up the rig to enter into Westview.
TheL0neC1pher,1613119632.0,I’m kinda liking the idea that Pietro is just Nightmare screwing with Wanda

gman5923,1613119638.0,"so I just had a really disturbing idea for what the yogurt ad could represent. what if it's meant to symbolize the people under Wanda's spell who are operating on ""low battery power"" and don't seem to be able to move or do much of anything.

this would create the issue of them not being able to eat, drink, or perform any basic bodily functions. if left for long enough they could start to waste away due to starvation or dehydration. but as we've seen with vision in this episode, she's able to keep people alive indefinitely as long as they're in her sphere of influence.

basically, I think the kid in the yogurt ad is meant to represent the residents of westview slowly starving to death while wanda keeps them alive in a constant state of agony to use as puppets in her dollhouse. this is probably too depressing to be the real answer but it's the first thing I thought of when seeing the ad lol"
Wendigo15,1613119640.0,Who else would be capable?
iasserteddominanceta,1613119640.0,"This might be how they do mutants but there’s also been some talk of rebooting Inhumans after the fiasco that was the TV show. This could be a backdoor for Inhumans. 

Also, I find it fascinating that they set this show in Jersey and that they expanded the hex this episode. You know who else lives in Jersey? Kamala Khan AKA Ms. Marvel. I wouldn’t be surprised if they changed Ms. Marvel’s origin story a bit to feed into what’s happening in WandaVision."
HopBender,1613119641.0,Three more for good measure.
mateogg,1613119642.0,"I really hope he makes it out of the Hex. He has a good chance, I think, considering there's a younger generation of superheroes incoming.

Tommy on the other hand has less of a chance, speedsters can be a problem and from what I remember he didn't last long I'm the comics. Unless he returned?"
Jordanmc2,1613119644.0,In the House of M comics she basically does that to the whole universe and in one of the tie-in comics it starts to collapse the multiverse.

In Infinity War, Vision and half of the universe died but she survived."
hodge91,1613119661.0,Monica said he though didn't she? I was thinking Riri originally but don't think so now. Its either someone whose skilled up since they've been in the MCU (ie Harley from IM3) or someone big to be established

Nothinkonlygrow,1613119663.0,"Most likely wanda’s doing, she has to convince herself it’s pietro.

At the same time she’s also confused, like even she doesn’t know how he’s there, and he doesn’t seem to remember anything other than how pietro of this universe died.

My theory is that somehow Wanda or mephisto brought Pietro in from the X-men universe, being in the hex forced wandas memory of his death into him, he’s asking her questions and acting impressed to try and figure out a way to break the hex and escape to find the X-men or something.

At the end of the episode he almost seems to intentionally upset her, once he realized vision escaped he probably tried to make her even more unstable to possibly get her to break the hex."
bradpittscockring,1613119665.0,Same. I feel like the Mind Stone can easily explain awaking the mutant gene in people and there's been promos of Wanda looking at it and it turning into this huge burst of light.
btmvideos37,1613119666.0,This is a 2000s episode. They seemed to have skipped the 90s or maybe last epsode was a combo of 80s and 90s. I know it’s 2000s because the intro was clearly Malcolm in the Middle which aired from 2000-2007

NomadPrime,1613119669.0,"He is like, the worst kind of ""good"" character. Where he's supposedly on the heroes' side but we know he is straight up an obstacle for the obvious solution. I mean, I get where he's coming from, as an average civilian in the MCU. And his antagonism does give a chance for our characters to develop and think outside the box, but fuck...there's like a limit, yknow? Like I almost wish he gets taken out by Wanda lmao."
MartianSunsets,1613119673.0,New theory. Hayward and SWORD were using Vision’s corpse to build a new weapon—Grim Reaper. One that can protect the world with ruthless efficiency so that something like the Snap never happens again. They want Vision back so they can continue their work.

BasicallyMogar,1613119674.0,"Oh definitely, I don't think she's making most of these decisions consciously. There's something at play here, and if Marvel doesn't explain her power boost with something (*cough* Mephisto) I'll be disappointed. But I think she *is* subconsciously running things. Judging by how the episode ended she has the juice for it. And that was probably why the kids were kept out of it until now."
ThanosIsDoomfist,1613119675.0,Yes lol
D_Beats,1613119677.0,"Well he says in the episode he got shot up in the street one minute and heard her calling the next

EXACTLY_RIGHT,1613119684.0,Lamo trueee

Rockstar408,1613119749.0,"Another great episode! But a weeks wait for 30 minutes is really testing my patience.

- Tyler Hayward obviously up to something

- wtf was that ad?

- Vision doesn’t know who the Avengers are!

- Vision knows that he died?

- Seeing Vision fall apart after leaving the Hex was heartbreaking, then he was fine after returning to the Hex.

- Wanda even knows Pietro doesn’t look the same.

- It seems like Vision was morphing back into his corpse body that was spread across the table when Wanda stole him.

- That scene of Evan Peters looking like Pietros corpse was so creepy.

- It looked like “Pietro” was intentionally trying to make Wanda mad then she attacked him. I think she’s going to realise that it’s not actually Pietro and that he’s probably behind all of this.

- Evan Peters definitely isn’t Pietro. He knows way to much. He has to be the higher power here right?

- Tommy and Billy have their powers!!

- Guess we’ll see Darcy as a resident now!

- WHO ARE THEY MEETING???? REED RICHARDS???? DR STRANGE???

SuperiorStudios,1613119795.0,"WHAT AN INSANE ENDING!

I can't say that I wasn't disappointed that this wasn't a Full House episode, however, they completely nailed Malcolm in the Middle.

At first, I thought Agnes was playing a victim just to trick Vision, but I now think she really is another hostage. It might all be Wanda. I'm so down if that's the case.

I have absolutely no idea what to think about Quicksilver. I mean, he could still be from the X-Men universe, but why does he know very crucial information about this one? Also, they showed him with the bullet holes. Is Evan Peters really just playing an in-universe recast of Pietro? Very interesting...

With the way Director Hayward is acting, I'm thinking he's a skrull and they're setting up Secret Invasion.

Is Captain Marvel going to be the big cameo people are talking about? The show is referencing her a lot. It seems like they're doing it too much to only set up Captain Marvel 2.

GiantsRTheBest2,1613119801.0,I was hoping for a classic Marvel moment where a character notices a scene is playing out too much like how it does in cliche movies so they call it out somewhat breaking the 4th wall. I get that the comedic relief should be in Wanda’s world and not in the camp it should be the drama. But tell me this scene wouldn’t have finished perfectly If right before Agent Monica says “Wow what good guy has ever said that speech in a room full of people before? Raise your hand if anyone else here is getting kinda getting shady vibes from the director” that’s when Agent Woo and Darcy raise their hands and awkward silence falls upon the scene as we realize it’s only them three that raised their hands.

DCT_X95,1613119892.0,"The Incredibles being on the cinema marque was out of place, I assume for a reason. The episode was 90s themed. The Parent Trap was released in ‘98. The Incredibles was released in ‘04.

EDIT: oh my god is it because the kids in The Incredibles have the same powers as Wanda’s twins? And the twins are/will be doing the same thing that Lindsay Lohan did in The Parent Trap?"

22deepfriedpickles22,1613119894.0,This is my favourite episode so far. So much happened and the humor was great.
weebgamer69_,1613119894.0,I wonder who Monica and jimmy where going to meet ..
Samantha_Cruz,1613119894.0,That means they finally revealed that nick fury is frozone. Now we need them to acknowledge mace windu!!!
KimF29,1613119896.0,"Yeah that was suspicious. Billy was talking, Tommy carried on playing the game. But ‘Pietro’ seemingly can break the rules of the sitcom"
RSherlockHolmes,1613119896.0,"This is how I took it too. He made a reference to their costumes as kids and she says, ""that's not quite how I remember it."" Then he made the accurate comment of how OG Pietro died (which would be something easy to know) but didn't answer the question about the boy in the orphanage (he deflected) and deflected about his accent. 


I haven't watched XMen. Can anyone confirm if their personalities are the same? We know ATJ Pietro didn't act like that."

NerdDorkGeek,1613119978.0,I agree. I saw episode 5 as kind of a mix of 80’s and early 90’s shows. This was definitely a late 90’s/early 2000’s Malcom in the middle vibe.
Hellknightx,1613119980.0,"I don't think it's past trauma anymore. This ad is her current trauma, about how she's giving her family magic but they're still dead/dying."
DSDantas,1613119981.0,"Their special person is a woman. It's stated both in the Brazilian and Spanish voices, I don't think they could be wrong with both.

TheL0neC1pher,1613119981.0,That’s just it. It’s an audio description. I think we all looked too much into it. How would a blind fan tell that it’s a new Quicksilver. The easiest way to describe him would be “Pietro from the X-Men universe”.

KevinKhan3000,1613119988.0,Love how Pietro mentioned Vision died twice and thinking he can’t die again Wanda lost her shit wtf she blasted him in public without anyone noticing.
anttoekneeoh,1613119988.0,The watch commercial was the reference to the time stone if I’m not mistaken.

btmvideos37,1613119999.0,I don’t think so. I think that scene was different from visions. She seemed *genuinely* confused by how he appears. I think it’s more a hallucination. The reason it can’t be his body is because they mention time and time again that he looks different. They wouldn’t mention it 3 times if it didn’t mean something in my opinion

srstone71,1613120001.0,"I thought for a few weeks that he was Mephisto or whoever the villain ends up being, now I think I’m leaning towards he’s just your stereotypical asshole “good guy” who ends up getting killed early when shit finally goes down."
geek_of_nature,1613120004.0,"My guess is that as we get closer to present day the details are starting to blur together, as these are decades that Wanda has already lived through herself. The previous episodes had distinct differences as Wanda is basing those off of representations of those decades she's seen before, having never loved through them herself. But this one didn't as Wandas own memories of this time is starting to play a part."

Kinty,1613120068.0,"I don't think she is.  Putting together some thoughts (and things from the threads)...

1. Of everyone in the town, she's seemed the most aware from the beginning.  That implies she has some kind of significance within the Hex.
2. She was never identified by SWORD, implying she was not part of Westview before the Hex.
3. Vision found Agnes on the town border.  I think she was trying to leave town.  That implies that she's got some way to resist Wanda (""Wanda won't even let us think about it""), and that she has her own agenda.  

My theory for now: Perhaps Agnes was involved initially for her own (or someone else's, like Mephisto's) gain.  She (or someone else) was trying to manipulate Wanda, but she (they) underestimated Wanda's power of control.  And now, Agnes has realised that Wanda is too powerful to get what she (Agnes) wants?  Thus for Agnes, ""all is lost""?  And that's why she was trying to leave town?

Smiddigger,1613120070.0,How did I know some idiot would say something like that. It isn’t sexist to point out that 1 man and 2 women incapacitating 3 heavily armoured guards with their bare hands is pretty unreasonable.

Monkeychow67,1613120093.0,The episodes don't get named on Disney+ until the following week.
reavesfilm,1613120094.0,Billy got Wanda’s powers but blue. Speed and Wiccan.
woodboys23,1613120094.0,I’m not saying it’s 100% for certain the Mephisto angle. But the fact that she could talk and she was dressed as a witch (because the entire family was ALSO dressed up like their comic book counterparts) and she had the stereotypical cackle. I think she’s still Agatha and Wanda’s gotten out of control
NateLeport,1613120098.0,"Okay hear me out.

We know Wandas world has the ability to create mutants by what’s happening to Monica. Once they leave the hex they start to develop powers.

At the end when the portal starts moving it shows no signs of stopping... what if it doesn’t stop.

The hex covers the planet. Enveloping everyone on earth. Creating mutants in the MCU.

“No, more mutants.”"
btmvideos37,1613120100.0,"Personally I think this episode wasn’t a good. But not bad. Episode 5 was like a 9/10, this was an 8.5/10. I like what they set up and I was thoroughly entertained. But it’s gonna be hard to top my excitement for the Evan peters reveal as well as the fight between Wanda and vision"
Ashformation,1613120100.0,Are you okay?
ohmytodd,1613120101.0,"It’s for the pirates!

/s"
FictionFantom,1613120101.0,I found it interesting how he specifically didn’t say “I’m your brother” at the exact moment you expected him to at the town square when he’s basically interrogating her.
TNTeddyPulse,1613120101.0,Billy’s powers are more like his mom’s. But definitely not as potent.
JHawkInc,1613120102.0,"It's straight up Truman Show. The more background they are, the more meaningless their activities are. It just needs to be apparent that stuff is happening elsewhere until the spotlight moves (the couple pretending to decorate is just like the bicycle guy that keeps passing Truman's house on a loop)."
TreasonousOrange,1613120104.0,"Nope. It's a clever project name for something involving Vision, though."
john_weiss,1613120106.0,Settle down Zendaya.
hellothere0007,1613120107.0,Just saying Director Coulson> Director Hayward
devinsocoolii0,1613120109.0,I thought it was just a joke about how hard it can be to actually peel off a yogurt cover sometimes lol
Hank_Scorpio3060,1613120113.0,It sounds kind of a lazy way to introduce all the mutants
JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613120113.0,Majority of SWORD... that was there at the temporary base. Didn’t really seem like more than 100 people? SWORD is likely massive and will now send in the cavalry since Hayward escaped.
EXACTLY_RIGHT,1613120113.0,I hope so too. Wiccan will be another gay character in the MCU and I wanna see him and Hulkings relationship :)
DodgersChoke,1613120114.0,Probably Dr. Strange?
movieman994,1613120116.0,Well yes definitely but at the time I'd never have thought them to share a same universe. When I heard that there was a quicksilver in fox and another unrelated one in Marvel I'd lost all hope for them to become one.
Martel732,1613120116.0,"I am still leaning towards this tying into the multiverse. Casting the actor for another franchise's Quicksilver has to be for a reason. And Wanda is apparently going to be in ""Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness""."
iamjustlurkingrn,1613120116.0,My only explanation as to why it's Evan Peters and not ATJ is because they wanted to give Peters as much screen time as possible.
whitebandit,1613120116.0,"Monica: ""What do you mean '*you people*"""
reavesfilm,1613120117.0,Fuck. Yes.
silentnighttrain,1613120118.0,Well that's not a bad thing if the story wraps up nicely but also leads into the next few movies. I think Young Avengers fans would be wanting more than fan service with Billy and Tommy though.
AlwaysQuotesEinstein,1613120118.0,It is a real full series?
eam1188,1613120121.0,Agnes as a literal witch. Gotta be agatha.
lvlcompleted,1613120121.0,Shes gonna serve Two Broke Girls realness next episode
The_Mysterious_L,1613120122.0,I feel like it should have ended with Darcy actually saying out loud what she found on Hayward's super-duper secret file.
luketheduke45,1613120127.0,There’s still a modern family episode (I think)
bobinski_circus,1613120127.0,"He said hell, demon spawn, etc. Multiple times. I dunno, devil-linked stuff keeps popping up and witches and the devil go way back."
TheSweatband,1613120128.0,"True, I was just thinking if Wanda was in her house and needed the mailman who was on the other side of town chilling, then he’d be activated and come through."
Lizuka,1613120128.0,"Combined with her other suspicious behavior and inconsistencies in that scene compared to the people frozen around her, it feels very telling that Agnes directly named Wanda while Norm didn't. She's definitely manipulating this situation to some degree."
9rakka,1613120129.0,Anyone else saw that shady person standing menacily staring at Wanda in the background when Quicksilver was stealing all the candy/silly stringing people. He looked so damn shady idk
Albus1612,1613120132.0,Someone explain this please! Idk the significance to the comics.
mlc15,1613120133.0,So we get to see that “friend” next episode? The scientist? God I can’t wait
crumpy24,1613120134.0,Hayward’s a Dick lmao
dmun,1613120137.0,"Do we know that Wanda is feeding people or having them feed themselves when, outside of ""camera"" range, they just stop moving?

They literally can't live on ""yo magic"" Wanda!"
Kilmerval,1613120138.0,This show is so good. I always end up watching the episodes multiple times.
SnooPineapples398,1613120139.0,"Yeah, that plus he is fully aware of the situation and is openly just talking about it. 

Also I noticed he mentioned the last thing he remember is being shot, which obviously lines up, but he didn't seem to remember anything else about Pietro

Edit - this might actually be the most what the hell episode, in terms of what is even going on"
reztated209,1613120139.0,I think Herb is Mephesto. The way he asked Wanda of she wanted something changed makes it seem like he is in control.
jbahora11,1613120140.0,So is Agnes purposefully forcing Wanda to expand the Hex???
BackmarkerLife,1613120141.0,Or that Wanda is controlling everyone so well or not so well that some people are going to die from the lack of food and water.
deededback,1613120142.0,Don’t get me wrong. She’s fucking hot.
EXACTLY_RIGHT,1613120145.0,It's sooo annoying. Especially when the tab but tears off but the rest don't.
Adi_S12,1613120146.0,Wanda directly says “kick-ass” to quicksilver. Both Even Peters and Arron Johnson were in the movie “kick-ass”
GiantsRTheBest2,1613120146.0,"I eat it only because it’s great at controlling mouth odor from an empty stomach. Even if you brush your teeth and chew minty gum, you can still give out unpleasant odors from having a really empty stomach. Yougurt is really good at neutralizing it."
Hellknightx,1613120147.0,"The show has been so self-aware with all of its references and humor, that it kind of pulled me out of the moment with how convenient the hacking was."
chellxchell,1613120148.0,"Damn they referenced Kickass, the movie that Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Evan Peters co-starred in."
JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613120150.0,Wikipedia says 9 and so does IMDb. Where did you hear 8?
ReadTheFish,1613120152.0,"Maybe, he could be wherever Darcy is now. We’ll see!"
Sir_Von_Tittyfuck,1613120152.0,The one and only Happy Hogan.
ZellNorth,1613120152.0,But he has super speed??
The_Mysterious_L,1613120153.0,"Especially since the entire time, the only thing he's thinking about is getting help for the people in town."
TheSweatband,1613120153.0,She also had some awareness of the whole “show” aspect of it before anyone else did
Swerdman55,1613120153.0,What aeronautical engineers are there in the Marvel Universe? Or is that just a red herring?
capitalistrussian,1613120156.0,Minecraft hat suggests even more modern
km255,1613120157.0,Agnes looks genuinely scared there. Not sure if she's a witch or something like it was rumored.
fumblydrummer,1613120161.0,Was not expecting Jimmy Woo to hand out some whoop ass to the guards
DarkVeritas217,1613120161.0,guess someone has to get some outside help
DenverDudeXLI,1613120162.0,"How was Agnes able to speak with Vision?

The farther away from the center of town he got, the less autonomous the townspeople were, until they were finally frozen. But Agnes, at the very edge of town, could speak?

This advances the Agatha Harkness theory, I think.

Unrelated: who is the shark that gave Wanda magic, I wonder.

Continued rambling: it's like Wanda is being encouraged to use more and more magic."
steve32767,1613120164.0,this is the way
ethicalhamjimmies,1613120165.0,He said he got shot in Sokovia though?
john_weiss,1613120166.0,"It's either Reed Richards or Ben Grimm.

Has to be."
reavesfilm,1613120167.0,😎
ThiccPapaSIZZLE,1613120167.0,What about the crazy witch laugh
deleted,1613120167.0,[deleted]
overthinkingrose,1613120168.0,"I wonder if Darcy will be affected by Wanda’s magic too, or will she be an ally by helping Wanda with what she knows about Hayward?"
Muad_d1b,1613120168.0,What? He's a bit of an asshole for sure but he's taking the situation pretty seriously given a town of people is literally being kept as hostages.
EXACTLY_RIGHT,1613120172.0,Sorry ~~lamo~~
porkchopsdapplesauce,1613120173.0,The “DEAD DEAD DEAD” was alarming after last episode reacting so strongly to the kids saying Wanda can bring people back from the dead.
ChristianMother420,1613120174.0,"That line of questioning seemed really suspicious to me. I don’t want to believe the Pietro is Mephisto theory, but that scene definitely felt odd"
wchollett,1613120176.0,"Monica is Maria Rambeau's daughter. Monica and Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) had a close relationship as a result (Carol was like the cool aunt). But then Carol left for a really long time, seemingly with no explanation, basically ditching Monica. Plus Monica (and Carol) weren't there for Monica's mom's death, and Monica be bad at Carol for that, too.

We don't know all the details, but it seems like there's some abandonment"
zapheine,1613120176.0,Love the SWORD agents were turned into clowns in the Hex. Touche!
HorseKarate,1613120176.0,Yeah I was wondering that. It seems like Vision might come to accept the reality of his situation.
Shankman519,1613120178.0,Time isn’t real
Darkmoone,1613120179.0,"Called it woot!

https://old.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/l2np56/wandavision_easter_egg_megathread_season_wide/gk6mil3/"
admiralmandrake,1613120180.0,Also Hayward has a backdoor into the Hex?  Quicksilver might be a secret agent.  Remember the breach lights went off just as he knocked on Wanda's door.
Big-Red-Husker,1613120182.0,"I think all the commercials so far represent an infinity stone.  If wanda has the power to destroy them, create a alternate reality, she may be able to create a reality where they exist again"
LaboratoryManiac,1613120182.0,Watch him get sucked into the hex so we don't find out until the end of the show.
TheSweatband,1613120182.0,"Thank you, I thought it was Jarrod but knew that wasn’t it. Driving me nuts"
AmishAvenger,1613120183.0,"Hah no kidding. 

“Hey let’s just walk into this server room and hack in. Then I’ll email some super classified documents.”"
Mythoclast,1613120183.0,They would have to not only take on that role but also the specific role of whoever Monicas friend is. Reed seems infinitely more likely especially as it would begin to set up fantastic 4.
deleted,1613120184.0,[deleted]
tylernazario,1613120185.0,Darcy mentions the fact that Monica went through twice so maybe a one way trip doesn’t change you but going back out does
KevinKhan3000,1613120189.0,Wade is always handsome no matter how he looks Wanda judges way too much on looks what a fucking bitch.
harlem50,1613120189.0,"Tbh i dont think this was better than episode 5, still good tho"
GiantsRTheBest2,1613120190.0,"That she is, but I think she’s even hotter playing a milf."
nihilisticdaydreams,1613120192.0,"He doesn't act like a brother. He's not being supportive-at every moment he is making her doubt, testing her, wanting her to continue on. Plus his many references to hell and Billy thinking he is a vampire."
trostol,1613120192.0,just cause he is my fave...RHODEY!!!! lol
JamieIsReading,1613120193.0,This was my thought too
gensix,1613120193.0,Rugrats and borscht mentioned. Referencing an episode of the show?
HopBender,1613120195.0,"I could see how that would really piss people off. I doubt it would ever happen but it would be *so fucking fun* to see these big star background characters evolve into big code name X-Men of different names. I can't see Kevin Fiege allowing that to happen. But we're also at a point where it's REALLY late in the game to be introducing mutants. It's been a wild ride that's only getting better and I can't wait for all of is to see how it plays out. 

I'll bet we hear mutant by the end of this series though."
ReflexImprov,1613120196.0,"It's a Warner Bros. property actually. That's why HBO Max has it now - AT&T owns WB & HBO. 

The fountain has appeared in other productions."
sithlord50,1613120197.0,"I know the common theory is that Mephisto is possibly behind all of this but I noticed they did say ""nightmare"" two separate times in this episode. Maybe he'll be involved somehow"
LaboratoryManiac,1613120198.0,And a capital UCK.
jisforjoe,1613120199.0,"Monica's little smirks at the thought of ""her guy"" has me thinking it's [Adam Brashear](https://i.redd.it/kb9d67k5b0d61.jpg)."
thecuntessluann,1613120200.0,Did anyone notice Agnes’ velour sweatpants in the opening credits? “Naughty” was bedazzled  on them. She’s definitely hiding something.
HandBanana666,1613120200.0,He pretty admits he is not Pietro.
Lady_Alayne,1613120201.0,Why Pietro does remember the past but Vision doesn’t?
JaredIsAmped,1613120205.0,Don't think it's a reference to the past but a hint towards the series.
Gbbq83,1613120205.0,"Great shout. So we now know that it rewrites DNA and that Wanda can grow the hex when prompted. All we need is a global expansion of the hex and there you have ready made mutants. 

Nearly losing Vision is what pushed her in this episode. So would actually losing him cause that expansion."
slawnz,1613120206.0,They did this in Malcolm in the Middle all the time
SickBurnBro,1613120210.0,"It's not a Joss Whedon joint without the emotional death of an auxiliary character. Agent Coulson in Avengers 1, Quicksilver in Avengers 2, Tara in Buffy."
hussdrake,1613120212.0,"Doubt it, I’m pretty sure they don’t wanna bring up the infinity stones anymore. They need something else"

DemiurgeMCK,1613120221.0,"Well, the info we got from ""Pietro"" was pretty vague, possibly all public knowledge. And he was really evasive when Wanda tried to prod him into specific memories that only they would know...."
Neutronbomb33,1613120221.0,"Just as many fans will be upset if they tie that shit show Fox men franchise into the MCU so I don't think that's a good rationale for speculation.  I'm on the ""it's not Fox Pietro, possibly Mephisto and Evan is possibly just a meta joke for fans"" train but I don't think there was any real definitive evidence one way or another this week."
thtguyjosh,1613120222.0,100% a meeting was had where some exec said “yea but what about the people who didn’t remember what he looked like”
raisethecurtain,1613120224.0,I’m not high and the ad was scary. Good to know we had a similar experience lol

beatsbyvig,1613120247.0,"i agree with your point but honestly i just have faith in kevin feige and the team at marvel for doing this shit right. we have 3 episodes left, from what i've read they're longer, and i think the final 3 will be the 3rd act of this show and really pull together all the threads they've set up so far. i may be wrong, but i hope not"
TheRealMe99,1613120249.0,"so Hayward's last file was codenamed ""Cataracts"". as in, something adversely affecting *The Vision*?"
RealisticDelusions77,1613120249.0,I love that Elizabeth Olsen was in her costume so long instead of a quick glimpse.  Very easy on the eyes.
Predictist,1613120249.0,"This episode pretty much confirms that Agnes is Agatha Harkness for all the people who were still doubting that. Pietro was being a little weird here, before I thought that he was 100% actually Quicksilver, but after the things he said in this episode... idk. He was kinda giving off Mephisto vibes but I hope that theory isn’t true at all lol. When Vision was breaking out of the hex, I don’t know if him dying there was supposed to foreshadow how he couldn’t come back to life. But then Wanda going House of M at the end is fucking crazy like know one can really predict anything anymore after that. Who knows wtf she is going to do."
movieman994,1613120249.0,Hahahaha that thought came to my mind too because there was a pause after you people when Hayward delivered it.
CaptainObvious00Duh,1613120250.0,"Okay, but Vision died after QS, right? How does even know what happened after his death? In the previous episode, he literally asked who Vision was."
CaptainObvious00Duh,1613120251.0,That's what even I'm suspecting.
raisethecurtain,1613120251.0,I’m really excited to see what her role will be in next week’s episode
JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613120252.0,"Pietro also seemed like he was trying to figure out what was going on here... maybe it was just for the audience’s sake, but could he be Mephisto undercover? Or something like that?"

SamiMadeMeDoIt,1613120255.0,Pretty sure it stopped at the end when Wanda’s eyes went back to normal
strokekaraoke,1613120257.0,I hoped we might get to see Monica’s contact this episode but deep down I knew we’d have to wait for that.
dmun,1613120258.0,"BTW, I'm putting money on the engineer that Monica is talking about none other than....

Shuri."
ethicalhamjimmies,1613120261.0,"Yeah, brought him in for fanservice"
midnight_artist,1613120261.0,That's irrelevant at this point.
Kroftyy,1613120263.0,"But then why use Evan Peters, and not a new actor? That’s the question."
Hellknightx,1613120263.0,Kind of surprised that Wanda let Vision wander off on his own. She must've known what would happen.
TheEggRoller,1613120264.0,"How do you explain her still moving and talking while basically at the edge of the Hex though, when people closer than her to the center are frozen in place?"
ojosfritos,1613120265.0,The ep was based on Malcolm in the Middle. I meant I'd watch a full series about Wanda and her fam in that style of a show.
Agent_Hex,1613120267.0,"Well there was a reason, Fox was fighting with them about Quicksilver rights."
newey44,1613120269.0,Anyone catch the Spider-Man reference/foreshadowing ? About 22m30s in
AtmospherE117,1613120270.0,"I like 'magic can't sustain' the best. It won't be enough to keep her kids, Vision and Pietro around."
Gildabeast4,1613120270.0,Nah its too convenient that Agnes happened to be the last person before the barrier right when Vision went to investigate imo. Plus she could still talk a little even before Vision snapped her out of it when people further inside the hex were completely frozen.
deleted,1613120270.0,[deleted]
SickBurnBro,1613120272.0,Vision is the Sean Bean of the MCU.
Bartman326,1613120273.0,"But also look at Herb, he's the only other character to break the 4th wall freely. He's also dressed as Frankenstein, not sure what that points to but Vision is definitely a Frankenstein of a creation"
Smak_your_ass,1613120274.0,I really hope they stick around and aren't only a part of the Westview reality. Would kill for some young avengers (which it seems like they're setting up)
a-326,1613120275.0,i still think it's an x-men trying to find out what happend
cubeflam,1613120275.0,"So my guess is next episode Monica becomes Photon/Pulsar, the following being the multiverse completely opening, and a finale with Doctor Strange coming in to say “yo it time for my movie”"
jisforjoe,1613120277.0,It's Pietro's jorts that really topped off his Halloween look for me.
theVice,1613120281.0,I saw a Venom Halloween decoration!
TreasonousOrange,1613120283.0,">I have absolutely no idea what to think about Quicksilver. I mean, he could still be from the X-Men universe, but why does he know very crucial information about this one? Also, they showed him with the bullet holes. Is Evan Peters really just playing an in-universe recast of Pietro? Very interesting...

Riddle me this: how would Quicksilver know Vision was dead?"
Neutronbomb33,1613120284.0,It amazes me how many people try to come up with theories and completely disregard the comic histories that this show is clearly drawing on.
zapheine,1613120287.0,"This.  If you're not actually in the scene that's being broadcast, then Wanda doesn't want to (or can't) expend power controlling you."
Wendigo15,1613120288.0,I think from the original announcements.

EVLEWT,1613120361.0,"I think that Hayward line is kind of bullshit and just gives us more insight into the bullshit mentality/attitude Hayward has.

Yes living in 5 years post Snap must have been hell and dramatic just losing everyone you loved but after those 5 years people came back. It was a freaking crazy, insane miracle. 

If at the end of that, that doesn't give you reason to be optimistic, I don't know what does. I think those people just want to be angry/mad.

People went through hell for 5 years and there was a light at the end of it. That to me is a lesson in trying to being optimistic.

On the flip side, the people that got snapped. To them it's like they blinked and 5 years suddenly passed. They've lost 5 years completely of their world completely. People have died, people have moved on. People have emotionally developed for 5 years and you just blinked. It's a smaller time but it's just like Cap being a man out of time but everyone he knew was dead by the time he was unfrozen while other people, some people are gone from their lives like Monica's mom dying but then there are others still around that have completely changed."

Auntypasto,1613120370.0,"Could it be meaningful that Hayward was the one talking to Monica about not knowing what it was like for the survivors of the Snap? Kinda points in the direction that maybe Hayward IS somehow more involved than he lets on? If the theory that Hayward is Mephisto in disguise, it'd make sense."

Maybe Simon wasn’t killed by the Snap, but was put in a coma by one of the resulting accidents and Hayward wants to give him a new, indestructible body? 

The show’s central theme is grief and how people cope with it after all."
Agent_Hex,1613120380.0,"Exactly my thoughts as well. She was in the credits of Wanda's show, she gets a little extra juice to keep running. Hell I bet Agnes was so close to the edge of town and not ""popping in"" like she usually does because Wanda was spread thin keeping all the kids awake for Halloween. Gave Agnes's subconscious a chance to try and escape."

Gentlebear724,1613120381.0,Also I think because it seems like a simulated reality/virtual reality. The NPCs not having rendered until the player (main character) is near the vicinity?
JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613120382.0,"I can’t answer that but we don’t know how any of this works. Clearly Pietro knows what’s in Wanda’s mind to some degree because he says something like “I’m supposed to play the rambunctious brother, come into town, and cause you grief right? That’s what you want”. So it doesn’t seem that far fetched that he would know Vision had died before."

Prank_Owl,1613120397.0,Alexander Pierce was arguably way better at his job though.
JaredIsAmped,1613120398.0,That would actually be amazing
Jordanmc2,1613120398.0,Dr. Strange is the best bet. In theory Carol Danvers might could absorb the radiation Darcy was measuring and that might shut down the hex. They haven’t really explored energy absorption as one of Carol’s powers in the MCU but she has it in the comics. And they have name dropped her multiple times now.
Wendigo15,1613120399.0,Yeah but far from home took place 8 months after endgame. This seems to take place like a month after endgame. Strange that they didnt mention something this major. Unless it was kept secret but if mutants are a thing they would b around at that time.

TenDollarTicket,1613120410.0,Or Hank McCoy if they want to change his backstory a bit. But the aero space engineer aspect makes me think it's Richards or someone big we haven't met. You don't tease someone for two episodes without a big payoff.
AgreeableLion,1613120412.0,"Regardless of whether or not they are actually going to link him to the X-Men universe or if it's just an odd Easter Egg (or more likely some strange middle road), he's just a delightful character and I hope he sticks around to the end of the season.

TobioOkuma1,1613120414.0,Two of the most prominent LGBT characters in comics coming to life in the MCU? That's pretty big. Also there's a very high chance then that we meet Hulkling in either one of the Disney Plus shows or in Captain Marvel 2. I think that's very important

The title of doctor strange 2 which will also feature Wanda. The casting rumours of Spider-Man 3. It seems obvious. Also I feel like that reveal at the end of episode 5 was lingered on and treated as a big deal that it was Evan peters for a reason. However, if it’s revealed that it’s both the multiverse AND Mephisto, like Mephisto pulled Evan Peters version of quicksilver from the multiverse, that’d be cool"

JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613120440.0,True. But I think Pietro is part of Wanda’s mind somehow because he knows that she wanted him to come and cause her grief and what not. I don’t think this is something that’s setting anything up but I could be wrong.
MTFBinyou,1613120442.0,"Yo-magic= yam-agic 
Yam Agriculture was a Big Business in Sokovia that allowed the country to thrive.... until it didn’t. Obvious they left the r out to misdirect us into trying to make about Wanda and not another Sokovia connection.

suplexinferno,1613120456.0,"Regarding the commercial:

I can see the ""something is feeding off of Wanda's magic"" theory being true, but I had a different impression as I watched.

Was the boy on the island Wanda, alone and frightened? She described that exact feeling to Pietro in this episode. And the only way to ""survive"" that feeling was to open / unlock these magical abilities.

We see however that the kid on the island can't open the yogurt on his own.

So who or what helped Wanda?"

ThisIsFriday,1613120462.0,"A lot of us think so, but part of me also thinks it could just end up being an offscreen thing we never see. Most people are getting hyped for it to be Reed Richards, we’ll see though."
Predictist,1613120463.0,Yup me too. I still hope it’s not true as I really liked this version of Quicksilver in the fox movies and I just like the character in general. But even him calling Tommy and Billy demon spawns like.... it seems a little too obvious at this point Idk though. And then he also mentioned how Vision was already dead which the real Quicksilver would have no way of knowing.
Im_Grizzzly,1613120465.0,I bet they're meeting up with that engineer. He probably has that vehicle that they're going to try and drive thru the hex with.

laurceress,1613120504.0,"I had a theory that I am now not sure of, but would like to share for discussion nonetheless. So when Fox Pietro started asking her questions while they were alone I felt very investigative vibes from him. I put together the comment darcy made about Hayward’s plans and how she wanted to keep looking on the computer to see what he was planning. This made me believe that Hayward put pietros dead corpse in the hex to use him as a way to see how wanda made the hex to eventually dismantle it? idk it seems a bit out there, but food for thought. Or maybe wanda subconsciously put him in there because she just was talking about pietro before he appeared in episode 5"

PoopdittyPym,1613120546.0,"My thoughts too. It seemed to me
like a reference to how she got her powers."
singingballetbitch,1613120547.0,"So a few thoughts -

The ad, referencing the people who died in Strucker’s experiments. That makes sense, considering it’s the first proper Quicksilver episode. It also makes you wonder how they actually died - Clint and Erik were exposed to the Mind Stone and didn’t die or get powers, so now I’m guessing they had to get themselves food or something using the powers they gained and only Wanda and Pietro didn’t starve to death, so she’s the shark in that ad. In her mind, she let people die by not standing up to Strucker.

Billy is dressed as Wiccan, but Tommy is dressed as Quicksilver. I don’t think that bodes well for Tommy’s future in the MCU. I also think that maybe Wanda was channeling Billy’s power to expand the Hex (a bit like Ego using Quill). Billy was talking into the camera at the beginning, which makes me think he’s very self aware - possibly because his skill set matches Wanda’s.

Pietro thinks he’s the right Pietro. He has no memory of his Fox adventures, which I imagine is due to how he was brought in because it’d be a lot harder to introduce other pre-established characters who don’t have a history in the MCU.

The bits of Vision flying back into the Hex were presumably the parts Wanda created for him (the bits SWORD lost or broke when taking him apart). It’s telling that Hayward didn’t want to help him (my previous theory was that he let Wanda steal Vis, so she could fix and weaponise him before they took him back). I’m now thinking that he disagreed with the Avengers and eventually the reverse snap (all the most powerful ones blipped, except Thor and Carol, who were out of commission and offworld for most of the five years), or he gained a lot in the five years that he stands to lose now (such as being Director) and he’s taking it out on Wanda.

Agnes is also being mind controlled. That’s surprising, tbh. I’m thinking that maybe she has powers, so Wanda brought her in as a sort of guide she can turn to if need be, but she doesn’t know her well enough to let her be herself. Agnes not coming from New Jersey could explain why she hasn’t been identified yet.

I’m surprised we didn’t see Dottie and Mrs Hart. Halloween seems like the perfect opportunity for a bit of an ensemble episode, but the focus on Vision’s ‘journey’ was really good.

It was nice to see a (semi) pleasant memory of Wanda and Pietro’s childhood. 

They’ve made a big deal of only referencing the aerospace engineer as ‘Monica’s guy’ across two episodes, so I’m betting it will be Reed Richards now. 

Darcy’s in the Hex! I don’t know what she’ll remember, but I do think she’ll try to be a friend to Wanda. If the energy from the Hex is making Monica into Photon, that could be setting up a massive group of super-powered SWORD operatives. Not quite sure Wanda thought that one through."
Murdermajig,1613120548.0,"Thats very sus. If that was actually pietro, he wouldn't know who Vision is AND that he did die twice before the attempted DeHexening. Also unlike Vision, real Pietro would be just bones from the years of decay."
EVLEWT,1613120553.0,Vision is dead and is being re-animated. We don't know what the kids are exactly but because MCU is working toward Young Avengers the belief is the kids live outside the barrier.

The_Mysterious_L,1613120608.0,"Yeah the fact that ""dead Pietro"" still looked like Evan Peters suggests to me that Marvel didn't cast him as a stunt... I think ATJ simply did not sign back on and they cast Evan Peters as the next closest thing"
UrbanRenegade19,1613120608.0,My theory is that she pulled the closest thing to her brother from an adjacent reality. Which just happened to be the Quicksilver from the X-Men movies.

ThatWittyHandle,1613120651.0,"I think there’s something to be interpreted from the movies on the movie theater marquee. The Incredibles is the more obvious one as this episode focuses on an entire family with super powers. But with The Parent Trap, that movie is about twins wanting their parents to get back together by orchestrating a recreation of their first date, which alludes both to Wanda orchestrating her own reality to house Vision & her family but also with Billy helping Wanda to bring Vision back into the hex."

Pratar,1613120665.0,"This would lead to a decent introduction, I think: the mutant gene exists, but it's extremely rare, and only activated in a handful of old mutants, e.g., Professor X, Magneto, Wolverine, etc. This further mutation from the hex, whose effects at some point reach worldwide, activates the gene in a higher percentage of the population, leading to a.) a massive generation of mutants and b.) the old mutants coming out of hiding.

The multiverse explanation works, too, but if they aren't going to pull the X-Men from the multiverse, this would be straightforward and satisfying. As I've mentioned in other comments on this thread, though, it'd be weird for them to directly introduce them in an all-out reverse-House of M in a Disney+-exclusive TV show, unless Marvel's doing something like a soft launch."

EDPZ,1613120712.0,Also just realized Wanda wasn't the main character of the sitcom anymore. The show was about the kids. Could simply be because they were going for a Malcom in the Middle thing or it could mean something else.

Wendigo15,1613120733.0,They technically shared the rights at the time. They started in X-men but were mostly avengers during most of their run. Wanda was in a deleted scene in the x-men movies as well. I think u can even see her during the speech.

MastaAwesome,1613120736.0,"Then the director did a good job of misdirecting the audience with that scene, because I think it almost *confirms* that she's not a red herring. Yes, her act was convincing, but how is it that after a certain distance, everyone was just frozen in place, but Agnes - at the very edge of Wanda's control, mind you - seemed to be *pretending* like she couldn't move when Vision appeared, but was still capable of speech. That, combined with the fact that we still haven't seen anyone else (other than those temporarily woken up by Vision) directly acknowledge the sitcom premise like Agnes did last episode with her asking Wanda for a redo, is enough to convince me that she is unique amongst the residents, like Pietro, Vision, and the kids.

It's also incredibly suspicious that she was in a car at the edge of town (where Wanda would naturally never want any of the residents to go) when all the action was in the town center. I bet that in a couple of episodes, we'll get a reveal of the real reason why Agnes was there."

LaboratoryManiac,1613120743.0,"I don't think she is, I think she's just seeing things as her trauma creeps up on her.

Yes, she reanimated Vision's corpse, but she repaired him in the process, too. His repaired body isn't just an illusion she has to maintain, she changed reality with her magic to make him whole again. He appeared dead to her after the twins were born because her trauma was coming back to her after Monica mentioned Ultron."

thewaywecan,1613120753.0,"Theory: The town is all the people who's lives were ended by Wanda (accidental or otherwise). We know that's true for Vision. She might have miscarried sometime after the infinity war snap, and that explains the twins. We can stretch it and say Pietro met his demise because he followed Wanda which led to them being present on the floating city.

Pretty sure there was a bunch of people in that building she blew up in Sokovia?"

Abbx,1613120775.0,"Definitely confirmed that he can't survive outside of Westview. Guaranteed to be a huge motivator for Wanda doing all this now if that wasn't obvious earlier.

Given how we saw Pietro wounded and dead through Wanda's eyes for a second, I wonder if he's the same situation...I'm really confused about him though because he's the Evan Peters Fox X-Men Quicksilver and not ours, or that's what I kinda thought they were going for. Unsure now!"

a_o,1613120786.0,"yep. wandavision happens in new jersey a couple weeks after endgame, and far from home mostly happens in europe early the next summer. i think the class lands at the airport in new jersey after returning from london, then Peter takes MJ for a swing, then the big post credits scene outside Madison Square Garden happens. mayyyybe what happens in wandavision stays confined to within new jersey state, but if we don't get answers about what's happening and the consequences of it all in the next 3 episodes i'm sure we'll get more context in ms. marvel, spider-man 3, and doctor strange 2."

Shes using Wanda's powers for something and pinning the blame on her, unfortunately i dont trust those kids or ""brother dearest "" no more then i do Agnes.  The scope of wandas powers in thes episode.... what she did.... she should have no trouble keeping the illusion alive and well. But vision,  Agnes,  the kids (her 2 demon spawn.....  waaaaaaiiit a minute Peitro???) Are all OUT OF HER CONTROL ENTIRELY.  Agnes who is a complete  unknown quantity aside, these are all the things that should be easiest to control because they are not real,  they are physically fitments of her imagination but they are the 1st things she loses total control of."

If he was tossed out of Westview it would have been before Monica, but in episode 4 they claimed that Monica was the first person to give them intel of the inside. Did she turn him into Sparky and then make him kill himself? That's why he had no collar, why she didn't want him, and why he killed himself (after attempting to electrocute himself) when she's in control of everything. Also kind of explains why he was barking at the door about the SWORD drone."

I wonder if Billy is going to be one of the major keys to this puzzle. Billy becomes the hero Wiccan, who has the same reality warping powers that his mom has. (He actually is far more powerful than his mom when he reaches his full power). I wonder if he's going to start exerting control over the hex and changing things.

&#x200B;

Also, I wonder how they're going to integrate Billy/Tommy into the greater MCU. Are they just going to be freak kids who grew up in a sitcom? Or maybe we'll get something like the comics, where Billy/Tommy end up in other families before coming together for the young avengers. Maybe when the Hex finally blows, reality warps and the twins get inserted into families and it's just like they've always been there."
BrettTieman,1613120834.0,"Really confused by Pietro this episode. His questioning near the end is suspicious, but he also says he was shot then heard Wanda calling that he was needed. Also he does has super speed. To me, this looks like Wanda subconsciously pulled a version of Pietro from somewhere, my guess is a universe different from Fox and MCU. This would explain why his memory is slightly different at the start of the episode when Wanda says “that’s not how I remember it.” She also gave him a role as he says and “it’s what you wanted.” If this was someone in disguise, I don’t think they’d know exactly what type of role Wanda would want filled.

JimmyScramblesIsHot,1613120908.0,The twins seem to be real. The show even said this last time. The birth and everything was very real. Just all sped up because of Wandas powers.

Probably could have avoided all that by Darcy simply having some gear, she brought all her own gear anyways, she could have had a tablet already hooked into everything.

Neutronbomb33,1613121061.0,Oh I think the meta joke is just part of it.  It only works if it is also Mephisto or some other big surprise.  Also the fact that Evan is a big name that they wanted to use.  I just don't see Feige doing anything that would put the continuity he's built at risk just for shock value.  The fox men movies are all over the place and everyone knows that you don't stick your dick in crazy.   And again I argue that more people would be upset about tying the fox men movies into the MCU than would be let down that they didn't.

ihatebrooms,1613121089.0,All the cw DC shows do it too.
Astronomyinreverse,1613121092.0,"Long theory because I need to unlock my convoluted brain. I’m writing this on a phone at 4AM so it will be convoluted. 

I think Westview is actually on a cemetery, with occasional residents who live in the area. (I know part of this doesn’t make too much sense because of the IDs) Vision in explaining to Agnes she is not dead and wouldn’t know this as being untrue. He would think they are alive, which makes me suspect Wanda is animating the dead partially. I am also assuming this because of her comments to Billy and Tommy about not being able to bring people back to life, but she then admits to Piertro she doesn’t know how she’s doing all this. The commercial for Yo-magic (Your magic) also ends with the character as corpse so I think there is some meaning there. Or it’s just Wanda working through grief or both. 

I also think this is a Marvel version of House of M. The expanding area was a hexagon, which are important for some reason. It does look like the area is expanding to Eastview, that is an actual town. (Sheriff’s from episode 3?)We know that Monica is getting her powers from going into and out of the barrier which is suggested by changes to her blood cells molecular structure. The X-gene in the MCU maybe dormant in most humans. This change can then start activating the X-gene which is usually activated by puberty, great duress, or trauma. 

Then I have a running theory that someone there maybe a Hope Summers stand in and act as the beacon who then begins to activate other X-genes around the globe. Part of this theory is that the mutant community is small enough to keep concealed at this point. The timeline for certain people (Magneto, Charles, Wolverine) can not change, but a lot of other people are fair game. This could bring mutants into this universe to face their issues of them taking over the world or not. (Current context of recent comics in the past few years)"
Signal_Detective_846,1613121094.0,"Crazy theory, but what if he's Dr Strange's mole? 

Basically my reasoning is that there are 3 forces at play - Wanda herself, SWORD and whoever is manipulating her into it (Agnes/Nightmare/Mephisto/whoever the real bad guy is). Wanda obviously didn't bring him in, SWORD also didn't (they were just as surprised by the intrusion as anyone else) and given the interrogations I really don't think the bad guy is doing it either. I think that's what we're supposed to think, but why would he be asking questions that Agnes presumably already knows the answers to? Why would she need to know how Wanda did it? She had a hand in it, didn't she? Why would she need to know where the kids were kept? It's not information that's of any use to her.

Now think about it - what if Strange plucked an alternate Pietro out of the multiverse in order to send him in as a double agent? We know for a fact that technology from the decade that the sitcom is set in isn't changed, so what if the same is true for people? Nobody can enter without being changed/mindwiped by Wanda, not even Strange, but what if he can pluck a Pietro from an alternate universe's 80s? Then he wouldn't fall under Wanda's control, as he'd ""fit into"" the timeline of Westview, and he could easily get close to her and extract some information that can help Strange break the Hex. Strange probably briefed him on all the important stuff he needs to know (like who Wanda is, what her deal is and that this world's Quicksilver was shot and killed), but beyond that obviously he wouldn't know anything that isn't public knowledge, like the kids in the orphanage. He never was in an orphanage."

HawkEyeTS,1613121113.0,"I think the giveaway that it isn't Pietro is that he supposedly remembers getting shot.  Whereas we have Vision as an example of someone who was brought back who doesn't remember anything before the point that Wanda brought her back, just what she's told him and what the sitcoms require him to know.  Combined with his evasive answers and Wanda remembering something different about the trick-or-treat scenario (that he claims she's just repressing), I think it's someone else making use of the body of **a Pietro** if not Wanda's version of Pietro.  And this is the second time that Wanda has claimed not to know how this started or why she's able to wield reality altering power to this level, this time with no pressure to potentially lie like in the Vision confrontation, which all but guarantees there's a third party involved."
woodboys23,1613121115.0,I think that Agnes wasn’t accounting for JUST HOW POWERFUL Wanda was. She was right at the stop sign for Ellis Ave. (Wanda told the twins to not go past Ellis) and got caught with her car light on by vision even though she shouldn’t have been able to even get there. She could have a sitcom personality and a suppressed personality but her suppressed personality seemed almost excited about the chaos?

Also with the whole “just getting back” thing, I don’t see how thats fair when literally half of the population disappeared. Probably a lot of the members of Sword disappeared as well so it seems weird to hold over their head doesn’t it?"

no Dottie again. 99% she isn't important at all.

Still no Ralph. Agnes was driving alone. Does he even exist?

I expected Vision to instantly fall over dead when trying to leave the town.

Also what's with Pietro? He is completely aware of what is going on.  might be Wanda trying to save herself? having him question her actions cause she can't do it on her own?"

MachJacob,1613121341.0,"It's probably somewhat public knowledge that Pietro got shot there. He never gave any details about his past, talking about one Halloween which Wanda remembered differently, deflecting when asked about the kid in the orphanage, saying that his memories immediately jumped from his death to now (despite knowing that Vision is dead, an event five years ago).

He hasn't said anything that someone probably couldn't find out on wikipedia."
heisholdingacat2,1613121352.0,"Personally, I hope not. I hope that Wanda pulling Pietro from the X-Men universe causes the two universes to be pulled together and ultimately merge into one. As a result, all of the X-Men movies would retroactively take place in the MCU, and everyone's memories would be altered to believe the mutants had always been there. The only people who would remember the way the universe used to be would be Wanda, the residences of Westview, and the SWORD agents.

This would be really convoluted, and probably cause a ton of plot holes, but it would give the mutants more history than if they were all created during one modern-day event. Also, it would allow characters from the X-Men universe to seamlessly transition to the MCU without changing their backstories (Deadpool somehow has to make that transition for Deadpool 3, since it will reportedly take place in the MCU)."

* There were a couple of Mephisto hints this episode, and paired with the magic thing that makes that theory much more likely, but I still think it would be really weird to have him just show up like that.

* All this teasing of The Engineer is especially weird because it goes against the whole ""this is magic"" thing. The only way I can think of it would make sense for a character to show up and actually be useful or plot relevant and live up to all this teasing, if this turns out to be Magic, is if it's Doom. But there's no way...right?"

EmeraldEnigma-,1613121456.0,"This was another exceptional episode that utilized the sitcom era with a Halloween theme to homage comic costumes. 

I was hoping for a mutant reference but I didn’t see any that I know of that gave reasons for Billy and Tommy.

“For the children” theory was that there was no children up until this episode. I wonder what the reason for that is? Did they need to have no children around to that Wanda could focus on wanting children or was she just aware of it since being asked by Vision last time and make children appear? It’s likely there’s another force at here in play and while I still believe that AGatha harkNES will be revealed to be part of a cult/coven as she knows far more than letting on and deceiving Vision to cause a rift between him and Wanda.

Norm had mentioned that “she was doing it/forcing them” which is implied to be Wanda but I think it’s Agnes or Dorothy. 

Pietro’s sus but I’m curious where this goes. Primarily I think the use of “nightmare” may reveal that Nightmare/Mephisto hybrid character is controlling Wanda and used Quicksilver to try and “lower Wanda’s defenses” due to Pietro asking “how she did it”. He was also aware that Wanda was “testing his memory” and would often be rescued by Tommy and would run off together to avoid further questioning.

Everything so far that’s been mentioned has come into play. Pietro was set up in episode 3 to appear at the end of 5 and in ep 6 with possibly few more episodes to go. I am curious to see if Ultron comes out in some form given the name drop as well for killing Pietro. With the mind stone no longer in Vision his body’s defensive a may now be susceptible for a hostile takeover or Ultron allows Hayward to believe he created this A.I to upload into his new Vision.

Commercials - if we are to go by the Trauma Ads theory we have “yo-magic” and a little kid who’s seemingly being drained of his life force/magic. This commercia could’ve been Visión losing the Mind Stone (magic that gave him life) to Thanos. The two actors who I and others believe to be the parents are also not present unless they’re the voices or it could be indicative of the 90s and that she lost her parents around here. 

Another theory was the infinity stones commercials we have the stark toaster (soul/mind), strucker watch (time), hydra soak (space stone), and the red liquid (reality), and now this yo-magic (power stone)

Overall great episode and the mystery continues! So excited for all the new content after what has been such a surreal year.

I just lost my father last week. I honestly have been relating with Wanda more and more. The dead versions of Vision and Pietro were a bit triggering and have a whole new feeling. I feel so bad for Wanda.

Edit: Pietro called the twins demon spawn. Wonder if Nightmare/Mephisto will be combined."

AhhBisto,1613121478.0,"Agnes was definitely play acting with Vision, even when he did his mojo on her. She wasn't even frozen like the others, she was obviously waiting for Vision in order to entice him into leaving the hex. 

Couple of reasons as to why:

1. The trauma from Vision would kickstart Billy's abilities.

2. She knew that him leaving would force Wanda into expanding the hex."
Astronomyinreverse,1613121478.0,That’s exactly what I was thinking. Birthing Hope Summers and an existing Moira McTaggert somewhere in the world could explain away a lot of questions. (I do think the Moira thing would be to complicated to explain though)

inommmz,1613121494.0,"My current theory is that the next phase might be the Phase of Ultron - they bring in mutants, F4, and have Ultron recreated by sword; Stryker/Hayward creates sentinels, they take Vis’ body back and without the mind stone to keep Ultron at bay they unlock him.  Time travel epic for the final Endgame level movie has Wolverine, Invis Woman, and whoever else was in the comic for it going to the past (again) to try to right these wrongs. Possibly involving Thanos and other villains to right the wrongs once Ultron-Sentinal bots have taken over the universe."
theVice,1613121495.0,"I think Hayward is trying to repurpose what's left of Ultron in Vision into what will eventually be the Sentinel program. He obviously dislikes powered people and blames them for the Snap/Blip and all related suffering.

The astrophysicist is either Reed or Talos's kid. It won't be someone that will have no payoff on the reveal.

I already commented this but: there's totally a Halloween decoration near where Wanda and Pietro have their conversation that looks like Venom. It's not really *shaped* like Venom, but it's noticeably and deliberately Venom-y.

Pietro's face might actually be the Pietro from the Fox Universe but whoever is controlling him or masquerading as him is definitely not Pietro. If Mephisto is indeed in the show, it'll be either Pietro or Ralph. With three episodes left, there needs to be a Chekov's gun. Mephisto being all the animals, Pietro, and Ralph the whole time seems likely."

So maybe it wasn't entirely a ruse that she couldn't talk at first, maybe she just forgot the pendant.  I do agree that she seemed to be trying to freak Vision out though.  She fed him just enough information to make him want to leave before suddenly freaking out yelling ""DEAD! DEAD! DEAD!"".  Unlike the previous guy he untethered from the hex for a minute, she was shockingly calm up until the end, almost like she wanted him to stop asking for more details by acting like she was breaking down."

Is there something about being a main character in the scene that gives you more freedom and control? Like to make them act more realistic?

&#x200B;

So I think Nick Scratch/Mephisto/Senor Scratchy are the same. I think Woo's missing person is an X-Man of some kind or something that leads into Doctor Strange, and I REALLY HOPE the astrophysicist is one of the Fantastic Four. But idk if they want to hand WandaVision the introduction to their two biggest Fox properties. It would be especially risky because if people didn't like the show then they potentially fail to stick the landing on both introductions. X-men for sure is being introduced though, especially with the cell alterations and Evan Peters Pietro now in the game."

""Agnes is manipulating Wanda."" She could still be doing this, but when Vision snapped her out of the character, she seemed like another hostage. Again, she could be playing Vision like a fiddle, but she had a similar reaction as Norm did, so that's interesting.

And she’s the first Westview resident to mention Wanda by name when she refers to the mind control? Nah! She even drives away after she accomplishes her mission to get Viz on the edge of town, even though before he pulled her out, she could barely put two sentences together! SUS! Whoever’s doing this are trying to drive a wedge between Wanda and Vision and make everyone else think Wanda’s the bad guy (especially Wanda herself). Why? Still no idea. Want to convince her to do something, I’d guess. On that note, Pietro real sus, too. He’s real flippant about dragging Wanda’s traumas out in front of her and making her feel bad about it, he’s mean, basically backhands her every time he speaks to her; although at the same time, he’s telling her he’s cool with everything she’s doing. Not only that, it seems like he was interrogating her, trying to get her to tell him how she created this illusion. And he sure is making cozy with those kids, too... more of a dad than their “actual” dad. I’m telling you, guys, Wanda is not at the bottom of this. 

I didn’t like this episode as much as the last couple. It was more interested in teasing us with answers rather than giving us any, and it sets up even more besides. Both stories were great, it’s actually a well put together sitcom this time around rather than a good homage to one. I think the bouncing back and forth between the SWORD and Westview plots worked against that this time. Both stories felt like they were getting in the way of the other rather than being complimentary. And it left us on the most unsatisfying cliff hanger ever! Also, what was up with that commercial, that wasn’t immediately connected to Wanda’s past, and it seemed like it was foreshadowing doom... also, straight up mentioned magic. And dead Pietro? Wasn’t Vision like that because he was actually a corpse? Why would X-Men Quicksilver be that way?"

The kids end up disappearing or something but are later brought back as legitimate beings and become young avengers.

A current prevailing theory is that Hayward is Mephisto. I think that when Darcy is on his account it said something along the lines of ‘contacting asset’ and it showed Agnes’ car stopped at Ellis St - this could mean he was trying to contact Agnes/Agatha, who may have been working for Mephisto to manipulate Wanda and she ended up way over her head. Maybe no one including Mephisto/Hayward could predict that when Wanda took over the Hex last episode, that it would cause this static control of the barrier beings and prevent Agnes from having contact with Hayward again. Or maybe it was even before she took over the Hex / reinforced it with her magic. Either way, it seems like he’s losing control of the situation and may break his cover in an episode or two"

- Memories only Wanda and he would know growing up together.

- Intense curiosity of exactly how the hex began and how Wanda’s powers facilitated it. 
- Emotional details to pull at Wanda’s heartstrings and earn her trust and candor."

It is especially apparent due to him having a count of all the residents and knowing those on the outside are being mannequin-ized due to Wanda being over stretched with how much she can control at once."

Maybe Dr Strange got in touch with Professor X and the X-men from an alternate universe (the Fox one I guess) and Professor X did some crazy mind stuff to Quicksilver to help him fit in as her actual brother (like wiping his memory of his actual life).  Could be Dr. Strange reached out for Professor X's help because he's a more powerful telepath that has a chance of stopping Wanda, and they are using Quicksilver to get some info because Wanda wants her brother to be back.

Yea, it's a little out there, but a lot of people think this show is going to be a big part of bring mutants to the MCU so I'm just throwing it out there.

My only problem with what I've said, or your idea that he's been sent in by only Dr. Strange though, is that this doesn't really work with Pietro calling the kids demon spawn and stuff.  He seems a bit more sinister than just being Strange's mole.  Also the way he asked about where Wanda was hiding the kids had a sinister edge to it as well.  It didn't seem like the kind of thing Strange would be concerned with."

RedofPaw,1613122467.0,"Okay, bare with me, the sitcom 'timeline' catches up to 'now' (2020s) and the hex expands to cover the entire world.

bluecheese666,1613122565.0,"I think this version of Pietro is much more than just another character in Westview.

Zaliika,1613122573.0,I feel as though she's losing her grip because she's starting to get confused herself. Like she's realised that she's not 100% in control and trying to figure that out is throwing her off her game.
TheL0neC1pher,1613122576.0,Peters doesn’t scream Wonder Man to me at all though. I’d genuinely just rather someone else play him. I’m still holding out hope that he’s the one Woo was originally looking for in Westview

Like on one hand his dialogue in this episode is really making me think he's Mephisto, but on the other hand we already know that the multiverse is gonna play a huge role in the MCU from now on. Plus it's already confirmed that Deadpool is crossing over. I just really don't know what is gonna happen. It's also kind of hard to predict anything now when Wanda is literally going full on House of M mode."

midnight_artist,1613122604.0,"I doubt it. Rambeau has only been back for a short time, and she seemed more concerned with getting back into SWORD. She also seems to have bad blood with Captain Marvel. However, it would be cool to see her meet Fury since she has that past connection with Carol Danvers and so does Fury. I'm excited for what's to come, and I can tell you are too."
Smak_your_ass,1613122606.0,Around the 19 minute mark she mentions that she is meeting up with her contact who will help her get into the hex. I'm assuming she didn't want Hayward to catch on so she's going to meet up with him at another discreet location.

hermitoftheinternet,1613122618.0,I mean no more than a minute or two after he is introduced Monica is calling him out on the creation of sentient weapons.  Wanda probably didn't find them honoring Vision's will 5 years after he died when she stormed that S.W.O.R.D. facility.

InnocentTailor,1613122653.0,"Well, he definitely proved that because he lost his whole team and most of his vehicles to Wanda’s barrier - they’re all clowns now."

rhcpkam,1613122654.0,"She’s faking. When Norm was awakened, he never said Wanda’s name, only said *her* because he doesn’t know who Agnes is, only hears a female voice. Agnes said Wanda was controlling everything when Vision “awoken her” but she was never even under a spell in the first place. She was pretending to be frozen like everyone else when he came around and couldn’t even hide it as she talked before he woke her up. She’s trying to turn Vision against Wanda and is definitely a big part to all of this"
AssGasorGrassroots,1613122657.0,"My bet is it activates the x-gene in people who have it. For everyone else, insignificant mutations. Monica is different because she's gone through the barrier so many times. As for Darcy, we'll see?"

Also Disney+, keep up with the chaotic duration of the episodes. First Mandalorian, now this!"
Life-Of-Si,1613122679.0,I reckon that tenth episode might be referring to a Disney Gallery Special. Like a behind the scenes documentary episode like they did for mando
nihilisticdaydreams,1613122679.0,That's the great thing about D+. They're bringing cinema-level attention to TV
HyruleBalverine,1613122681.0,I took it as a reference to something feeding on Wanda's magic.
crlos619,1613122682.0,Yeah idk why I thought Vision was VISION Vision.
aure__entuluva,1613122683.0,"Yea for sure, just theorizing :D

And not only was there the ""luke skywalker level"" cameo interview...  I believe that Paul Bettany gave an interview where he mentioned the cameo as well, and the way he spoke about him made it sound like he was some really great actor that he felt honored to work with (and who he hadn't worked with iirc, so probably not Strange).  Don't think that is Evan Peters, no offense to him.  Honestly the way he was speaking about him kinda got me thinking it was someone on the level of Sir Patrick Stewart :o .  But of course that would be a different timeline than Quicksilver so idk.  Could also be MacAvoy he's done some really good stuff."
AdministrationDry783,1613122684.0,"I love how when Wanda expands the Hex, it turned Sword into a bunch of clowns, almost seems like they are a joke and not a threat."
SymbioticCarnage,1613122687.0,"Snackin' on ""Yo-Magic?"" 

It's gotta be"
Uncle_Freddy,1613122688.0,"Agnes is either Agatha Harkness or they’re planting that seed as a red herring. There is ample evidence to suggest my theory is correct, and if she is Harkness, she can quite easily fake feeling the effects of both Wanda’s powers and Vision’s unhooking.

What it really comes down to is if you take what we’re seeing at face value, or if you think they’re dropping clues and think there could be more to it. You could definitely be right—I personally think there is more to Agnes than has been revealed so far though.

Edit: will also add, everybody else on the edge of town was in a loop or outright frozen. Why could Agnes talk? Why was she at the exact street Wanda told the kids not to pass? Why did the subtitles literally describe her laughter as “maniacal?” This plus the fact that, as I said, her name is a portmanteau of Agatha Harkness and she was wearing a witch costume—it’s very easy to see all those oddities align and believe that there is more to Agnes than her simply being another trapped townsperson. IIRC, she was never identified when they were putting together the drivers license photos of all the townsfolk who were in the show either."
MrGreenBeanz,1613122689.0,"Yeah, 30 minutes is really too short for a week long wait."

robbiekomrs,1613122728.0,Parent Trap is about separated twins and The Incredibles is about a family with powers. Sokovia might not have gotten them in theatres at the same time the rest of the world did or it could just be further evidence of her not keeping a grasp on time progression in the hex.
tomandshell,1613122731.0,Are you sure that’s really Quicksilver?
Relugus,1613122732.0,"Well, its obvious she was not happy about coming back. She probably felt her and Vision both dying was the best outcome, and that her coming back alone would be a disaster."
GoddammitCricket,1613122740.0,"Maybe the last two episodes are all outside of the Hex so no sitcom?

Pratar,1613122781.0,"From another comment:

> This would lead to a decent introduction, I think: the mutant gene exists, but it's extremely rare, and only activated in a handful of old mutants, e.g., Professor X, Magneto, Wolverine, etc. This further mutation from the hex, whose effects at some point reach worldwide, activates the gene in a higher percentage of the population, leading to a.) a massive generation of mutants and b.) the old mutants coming out of hiding.

This isn't the *best* introduction per se, but it's the sort of thing Marvel could do to retcon mutants, keep them hidden, and introduce a lot of new ones all at once."

In addition, just from a storytelling/meta standpoint... if QS is Mephisto, I think their choice to make it Evan Peters and not ATJ (assuming it wasn’t by ATJ’s choice, which I guess isn’t a given) makes the twist weaker. Because it’s not the Pietro Wanda knows. But the thing is, I think Marvel knows that. Which is why I think the fact it is Evan Peters makes it significantly less likely Pietro is Mephisto.

The second scene she's in involves her adding ice to her glass. If ice coats something, it's referred to as frost.

She shatters a glass, and wounds herself, perhaps foreshadowing her invulnerability. Glass is a notoriously breakable substance, which contrasts to diamond.

She makes reference to ""white linen"" and seems to dress in white. Her roses also look white, although in black and white it's hard to tell. Emma Frost dresses in white, and is known as the White Queen.

Agnes also refers to her as Queen Cul-de-Sac, which strikes me as weird, but it could be foreshadowing.

She has the personality for it. She's controlling and cold, and occupies a position of power, like Emma Frost.

This one should be obvious, but she looks like Emma Frost.

The Devil's in the details is probably talking about Mephisto, but it may also be referencing the Hellfire club, which Emma is a part of.

The actress's name is actually Emma, but that's not very strong evidence.

She distrusts Wanda, which parallels Emma Frost's murdery attitude towards scarlet witch in the house of M reality."

Ygomaster07,1613123161.0,"Holy fuck, there is a lot to unpack here. So everyone gets there classic costumes, and i assume Tommy wore the same costume as Pietro in the comics, and Billy with the red cape. They both exhibit their respective powers too, that was awesome. A Kickass reference was pretty cool too. That ad was fucked, i have no idea what that was supposed to mean. Vision breaks out and starts disintegrating for some reason. Hayward not only brings up Carol to Monica, but also her mom. I was expecting Monica to jump at him, I'm surprised at her restraint. Pietro knows what's up, he clearly isn't under any mind control. Agnes, who we thought was in on it, actually seems to not be in on it. That shocked me actually. Kathryn was amazing in that scene. Wanda knows Pietro isn't himself. I'm starting to think he may be Mephisto. Calling the children demon spawn. He is literally making references like how us viewers are, like him talking about finally showing other kids. Jimmy and Monica kicked some ass, I'm so glad they gave Jimmy a time to use his combat skills, and I'm glad they gave that to Randall. And it turns out Hayward wants Vision, not Wanda, so I'm assuming that, combined with what Sword know stands for, and why they had Vision's body instead of say, Shield or the Avengers, makes me think he is trying to turn Vision in to some kind tech weapon. Maybe there is an Ultron connection to Hayward? Also, in the previously on WandaVision, they actually showed a clip of ATJ from AoU, which i found weird, considering they never showed him in episode 5 when they showed the picture of Wanda during a riot scene in Sokovia(which we see in AoU and Pietro is next to her). I wonder why they now did this, considering if you are watching the show you would have to know of the past stuff in the MCU, and if you saw last week's episode you could easily find out why they recasted Pietro. I wonder if we will see ATJ in the series yet. And Wanda expands the perimeter to make sure Vision is safe, but also so he probably doesn't finish escaping before she can get to him. Also, now Darcy is in the hex, and we almost got an f bomb from her, but Marvel continues to be coy about it. Seeing a dead Pietro was also weird. Despite Pietro being a recast, i get the feeling he isn't in anyway Quicksilver. He isn't under Wanda's mind control. And is aware of events that have happened, even being aware that he isn't the same Pietro that is Wanda's brother. I was also expecting Darcy to find behind the final firewall something that tells us Hayward is Mephisto.











This gives us some answers, but more questions. The twins have their powers, and it seems Wanda's control over people is slipping. Agnes seems to not be in on whatever is going on. Pietro is in on it it seems, and who is Evan Peters really playing besides this version of Pietro, who clearly isn't the real Pietro. He has the same powers and same name, but that seems about it. So I'm guessing whoever he is is pretending to be this Pietro, and just somehow can give himself Pietro's powers. What is Hayward's motives with Vision? And who is the person Monica and Jimmy are meeting? Doctor Strange, Captain Marvel? Someone from the existing Marvel universe that we haven't seen before in the MCU up to this point? Another guess could be Reed Richards. Who knows at this point. 











What did you guys think of this? It was definitely amazing. I'm not sure if this tops episode 5 for me. I'm definitely gonna rewatch it. Did you guys like this episode more than episode 5? And do you think Evan Peters is playing a different character who is pretending to be Pietro and simply copying his name and abilities?"

inommmz,1613123239.0,"Wanda has no clue how these thing started. She barely (if at all) remembers grabbing vision from the sword base.

It all starts with “for the children” and then she has kids, who aren’t under her control and are magically aging and picking up powers from her dead brother and dead husband.

Dead brother appears, has independence from her, is fourth wall breaking, and seems to be poking her similar to Agnes

Agnes is also independent, and knows to wait for re-shoot queues and seemed to have been involved in the kids aging (they age each time when she’s around). She also seemed to maybe be provoking Vision to leave the Hex.

Agnes constantly referred to a husband we still have not seen.

Pietro’s lines saying “unleash hell” and describing the children as demon spawn. Also his hair looking devilish.

The Shangri La reference (shangri la being a paradise hell).

While Wanda seems to have control over people, who were involved in the town before the Hex, it may be those brought in or snuck in (like Monica) are able to talk to her. Could lead to Agnes/Agatha being brought in by Hayward/Mephisto as an inside agent before Monica was involved.
 
It could be something else entirely, you’re right, but a lot of the things in the MCU that are changed, change only to better the line of a comic run or event. And this seems to stem from three specific Scarlet Witch events that include Mephisto as a big bad, as well as Wanda herself."

BambooSound,1613123304.0,"Especially because he die die twice - once by Wanda and once by Thanos.

So the question is how does this Pietro know that Vision is supposed to be dead, but unaware of the fact Wanda killed him first? It'd mean that he's probably someone who was alive after AoU but not someone who'd have had intimate knowledge of the events of Infinity War (the way someone like Mephisto or Kang would).

Leaves me to think Pietro is possibly a Skrull. Maybe Hayward is aware of Skrull Team 6 and he feigns anti-alien bias to keep people of the scent. We already know that he doesn't really care that much about Wanda or the anomaly - he just wants Vision's corpse back. Painting Wanda as an immediate threat accelerates the process of getting that back because he knows they'll never be able to convince her."

AveUnit02,1613123346.0,"Good points. Although this Pietro is extremely self aware and even refers to himself as the holiday cameo guest character.

To me, it seems like he’s just something to tide over Wanda. Help her with her grief. She can’t manifest ATJ because his dead body is buried somewhere and she didn’t go grab him knowing she’d bring him back, I think this is all just sweet fan service."

TwoDisguised,1613123446.0,"Interesting theory. My guess that this is Fox Quicksilver, and he is actually trying to help Wanda.

Fox Quicksilver heard some things about MCU Quicksilver, which is why he knows the basics of what happened. Since he doesn't know specifics about MCU Quicksilver, he avoids talking about it and changes the subject like the accent and the orphanage thing.

TheTruckWashChannel,1613123527.0,"Crazy episode! Some thoughts:

- This show overtly homages past sitcoms but I'm noticing a lot of similarity/influence from contemporary series as well, mainly Westworld. Some of the sitcom bits also remind me of the Adrian Veidt sequences in HBO's Watchmen series. Definitely one of the most creatively bold things to come out of the MCU.

- The Vision scenes in this episode were mesmerizing and finally made use of film-level visual effects to depict his appearance and abilities. That whole scene where he finds the frozen bodies and the edge of the map were wonderfully surreal.

- This show is really experimenting with horror, first with the dead Vision and now with the Quicksilver jump scare. Reminded me of Haunting of Hill House. I hope this means that the Doctor Strange sequel will indeed venture into the horror genre, and that those plan's didn't die with Scott Derrickson's departure.

- About Quicksilver: his whole appearance in Wanda's world is a major mystery, but I'm sure that the sight of him with the bullet holes in his body was just a hallucination, and that Wanda is somehow not reanimating his 6-year old desiccated corpse into Evan Peters.

- The SWORD HQ getting eaten up into the sitcom world is both very exciting and rather hilarious.

- The biggest question I have right now is how Vision has free will while in Wanda's world, since she's the one actively animating his dead body. I actually expected his body to go gray and drop dead the moment he stepped outside the forcefield (perhaps his slow disintegration was actually killing him rather than sucking him back inside) but the fact that he was even able to ""question the nature of his reality"" (as they say in Westworld) let alone escape is what baffles me a little. Perhaps Wanda simply brought his entire consciousness back online but simply wiped his memory (the latter of which was confirmed in this episode) and just by his personality/intelligence he's prone to questioning his existence and trying to discern the truth of what's going on. No matter the answer, it raises some interesting psychological questions at a level far deeper than what I'm used to in the MCU, so kudos to this series for its conceptual ambition."

But I do genuinely believe this is going to be the Fox universe Quicksilver; I think he may even end up getting a moment like Norm, where he wakes up and realizes he’s in an entirely different reality.  

One thing I found interesting is that despite being Evan Peters, the effects for his speed powers in today’s episode looked more like ATJ QS effects than the effects of Peters’s QS. I think once he wakes up to his true self we could see that visual change.  

And I just think from another meta/storytelling stand point I can’t see the writers sitting there like “we’ll cast the SAME guy from the X-men and then not lead into anything related to mutants at all.” If they wanted to make the point that she can’t manifest ATJ’s body like she did Vision, then why did they specifically choose the guy they knew would make everyone assume it’s leading to the x-men if they weren’t intentionally doing so

But I think Marvel is trying to be really careful and planned out about how they do do the X-Men so I don’t think they’d take something like this and potentially mess that up.  I think if they’re choosing to bring the same guy who played QS from the Foxverse over, it’s definitely an intentional move towards mutants. 


But hey at the end of the day it’ll be something none of us see coming (quicksilver pun intended)"

The_Mysterious_L,1613123710.0,"""Cataract"". If you search ""cataract"" on Wikipedia, the first sentence in the article defines it as ""A cataract is a cloudy area in the lens of the eye that leads to a **decrease in vision**"".

What is Hayward and SWORD up to?

* In Ep 4 Hayward says that SWORD switched from space exploration to AI research. Monica notes that the OR in SWORD is supposed to stand for observation and response, ""not creation"".

* In Ep 5 Hayward reveals that SWORD had Vision's corpse in their facility. They were clearly experimenting on him.

* Now in Ep 6 Hayward chastises Monica for having the luxury to still be optimistic.

Is Hayward trying to rebuild Vision? Or improve upon him? Is he trying to build Jocasta? Is he trying to study Ultron? Create Machine Man, or the Super-Adaptoid? Is Hayward a reimagining of Baron Brimstone - a criminal who covers up his tech-based skills by pretending it's magic? Is SWORD being manipulated by the Technarchy?"

Doctor strange could have told FOX Quicksilver about the past MCU things. This would only be a possible idea if FOX Quicksilver is there to help Wanda. If he's there for a bad reason, it would be because the villain which hasn't been shown yet, has brought in FOX Quicksilver and manipulated him to keep making Wanda get more powerful or lose control"

LittleYellowFish1,1613124182.0,"To start with, I never realised how much I wanted Woo to have an action/fight scene, but that was great. I’m 100% on board with a SWORD series now.

I think things are still fuzzy regarding who “Pietro” is. Woo doesn’t recognise him when he looks at the footage so I guess that rules out him being the first missing person, and the fact that Pietro tells Wanda he came to town to “stir up trouble” and cause her grief, as well as his line “that’s what you wanted, right?” is either a massive misdirect or it’s foreshadowing that he really is Mephisto (it doesn’t help that he pulls a scary face at Wanda right after Vision leaves).

On a side not, I’m going to assume that Tommy referring to Pietro as “kick-ass” was *not* an intentional in-joke, but it’s still pretty funny regardless.

I’m guessing that Agnes and the other people frozen at the edge of the town were trying to escape or they tried to resist the narrative so their character was stripped away, and Agnes went back into character because Vision “reset” her. Though the fact that Agnes’ real form cackled like a witch was a bit suspicious.

When Vision got out I was expecting Wanda to just drag him back in, or expand the wall just enough for him to be back in Westview. I was **not** expecting her to take over the whole camp and go even further than that. It’s probably the most frustrating cliffhanger yet, though I will say that I’m looking forward to Darcy’s TV persona."

whacafan,1613124415.0,I thought this one had a lot of crappy writing and shady acting. But that could have something to do with this being a half hour sitcom/not sitcom that has crazy stakes but also has to reset them at the beginning of each new episode/also but not do that outside the hex. Definitely a challenge.
LokiSonOfAsgard,1613124419.0,"That is an AWESOME cliffhanger! First, I thought she was going to *break* the Hex in order to save him, but instead....HOLY SHIT. I still don't know whether Pietro is tricking Wanda or he legitimately believes she is *his* Wanda. "
Cjjamess,1613124423.0,I have a theory. So when Wanda got the feeling that peitro died in aou and bursted that energy. She probably did that same thing after the funeral after realizing she was so alone and she created the hex and now in episode 6 when she thought vision was dying she did the burst again making the hex bigger.

hunta-gathera,1613124425.0,"So this episode:

- basically confirms Hayward was experimenting on Vision trying to make a weapon and that’s why Wanda stole his body back 

- Further showcasing how powerful Wanda is. 

- Still showcasing how Wanda is in control, but giving pretty clear hints that she didn’t start it and has fallen for the fantasy given to her 

- Gives the Twins their powers. Carbon copies of Wanda and Pietro 

- Confirms Monica will get powers because of crossing the barriers (twice) 

- was way too short :( 

An interesting tidbit is that Pietro seems to be fishing for information. Wanda is being gaslit. Intentionally or unintentionally by Pietro. And Agnes was for sure gaslighting Vision this episode further diving them. 

Everyone is claiming Wanda is calling them or in their heads. But Wanda doesn’t even seem to be sure of anything herself so that seems like a red herring still. 

The 2000s are going to be insane. I think Wanda and Vision will have split in that episode.

What happens if they get hit by it? What happened to Monica Rambeau could be a clue.

Her cellular structure is changing, rewriting themselves, or you could say they are.... MUTATING.

> Thing is when you insert foreign bodies into the Hex, its shape and structure get affected. We know how it goes for drones and clothes, but as far organism goes, the deal could be different. She was existing in a whole another reality and then got kicked out. Considering the cosmic wavelength that got peeped by Darcy, her body could have been reconstructed by these wavelengths, which would pretty much explain Monica powers.

https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/ld4cfk/something_i_noticed_in_episode_5/gm56w39/

But I don't think it's how mutants gonna happen. It's just Monica's origin story. Mutants' source is the 3 gamma explosions that happened on Earth. That's the only planetary scale phenomenon that can potentially rewrite DNA. Plus, considering the whole timeline of the phase 4, I don't think it's necessary to introduce mutants now while they will be irrelevant later on."

Typically he just wants to chill out and occasionally make a deal to get something and when he does decide to mess around on Earth it's usually just giving Blackheart or Vengeance a task so that he can get them off his back. Now that I think about it it would be hilarious if it turned out he orchestrated this whole thing just so that he had a TV show to watch and get Agnes fuck off and he's just laughing as the whole thing gets worse for everyone."

jdevo91,1613124836.0,"My theory at this point:

Ralph is Agnes' dead husband. Wanda does know who Agnes is despite ""meeting"" her in episode one. She helped her get Vision out of Sword's facility and brought him somewhere (Westview for some reason) and brought him back to life using a new mind stone (from another reality). Here is where Wanda creates the Hex as a coping mechanism, including Agnes. Agnes has more control than others though and more willfully plays along, possibly in attempts to get Wanda into bringing Ralph back.

Hayward was messing with Vision's corpse in attempts to make it into a weapon. Wanda obviously saw this when getting him out, and it's why she's so hostile towards Sword specifically.

Quicksilver is FOX Peter. Wanda attempted to bring back Pietro, which she assumed failed, and this is the unintended result of her trying. In episode 6, she has him written as a character who is more aware of what is going on and provides a way of her feeling less guilty/crazy, but for some reason has less of a hold on him.

Vision and the new mind stone are destroyed by the end. This causes a rift in the multiverse (MoM) as the mind stone never got back to its reality, as warned by The Ancient One.

There's obviously a lot of empty spaces here but this is where I think it's going."

I don’t think he cares about Wanda or the people trapped, it seems like he is okay with potentially killing them all to get to Vision. Them tracking him as decaying vibranium and the director letting Vision just rot away again is what has me leaning this direction. What exactly does he want vibranium for? SWORD does deal with a lot of space stuff in the comics so I’m thinking he either wants it for some sort of space craft OR he is actually a Skrull trying to get a hold of vibranium as part of the upcoming Skrull plot that will lead into Secret Invasion."
BambooSound,1613125001.0,"Yes but he has a penchant for showing up unexpectedly so an early arrival would make sense.

Plus, he's well placed to have the ability to harness Wanda's power without completely understanding it. I don't think Mephisto would ask so many questions and this entire operation seems nothing like Magneto's vibe.

If it is Mephisto I hope they get Nathan Fillion to play him and have him goad Wanda about being in a simulation."

Her children then pushed her to bring back Pietro after sparky died by implanting the idea of ressurecting the dead. Which Agnes was also involved with sense she ""found"" the dog.

Why would you think that?

They're literally just being hexed same as everyone else.

You can't ""create mutants"" unless you're like Elixir and you can literally create X-Genes. What we see with Maria is just how you get ""human mutates"".

Like, mutants were created specifically because Stan Lee and Jack Kirby were getting tired of giving everyone superpowers through radiation and cosmic rays. If those people become mutants it'd be a massive kick in the teeth to the comics. Completely disrespectful to the source material."

Compare it to Modern Family, which has a cut to the ""interview"" parts.

The intro is also straight out of Malcolm with the VHS/home videos and the font fizzling in and the cast coming on during the pause.

> Also dismissed the thought because this is a 90s episode, right? And that was 2000s.

When Darcy says that Monica's cells have been rewritten twice, this means that she's evolving.

Then Monica says that she knows what Wanda is feeling and she won't stop until she helps her. That's because of the Mind Stone. It's also because she is part of the network. The Matrix. But she's free.

Pietro says that she handled the ethical considerations of the scenario as best she could. In the opening credits they mentioned this being a game. Wanda is being tested.

MutantCreature,1613125810.0,"the only ones that I think even could directly allude to Mephisto given what we know so far:

>Agnes constantly referred to a husband we still have not seen.

could be him, could be just a play on the old ""absent character"" trope, could be both, could be Deadpool

>Pietro’s lines saying “unleash hell” and describing the children as demon spawn. Also his hair looking devilish.

again could be but could also just be his demeanor based on previous scenes and the X-Men films, I don't think the hair is relevant outside of the comic reference

>The Shangri La reference (shangri la being a paradise hell).

wasn't Shangri-la basically just a paradise but where the citizens continued to age instead of dying? it feels more like he was just talking about how him and Vision are dead, who knows about others

>While Wanda seems to have control over people, who were involved in the town before the Hex, it may be those brought in or snuck in (like Monica) are able to talk to her. Could lead to Agnes/Agatha being brought in by Hayward/Mephisto as an inside agent before Monica was involved.

there's definitely more to Hayward but I do not think he is Mephisto even if Mephisto is in the show, he seems more like  a run of the mill ""military guy who keeps escalating the situation because he wants something nefarious"" my guess is to create ""sentient weapons"" but who knows"

vTweak,1613125890.0,"So I think this is such a brilliant way to add mutants, not only to explain why they haven’t existed in this universe, and to avoid saying they have this whole time and just have been in the shadows, but because one of my concerns with adding mutants to the MCU was getting public sentiment to be very aggressive towards most super powered individuals. I think that Wanda messing up the world and changing peoples lives/DNA literally weeks after half the world has come back and is trying to rebuild towards some sort of normalcy, could certainly be the catalyst towards public sentiment going against super hero’s in general. I mean imagine if overnight, a chunk of the population got super powers, some good people, some bad people, some good people with destructive powers. The world, already recovering from chaos would inch more towards chaos. 

Now the only problem with this theory is the gap between this and Far From Home where this sentiment wasn’t there. Maybe at some point during the climax, Wanda will either temporarily engulf the planet with the hex and make people forget about it for the most part, or there will be a blast of her power that just sweeps through the earth that doesn’t necessarily change anything but the radiation/energy still effects some people. And maybe there is a random time delay where people’s powers could lay dormant for a while until slowly, the population of mutants starts to rise.

ikanx,1613125893.0,"Honestly, I don't think it's Mephisto

- out of all MCU story, the villain is almost always foreshadowed/shown early. Probably in the first 3rd. But we haven't seen anything related to Mephisto except some easter egg and dialogues.
- it being hinted in easter egg and dialogue makes me think that the Mephisto ""wink"" from the showrunner is only a misdirection/fanservice for fans and not really intended for full appearance
- if Mephistois indeed behind all of this, imo he should be atleast hinted in eps 1-4. For example, in this episode, Wanda told Pietro that she felt ""alone"". If she said she heard someone saying something about power or bringing someone back from the dead, that could very well be Mephisto. But we didn't get that. if Mephisto shows up in last 2 eps, general audience would just be confused about this new Mephisto character.

Needless to say, I'm still confused about the situation. My first theory was it's all/mostly Agnes. But she seems to be controlled like others albeit she's a bit weird/different. Looking forward to next ep. I'd enjoy this week long discussion lol."

Bweryang,1613126182.0,">Pietro too now. He appeared dead to her 

I really don't think that matters. It's not her Pietro, so he shouldn't appear that way. To me, it just shows that this stuff is flashes of Wanda's trauma, not the actual physical condition of the people in the Hex. I mean Vision didn't look that way when he left the Hex. The visions of dead characters aren't Wanda seeing reality I don't think, just the truth of her experience intruding on her fake reality if that makes sense. Remains to be seen obviously, but that's what I'm getting."

MarvelousNCK,1613126495.0,"So Vision, Quicksilver, and maybe Agnes are the only ones not fully under Wanda's control. 

I wonder how and why Quicksilver suddenly showed up. Beyond the fact that he's from a different dimension and the implications of what that means, it feels like he's trying to get information for something or someone. After getting Wanda to trust him by answering all her questions and bringing up childhood anecdotes, he suddenly starts questioning her about why she's doing this and how she's managing everything.

It's definitely kinda strange, and I feel like there's something about him we don't know yet."
OniNyte22,1613126506.0,So the episode description says something like “two super powered beings find out suburban life isn’t all it seems” I know that’s not right. One was vision who was the other? Both quicksilver and Wanda knew it was messed up

Stommped,1613126510.0,"But there also seems to be 2 different types of mind controlling going on.  There's people like Norm and the Doctor who don't seem to acknowledge anything is wrong, unless Vision does his thing.  Then there's someone like Herb who is willing to just ask Wanda if she wants him to do something different, like he's in full control of his mind, just playing the part.

I think the Monica thing you brought up is also a good example.  If Wanda was mind controlling her, how or why would that Ultron question get asked?  Right before this scene happens we see Agnes telling Vision that Monica isn't from around here, she has no husband, etc. etc.  Couldn't it be that Agnes influenced Monica to ask that question, knowing that Wanda would send her flying? Exactly what Agnes wanted."

He is interrogating her for something he wants. The forces Hayward was talking about are the shape shifters we saw in Captain Marvel and the Kree who are hunting them down. Earth is defenseless after the Thanos Snap. Shield is gone and SWORD is crippled. Half the avenger were snapped and the other half wallowed in defeat and just focused on living and revenge. So Mephisto is the main villain but he is weaken because of Thanos Snap. The Yo-Magic commercial. So he is being helped by someone and it is more than likely the Kree who Captain Marvel fought at the end of her movie.

He informs him on what's happening, why he needs his help, that this version of Quicksilver died, and everything leading up to this point.

He goes in, tries to learn how this all started and gather some intel for Doctor Strange. He slips up though. Obviously he doesn't remember Pietro and Wanda's childhood memories, he deflects each time she mentions something, and if the last thing he actually remembered was being shot on the street and then her calling him... he wouldn't have known that Vision was dead.

MrNewblez,1613127571.0,"My biggest question too and the only reason I still believe in Mephisto, Nightmare, etc type theories. I think even if Wanda did all this accidentally by herself that is fucking horrific. Even by accident I don’t see a well-earned redemption without pretty much the entire rest of her arc in the MCU being dedicated to it. Losing control like that and fucking over so many people is totally unacceptable even if it’s an accident. And who wants to see Wanda go through the same thing she did in Civil War. I believe Wanda’s best arc here is working through her pain, building new bonds (Monica, her children, Strange), and coming out stronger. But that all rings hollow if she just kidnapped an entire town.

Clearly she’s culpable and even in control on some level, but there needs to be another entity manipulating her or I just don’t see any redemption any time soon."

Cockycent,1613127590.0,"Poor lady is a vegetable. People closest to the barrier are too out of Wanda's reach to continue their roles properly and it's most likely why Wanda didn't want Vision going too far out because he'd peep that and the fact that he wasn't doing exactly what she wanted

They said Kick Ass. They said it. They said it. Both Pietros were in it.

Darcy in there now. She gets a turn to play a role. 

I was hoping to see Monica's contact, but oh well

Was that some kind of figure or a person while they were trick or treating? It felt like it or he/she was staring at Wanda when she spoke to Herb. The house behind her must have like a scarecrow or somethin

That yo magic ad further makes me suspect that there's another influence at play. Monica's clothes kept it's bulletproof properties, but changed appearance. Everything Vision gained was being taken back as he left. The commercial kid died because he couldn't get yo magic (your magic). Without ""magic"", you're done

Pietro is getting memories backwards that Wanda is questioning. I like the effects for Tommy's speed.

The Coronet was playing the Incredibles and The Parent Trap. Family with super powers and Twins getting to know each other respectively.

For anyone still reluctant to suspect Hayward by now, good luck.

Damn, Monica has barely processed her mother's death and that is driving her to want to save Wanda at the cost of her own health. You can tell when she mentioned knowing about how cells look in remission. Her moms test results had to be constantly reviewed, now it's hers. This is how she becomes Spectrum or Photon

Darcy mentioned that once she made it through Hayward's firewall, she'd find something big. Maybe that's why Darcy is being put there from a narrative's perspective. Maybe she could still expose Wanda's possible ""influence"" while inside.

Then there's Project Cataract concerning Vision being weaponized. Cataract has to do with your vision getting cloudy. Maybe they were planning on using Vision and Wanda came to stop it, then they clouded her vision, made her confused and now she's doing all this. Would make sense why Hayward keeps antagonizing her.

SenseiCopperbottom,1613127741.0,"Good question! I don't have good answer, but I think it will be a very important piece of the puzzle when we find out. They certainly emphasized the stone for Vision's transformation this ep.

A couple of possibilities for giggles:

- it's entirely illusory and its effects in the hex are really Wanda's powers acting by proxy. The yellow colour when Vision 'wakes up' someone's true mind would be harder to explain this way, though

- it's been borrowed from another reality. Perhaps this the hex was formed as a kind of gateway, and now Wanda wants to stay in the bubble where the realities overlap and the stone can hold Vision together. That would be pretty out there, but might help explain Pietro* turning up I guess.

*(I don't think that's pietro, fwiw)"

Just because he's made of vibranium doesn't mean Wakanda automatically claims ownership of him. He was essentially a living being. Also, I've seen so many people ask how Vision's body left Wakanda.

Moreover, we’re already seeing people who innately hate super humans. Hayward is clearly one of them. Some of the antagonist from Falcon and Winter Soldier similarly hate super humans for simply existing, if the trailers are to be believed.

Two questions for the comic readers:

1) Pietro name-drops 'Shangri-La'. That could just be a reference to the IRL concept, but does it mean anything more in the comics? Isn't that where Iron Fist is from? (I admit I gave up on that show after a couple of episodes).

2) The theory here is that Agnes is Agatha Harkness. Seems likely as she clearly knows more than she lets on (Seems likely to me that her scene with Vision was her doing a bit). But isn't Agatha Harkness one of Wanda's allies? I read that in the comic she's the one that trains her, and also that she sacrifices herself for her at some point? So why does everybody think Agnes is the bad guy ?"

Zemo learned his techniques to manipulate powered people instead of fighting them directly there, and Alice Eve's character from Iron Fist season 2 who can't remember how she killed all the soldiers and escaped captivity in the Sokovian War can't remember because of that.

The ad refers to her being a starving orphan through the 90s and trying to get to her magic, but it was sealed tight and she was dying. It wasn't until the mindstone unlocked the suppressed memories of her and Pietro that they began to recover their abilities."

I'm gonna say he recognizes Darcy in whatever character she ends up playing, he mentions *the avengers,* and she gets her memory back and helps him figure out what is going on.

TheAsian1nvasion,1613128363.0,I’m 1000% sure Hayward is a Skrull. He tried to kill Wanda because he wanted to remove her from a future invasion resistance.

WoottonMajor,1613128600.0,"So, IMO the commercials all directly reference each of the movies Wanda’s appeared in (apart from the first being her backstory). The Hydra Soak one threw me, but after last week they’re just too on the nose to be anything else now. Don’t get me wrong I think they all have multiple meanings within the context of the show, but thematically each is tied to a movie: 

Ep 1 - The Toaster - Backstory - Stark missile 

Ep 2 - Strucker Watch - Captain America: Winter Soldier (post credit scene) - Strucker experimenting on Wanda. 

Ep 3 - Hydra Soak - Avengers: Age of Ultron - hydra brainwashing her to fight the Avengers (I think the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. soap reference is just a nice Easter egg)

Ep 5 - Lagos Paper Towels - Captain America: Civil War - Lagos incident where she caused dozens of civilian casualties. 

Ep 6 - Yo-magic - Avengers: Infinity War - not surviving the snap (the snack for survivors) and her magic not saving Vision or stopping Thanos. 

Ep 7 - should reference Endgame. And being the last of the “sit-com episodes” it’ll probably be the last commercial so it would make sense."

Nolesman357,1613128667.0,"Hot take but I can totally understand where Director Hayward is coming from in his handling of the situation. It seems like the show is going out of their way to make him a dick which is probably due to bad writing (for literally just this character; the rest of the show is amazing) and at this point is a big cliche. Nevertheless I get where he’s coming from because he’s trying to control the situation, which he can’t, and there’s literally an entire town being held against their will. The show is still trying to convince us that Wanda is good, and I’m not saying she’s not, but it’s pretty fucked up what she’s doing. I don’t care how much grief she’s feeling. There isn’t any good excuse for why Wanda is doing all of this to all of these people. From Hayward’s perspective he’s trying to fix it, and Jimmy and the gang are getting in the way. Also I assume we’re just supposed to accept Monica’s theory that Wanda is the solution and she knows what she’s doing. That probably is the case but logically it doesn’t make a whole of sense. Hayward bringing up Carol Danvers and her dead mom was a dick move and this guy just seems like your cliche “person in charge has to do everything their way and they actually have their own ulterior motives so then ragtag team of protagonists have to stop them”. This is my one gripe with the show. It just seems like they’re making Hayward out to be evil for no reason. Maybe I just think this because I can understand his POV and what he’s trying to do.

Something seemed very suspicious about Pietro. He definitely wanted to find out a lot more about Wanda. Also, that scene with injured Pietro is so good. I've just watched it again and it still shocked me. It seemed like a really genuine chat between the twins (even though Pietro seemed a bit suspicious) so then seeing injured Pietro was such a shock.

&#x200B;

I loved seeing Vision investigate the town. Him seeing the towns people who couldn't move and then the one crying was creepy.

&#x200B;

I have my doubts about Agnes being a bad guy. I think she might be trying to escape, which would explain why her car was parked on the edge. She seems to want to create tension between Wanda and Vision which has lead to Vision finding out things he wasn't meant to.

&#x200B;

The scenes with SWORD were also really good. They are definitely building up Monica's contact and I am looking forward to seeing Darcy inside the Hex.

DeadSweetHenrietta,1613129388.0,"Its a legitimate question.  The last time we saw his dead body that's where he was. And before that they were trying to back him up. If the Avenger's wanted to continue to try to fix him somehow that was obviously the best place to leave his body 

And if the Avenger's took his body back immediately, how did SWORD get him from them? Did they just hand it over? They didn't care to check and see what was being done with him? How long have they been studying him?  

Are those questions silly too? Do you have a condescending, pulled out of your ass, shitheel answer for those?  I'm soooo sorry I'm not aware of every question that's being asked that you're sick of seeing.

It's painful but it's what TV shows need to be when you have such a huge element of mystery. 

The episode itself - Malcolm in the Middle is the first TV show I've actually watched it's referring to. So picking up on all the little things for it made it so much cooler, the keyboard-based background music, swipe effects when switching scenes, even the house was modelled so close to the set of the original. (Side note: this also infuriates me that Malcolm still isn't on Disney+)   


Pietro being fully aware he shouldn't be there is an interesting take, I'm sure this will be some form of manipulation of whoever is in the background. The Kick-ass joke was so brutally on the nose it shattered the bone and I fucking love it. 

The advert saying the kid will die if he doesn't break the seal makes me think that Vision could have survived leaving Westview if he had broken past the barrier completely."

If Mephisto is behind some of this and is just trying to make Wanda think she's doing this so he can get at her YoMagic as he's very hungry, it feels like the joke's that the devil can watch movies (and sitcoms) in the multiverse, not just Disney films.

Maybe there were certain stipulations that Fox had as well as ATJ saying he'd only do it if it was a single film contract, I don't completely remember.

Btw I don't really think Peter's death did much for Hawkeye's character arc. Besides caring about Wanda a bit more than the others (which is natural given he's a father and she's an orphan) it didn't really affect him as a character at all."
niko2710,1613129708.0,"The Pietro that we see is not the one of the Fox movie. His power are shown differently (no za warudo scene and with blue stripes) and doesn't have memories from the Fox universe. He is either THE bad guy or a creation of the bad guy. 

Agnes is definitely Agatha, when everyone is dressed in their costumes she is dressed like a witch, also her ramblings pushed Vision to the edge, she is messing with Wanda.

Dottie = Emma Frost?

Right now she controls everything, but Monica’s cells changing signals that people who interact with the hex mutate... so it would make sense everyone inside is a mutant."

Hungrypeach44,1613129719.0,"So unless Wanda’s being controlled or manipulated someway, she’s practically a villain at this point right? granted a very light villain but she’s worse than say Ghost is and she was classified as a villain.

I mean if Wanda is either in control or aware something is wrong and that people are being controlled and in pain, and is making no attempt to do anything she is arguably just as bad some of the MCU villains right? 

Especially when you also consider she unleashed the Hulk on a city in Age of Ultron. 

Sure she might have a tragic past and experience but that doesn’t make what she’s doing or aware of any better at all. Sympathetic sure, but that just means she’s a tragic villain."

Remember, Shuri was dusted too. There was no one left in Wakanda who knew how to do that. And considering their King was also dusted, Wakanda was probably busy going through their own problems.

> And if the Avenger's took his body back immediately, how did SWORD get him from them? Did they just hand it over?

Ozryela,1613130322.0,"It was shown last episode that Wanda doesn't just create illusions. She's actually altering reality. Monica's clothes were changed when she entered the Hex, and remained changed when the left.

It's implied that Wanda can't bring back the dead. But that doesn't mean she can't recreate their bodies. It would be strange for her to physically change the clothes of people who randomly wander in, but then leave her dead boyfriend as a mere illusion.

I don't think Vision is just a puppet either. He seems to have a will on his own independent of Wanda. No idea where the show is going with that yet."

I'm not even saying that's what happened, It's not impossible though. And instead of basically calling me a moron, for asking. ( Which you did twice by implying I was too stupid to remember or know about Shuri being dusted), you could have just followed up with a legitimate discussion.

Does this episode throw Agnes being a witch out the window or maybe they made her much weaker than Wanda?

It's probably much easier to change an alive person's personality whilst their own brains fill in the rest than to constantly have to provide every little detail about dead people (Vision and Pietro) and so her memories and her control of her own body and mind slips into them.
Lawlcopt0r,1613130421.0,"I think she was just self-conscious enough to try to leave, but this was as far as she got before the Hex stopped her.

It doesn't have to be him, they could use so many other characters for that role. If it was Reed then it would just be a cameo for shock value. 

I disagree, I think it'd actually be a clever move: they'd be pre-establishing Reed Richards as the genius scientist he is prior to the Fantastic Four movie, easing up the likely retell of their origin story to move the story along quicker."

I think he's missing pieces where Shield tore him apart, and those are being sucked back in (although the fact that they don't immediately vanish outside seems to me like the Hex is working extra hard to keep Vision intact). The pieces were just simulations made by Wanda to get him functioning, that's why they can't stay outside. By that logic, I think his forehead is simulated as well, which means it would have eventually vanished too, and I don't think it's the actual mindstone, just an approximation of it thst couldn't exist outside the Hex"

But... They all seem to know at some point. The doctor tried to leave Westview but he couldn’t: “Small towns, you know, so hard to scape”. Mrs Hart was asking Wanda to stop very literally. Herb is aware that Wanda is in control of everything in E6 but he can’t always control himself, for example when he was cutting the wall instead of the grass. The postman says to Billy and Tommy when they are looking for the dog that “her mother won’t let him go very far away”. Dottie knows for sure ( when she said I assure you I don’t mean anyone any harm and Dottie replies I don’t believe you). And even Phil knows. During the show he says that was my grandmother’s piano. And of course there is Agnes “Here is the star of the show”, “should we just take it from the top?” And even Monica woke up for a moment when Wanda is really sad thinking about Pietro and singing in sokovian.

Wanda is controlling all of them, she almost admitted it to Vision “you can’t control me the way you control them.” “Can’t I?”

My take here is that Wanda is controlling everything but since the pregnancy she is starting to have problems to keep herself in the fantasy world she created. Like she is waking up from the fake reality and the rest of the characters with her..."
random_guy_somewhere,1613130828.0,I think she was pretending to be under control to further push Vision to go beyond the boundary. My theory is whoever is manipulating this wants Wanda to keep expanding Westview so it can then take over and have control over a large portion of the population

He clearly isn't affected by Wanda's mind control, since he's very aware of what she's up to and even presses her about it. With that information, if he was from the X-Men universe and ALSO unaffected by Wanda's powers, how come he ""remembers"" growing up in Sokovia? How come he ""remembers"" events differently from Wanda? How does he not remember his own universe?

I have a feeling this ""Pietro"" is someone that knows who Wanda and Pietro are, but doesn't have the context surrounding his death and their lives growing up.

Talos' daughter, Adam Brashaer and Riri Williams are all much more natural choices imo. Reed has knowledge in all different areas of science. He isn't primarily focused on Aerospace Engineering.

nightwingoracle,1613132049.0,"That’s parallel how then Inhumans set up started on AOS- people,having the gene then getting exposed/activating.

I’m not certain that x-pietro is x-pietro-  he could be Mephisto or someone else. So that might not be an issue.

The new mutants gene activated theory would also mean they couldn’t introduce Narmor, which would be disappointing. Though he could be introduced as a non-mutant. I can live without apocalypse and I think that we need a rest from Wolverine due to how connected Hugh Jackman is to the role.

I'm thinking it might be Fox Quicksilver being forced into the role of MCU Quicksilver. He defects a lot of questions that anyone but Wanda and Pietro would know, which is why I don't think it's just a recast.

Alternatively, he's simply not real, and is just there to keep things on script after Vision went rogue last episode, Either by a true mastermind, or by Wanda subconsciously, depending how things play out."

Demileto,1613132153.0,"Fair enough. I think it's because he's the most high profile Marvel genius character to still not be featured on the MCU, we know a movie is finally coming to fix this and properly introduce the First Family in the universe, and they've been building up Monica's contact for the last two episodes to not be someone significant.

miba54,1613132256.0,"He makes two statements that have contradictory implications. First he says the last thing he remembers is dying in AoU, which would make him the MCU Quicksilver. However, later in the episode he says ""Your dead husband can't die twice,"" which means he knows about the events of IW, but MCU Quicksilver wouldn't know the events of IW because by that point he'd already been dead for three years. 

So... is he just someone else completely? Not Quicksilver at all? Evan Peters is just a cameo?  People are saying he's a resident, he's Mephisto, he's Nightmare, he's an agent sent inside to get information out of Wanda. But these don't make sense either. Because why would they specifically cast Evan Peters to play those roles? A nod to the fans? No, too cheap. A clever cameo? No, it wouldn't be clever, it would be scummy.

Btw (scientifically) a cell can be rewritten if the gene is edited. The genes are like templates of what cells should be created and where inside our bodies. If cells are ""re-written"" this is due to gene edition/manipulation/mutation (in MCU case - the X gene)"

mccall11,1613132500.0,"Theories:

• ""Yo-Magic, The Snack for Survivors"" was foreshadowing that when the Hex ends every Westview resident will either be dead or a mutant. There's likely to be a big battle in the final episode, maybe this is how many of them are killed? Or Wanda just goes ham lol

• Quicksilver is Fox's Peter and he was sent to Westview to try and get through to Wanda. Whoever sent him is protecting him from Wanda's mind control- He's just playing along like Pietro and like a sitcom character.

He has no personal connection to Wanda or Vision. He just shows up because...he's smart and has a movie coming. 

Riri Williams also has her own show coming. Why not her?!

Blue Marvel is an Aerospace Engineer and has a connection to Monica. Why not him?!

Why would she want that ? I don't know, but as we saw in this episode (and as she said it in the previous) Wanda can control the whole town by herself, so can you imagine with all this new area to cover ?

Wanda says that before everything happened, she felt like she was completely hopeless and alone, just like the kid in the commercial. Then the “shark” shows up and offers the kid a way out. The kid is at first hopeful about what’s being offered, but as he occupies himself with trying to enjoy the Yo magic he’s been given, he slowly wastes away, because in the end it wasn’t a solution, it was simply a distraction."

Wanda facing her grief and Strange facing the pain which has been a recurring part of his character so far. Maybe if he's in Strange 2 we'll get a scene where Nightmare tortures Strange about how he let Tony die and took Morgan's father from her when he should've found another way.

byakko,1613133720.0,"Marvel (like Marvel-comics in general) have always waffled over Vision’s...contribution...to the twin’s birth. It’s worth mentioning that MCU-Vision is actually partially biological - his body was made in the bio 3D printing machine that was originally used to grow/print new skin or organs for grafting and transplants (Barton got a skin graft form it in *Age of Ultron*).

Which means while we don’t know who contributed the genetic base, technically MCU-Vision could have working swimmers is all I’m saying. At any rate it’s a better chance than in the comics.

But the comics have also discussed the issue of who counts as the twin boys’ father for some time now. I’m going to summarise some points made from the reincarnated twins onwards, not the originals because frankly they’re not the ones being adapted in MCU:

1) In *Children’s Crusade*, Billy pointed out that he had read up about their origins as much as he could find, and knew about the Mephisto angle. So at that point he and Tommy talked with Master Pandemonium about how they didn’t know either who was their spiritual ‘father’. Master Pandemonium (who caused the original crisis and absorption of the original twins) literally tells them to not think about it too hard and to accept their presence in the world now.

2) In *Children’s Crusade*, it was originally established that the reincarnated boys had different biological parents and that the current families they were with were the ones that they were biologically born into. At some point this has been retconned too I think (their wikis state both were *adopted* by their respective foster families). How their reincarnation actually took place now and whether they even have a real bio family is up in the air; both now assume Wanda as close to ‘bio-mom’ as possible, and Vision as their ‘bio-dad’.

3) At some point, I’m not sure exactly which issues onwards, Marvel writers seem to have double downed on how Vision is their father, because it was both his and Wanda’s desire for the twins to be born. Billy has introduced himself as (paraphrasing here) “the son of a witch and an Android. Their wish made real” Since Wanda is no longer technically the biological mother of Billy and Tommy, Vision has equal ‘role’ in relation to the reincarnated boys.

The twins have also introduced themselves as ‘half-robot sorta’ to their ‘aunt’ Nadia Pym (another daughter of Hank Pym in the comics).

So in general, currently in comics, the twin boys see Vision as their father in same way as Wanda being their mother. Without him, they wouldn’t exist as how they are currently.

Also an extra thing, during the *Secret Wars* event, one version of the original Android Human Torch (whose body was the original base for Vision in the comics) was able to have children with a human woman so there’s that."

ghqwertt,1613133735.0,"Not in a way you'd really notice on sitcoms, though. Plus, Malcolm in the Middle mostly came after 9/11.

Scrolling through this [top 100](https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/the-100-best-tv-sitcoms-of-all-time/#21-scrubs) list, probably the most influential post-9/11 sitcoms were Scrubs and Arrested Development. And they're pretty similar to Malcolm in the Middle in terms of style and tone: single-camera, no laugh track, light background music, lots of cutaway gags. It's definitely a style that became the fashion by the mid-2000s—see also 30 Rock, Community, CYE, Sunny, etc.

IMO, a 90s episode would have aped the likes of Seinfeld, Friends, Married with Children, or Roseanne. Still multi-camera with a laugh track, a bit more biting than earlier sitcoms."

Obnoxious22,1613134289.0,"I noticed 2 things during the intro:

Pietro appears and does the Devil Horns hand gesture. QUITE SUS. 

During that, the credits say ""Pietro Maximoff As Himself"". 

A bit redundant to specify that if he really was playing simself, cause everyone else also is playing themselves but that isnt mentioned when their names are credited."
DrYoshiyahu,1613134295.0,"Pietro in Wandavision may be one of the most complicated characters an actor could ever portray.

Worst case scenario (for Evan Peters), he's playing a unknown force inhabiting another person's body, while trying to pretend to be the very close twin of the lead character.

His character (or the character his character is pretending to be) happens to be a very well-known and beloved comic book character, who Peters has previously played in a completely different context and style, *and* who was previously played in *this* context by a different actor, whom Evan (and, technically, Evan's character) also has to try and emulate.

And this character is also simultaneously aware of the fact that they've died and been resurrected, that they have amnesia, *and* that they apparently have a different face/body. (More accurately, it may be that the character Evan is playing is aware that the character *they* are playing is an imperfect replica.)

Never mind the fact that Evans has to perfectly emulate an entirely different television show with a completely different tone and genre to the one that the show *actually* has, *and* play the character in such a way as to break that in-universe fourth wall by being *aware* of the fact that they're supposed to be playing a character in a different tone and genre.

It's like five layers deep: an actor pretending to be an unknown force pretending to be a dead superhero with amnesia based on another actor's performance, pretending (sometimes) to be a 00s sitcom character.

I can't possibly imagine how much prep work has to go into something like that. His character's bio description must be enormous."

She's at the edge of the hex, shining her lights on the boundary, for a reason. She tells Vision that it's Wanda keeping everyone hostage and he believes her. She says there's no way out and he believes her, and that's when he fully decides to leave the hex. She played him like a fiddle."
jmoneyawyeah,1613134324.0,Why did vision disintegrate when taken outside the Hex. Shouldn’t he have just turned back into a corpse? Or the Hex changes him so he’s just himself?
ksealz,1613134334.0,"I don't think she's evil, and I'm not convinced she even did all of this. I think she's been made to feel in control of something in which she's a glorified pawn. BUT even if not, I don't think she's at the point of *evil*. She's clearly done wrong here, and the way Pietro basically excused her with the whole ""ethics"" conversation is interesting, because she knows it's wrong she's just unwilling to change it. But again, I wouldn't go so far as to say evil. Grief is not an excuse for criminal acts and this level of mindfuckery and kidnapping, but still not evil imo."
a4techkeyboard,1613134336.0,"It's an adaptation, maybe they included her but it looks like Magneto just actually has a bunch of children all over the place or it was just adopted siblings or whatever. Point is, this Quicksilver might not even have a twin to remember getting fish in Sokovia with, unless it really is a reskin of the Sokovian Pietro. But I guess it might not even be any version of Pietro so X-Men movie Pietro's family doesn't really come into it as all his memories are fake."

dbslayer7,1613134537.0,So the way Pietro is acting is making the Evan Peters inclusion look more like a grand Meta Joke or red herring rather than it being multiverse stuff just yet. But we'll still need to wait and see. Also Agnes hasn't been identified and could be working for/be the big bad but she's still under Wanda's influence in some way.

Fair enough.

This is also the first time he appears in his full Avengers costume, and that's when he's at the edge of the hex.  Likely Wanda has little control over things at the edge so he was able to fully appear in his Avengers costume.  I love how also the first time we see his MCU costume is when he shifts from his comic book costume to his MCU costume.  A great touch!"
Kellerhouse,1613134696.0,AHS: 1984 is actually pretty good. So is Roanoke because it deviates from the AHS formula for every minute except the last 10 of the season.
AtlasClone,1613134701.0,"Well his body is organic in a sense. It's vibranium atoms fused with organic cells. My headcanon goes one of two ways. Either he's kind of like Data from Star Trek and his breathing serves some alternate purpose like a cooling system or something.

That Agnes scene makes me think this event is actually the catalyst that turns her into Agatha Harkness instead of her being a witch from the get go.

Straight people already get 99.9% of all other roles, let the LGBT community have something. 

 Billy's entire story revolves around him and his relationship to his mother and to Hulkling. The character is explicitly written to be gay, let someone from the LGBT community play it.

I think characters that are explicitly written to be gay should be always played by actors from those communities.

TessiSue,1613135212.0,"I think she either got weak (which is contraticted by the ending of E6) or loses focus. When asked by Vision she tells him it would theoretically take a lot of power and headspace to make everyone go to work or to the dentist.

She told Tommy and Billy not to go past Ellis Avenue. Why would she let them go that far if she knew the poeple even nearer to her don't 'function' anymore?

She resets the whole city everyday. But her influence on the people outside seems to not be enough to have them live healthy lives anymore.

Newer sitcoms often revolve around the living space and maybe the office or a bar. Think How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory or Two and a Half Men. I think Wanda might have to do what's right and reduce the sets and also the amount of extras because she simply cannot uphold this and hurts a lot of innocent people.

In a world like the MCU normal diseases simply shouldn't exist anymore. There's people with an IQ of round about a billion, it's actually just not realistic for that to still exist. Now, super diseases like space cancer or some crazy shit? Definitely. A flu pandemic? Shuri would probably just have to invest like 1g of Vibranium to immediately heal the entire world.

Second was that Pietro doesn't remember his death as he didn't get shot like a chump in the streets for nothing. Pietro purposely sacrificed himself to save two people.

Then there's 9 months of post production, for a total production time of 14 months.  Then there's 2 years before a ""late 2023"" targeted release date for FF, which is more than enough time for Watts to take a nice long vacation and still complete the film even if it takes twice as long to produce as Homecoming took.

Sw6roj,1613135656.0,"OK, is it too early for theories? I think it's obvious that that's not Pietro. He knew that the Vision died even though that happened after he was already dead. Wanda says that she remembered their past differently (though that was a cutaway, and may not have been intended as canon). Then when she asks him about their past, instead of answering he asks her if she's testing him (which she totally was). Then he asks how she's doing it which is just suspicious no matter what. IT'S MEPHISTO! OK, now that I've got that out of my way, on to my real theory. SWORD knew that she knew about her brother because that's what got Monica ejected from the Hex. Later they sent in an 80's drone because it wouldn't be effected by the Hex. What if they tried something similar, but instead tried to direct Wanda's transformation in a certain direction? Like say if they dressed a SWORD agent like Wanda's dead brother, pushed him through the barrier, and just let Wanda's magic do the rest?"
StarksGhost,1613135667.0,"A moment in E4 is a big clue I think.  When Wanda emerges to confront SWORD, Monica tells Wanda that she, Wanda, subconsciously sensed her, Monica, and forcibly sucked her in.  It's conceivable that when Wanda transformed the field into the stronger red glowy thing, that she could subconsciously sense Quicksilver from across the multiverse and sucked him in too.

It happened to be a different version, so the whole situation is operating on multiple levels.  Meta and super-meta."

3-Personally seemed like Mephisto was a metaphor to the shark. I mean if we're going off of ""One More Day"" and any rendition of Ghost Rider, making deals with him in exhange for something with a faustian price is pretty much his character. Wanda making a deal with the devil in exchange for the perfect life is pretty much the theory i'm sticking by at this point."

If The Vision is his full name, that implies “The” is his first name and “Vision” is his surname.

Women commonly take the last name of their husband when they get married.

Which means the show’s name is Wanda’s full name. 

Wanda Vision."

It would be analogous to expect a 25 years old to understand a late 70's popular sci-fi movie references that never got a reboot or franchise extension recently like The Invasion of the Body Snatchers or something like that.

I watched the end of Endgame again recently and Wanda there is 100% comfortable with the fact that Vision is dead and has moved on.

ketlourd,1613136689.0,What he said about the blip makes sense tho. Like they really have been put through hell by supernatural people for the past several years. I understand his hatred for people like Wanda who does whatever they please leaving those who are powerless as collateral damage.

YoBuckStopsHere,1613136704.0,"It's not a prison, getting into the camp would be harder than leaving."
yonatan8070,1613136711.0,"Or like it is in games, where the game doesn't simulate NPCs that aren't in the player's vicinity to save on memory and system resources. Maybe Wanda just doesn't have the ability to ""run"" everyone at full mental capacity at once"
tomhas10,1613136718.0,"I honestly thought the commercial was foreshadowing. When Vision was being torn apart, I expected the kids to suddenly start doing the same thing."
nerhe,1613136721.0,"My theory: They’re all *her* memories. That’s why there’s the gap, bc they didn’t exist for a time. Vision only has memories from then on, bc she doesn’t want him to know that he died."
cmcsed9,1613136725.0,I think it was to fit the era. Closing credits at this point were just fade to black.
billyinforsey,1613136742.0,"True, but if Agnes is Agatha then she probably is not going to react the same as a normal person. She probably doesn’t have family if she is a witch from Salem."
droden,1613136742.0,black widow traded her soul for the soul stone. its not the same thing.
MahoganyTownXD,1613136744.0,"I only learned yesterday that ATJ was Kick-Ass, so when I heard that I lit up."
RoboNinjaPirate,1613136754.0,"Reed Richards is the obvious first guess if you just think about Marvel Characters in space, but Adam Brashear makes a lot of sense for anyone who knows Monica's character in the comics well."
enchantrem,1613136762.0,There's a lot of futility in this episode.  The gang getting iced out of SWORD's operation.  Monica's dire lab results.  Trying and failing to meet Monica's contact.  Darcy handcuffed to the jeep.
nerhe,1613136773.0,What rumors???
Bruce_Bruce,1613136777.0,"Lol, that's awesome, I didn't know that!"
LupusNoxFleuret,1613136778.0,"I think it's simpler than that.

The Parent Trap: movie about twins portrayed by a single actress.

The Incredibles: movie about a family with superpowers."
gcolquhoun,1613136786.0,"This is where we’re called on to use our imagination. They will fill in more blanks as stories come, but we don’t need every detail spelled out to imagine how devastating it would be if half of life vanished."
ItsTheCrashMan,1613136793.0,"Y'all noticed how Agnes didn't react to being released from Wanda's control as how Monica and Norm described it? If anything, her being released implies she definitely knows more than what's being shown."
thedeathzone,1613136799.0,"how is the story pace slow or not much going on? seriously don't get this complaint. In the past two episodes we've had the introduction of Tommy and Billy (Speed and Wiccan), Wanda confronting SWORD outside of Westview, Evan Peters as Pietro, the kids getting their powers, Vision investigating and almost being ripped apart, Wanda expanding the bubble and neutering SWORD.

Do you not understand the concept of a mystery or a TV show? Why would you be getting closure in the middle of the series? It's called *closure* for a reason."
pixtini,1613136801.0,"And Age of Ultron she screwed with everyone and threw Vision into the earth, like this is nothing new but still cool as heck."
enchantrem,1613136805.0,"I'm guessing Hayward's been on team ""these things aren't people they're either weapons to use or threats to be put down"" for his whole career.  Operation Cataract seems like a SWORD program to weaponize the Vision's body."

solipsistrealist,1613136861.0,"With the expansion of the Hex, im thinking this is how the MCU gets mutants because of the molecular change. Yea, I know we have Puerto so that’s an alternative to getting the X-Men, but if he’s from a different reality, this could be the way that mutants happen in this universe."
TTV_DrCrozz,1613136865.0,Damn is that really back to back? Like within a couple weeks of each?
enchantrem,1613136868.0,Mephisto started being a random mid-level SWORD bureaucrat years ago to fuck with Wanda after the Snaps?  I give your theory three out of ten brains.
mknsky,1613136878.0,Yeah Vision was passive aggressive as fuck this episode and I was entirely here for it.
ddeka777,1613136878.0,">Btw I don't really think Peter's death did much for Hawkeye's character arc. Besides caring about Wanda a bit more than the others

He named his youngest son after Pietro (and Natasha - his name is Nathaniel Pietro Barton). And I think Clint will be more attached to this child than his other kids, because he's named after two headmasters of Hogw- ahem, I'm sorry. He's named after the two Avengers who sacrificed themselves to let him live."
HailToTheKingslayer,1613136879.0,Saw a comment that said cataracts can cause double vision. So is SWORD working on a Vision clone or something?
StarksGhost,1613136886.0,"I think it's just Monica who will be altered to any degree worth commenting on.  She went through the force field twice, going in and coming out.  She's about to go in again it looks like.  That's 3 events which will seal her fate to gain the powers to become Photon.

No other character will have that much exposure."
Padre_Xeno,1613136890.0,Powers like Sage from X-Men would be cool. Or since she was shackled by the circus she could be a lioness lady?
LockjawTheOgre,1613136890.0,"My head-canon on this is that she's been suspicious for a while, and she's taken some preliminary steps just-in-case."
eager_wayfarer,1613136890.0,Yeah but throughout all the movies Wanda has always spoken in a foreign accent
Zouthpaw,1613136895.0,"Don't think so, she can't even wipe the tears falling from her eyes."
UnluckyConstruction3,1613136897.0,that is just a nitpick though in real life you will have to wait for 3 to 4 days for any real results... and they have wrap these episodes quickly plus stark is able to do it soo macrohard must be helping the gov to spy on us

TheRealExBattousai,1613136945.0,"I know, right!?"
cmcsed9,1613136946.0,"She’s faking it. She’s trying to pit Wanda and Vision against each other. She did it last episode, too."
hb1290,1613136946.0,If anything Darcy’s more likely to be Dazzler. Disney’s not going to risk being accused of whitewashing
SnitGTS,1613136948.0,"Well, they weren’t taking him apart just for fun."
DraftDraw,1613136949.0,I think it's going to be Blue Marvel. IIRC he's an aerospace engineer in the comics and had a relationship with Spectrum (Monica)
mrazgrass,1613136958.0,"Hmm, human music... I like it."
ddeka777,1613136963.0,Oh you'll see him alright - stay tuned for the remaining episodes.
bellowingbullfinches,1613136964.0,They only filmed part of the first episode in front of a live studio audience. Obviously it’s not even possible with the single-camera format of the later episodes.
solipsistrealist,1613136965.0,I didn’t notice it was his actual costume until Wiccan left the house. It looked just something a child would wear on a normal day playing dress up. So subtle.
HyperCookieLord,1613136968.0,"I thought it was very clever, cause Darcy is saying ""Oh fuck"", but the Hex is this sterile, happy, sitcom world, so it censors her as she's entering it"
Demileto,1613136972.0,"Nah, sitcom references are catching up with modern days, I don't see them keeping that angle for more than the next episode, especially considering how much of what was going on was revealed to Vision in this one."
Strange_Temperature,1613136980.0,"Rewatched to take note of a small detail: when Wanda freezes all of Westview (not just people but even **props**), her kids aren't affected. Yet another example of the fact she can't control them.

I had a feeling when they mentioned Monica's DNA being rewritten by the hex that it'd be used to introduce the X-Men into the MCU, and that perhaps Wanda would expand the hex to cover the world. The fact she's expanded it so considerably this episode suggests to me that perhaps this might happen.

I have a feeling the hex (or the DNA morphing effect of the hex) will expand to possibly cover the entire country or even planet, even if only briefly."
TheLoveofDoge,1613136980.0,"She’s definitely going to be running a cupcake shop/bakery, isn’t she?"
effdot,1613136987.0,"So, wow! Also, Hayward really dislikes superheroes. After the latest trailers for Falcon and the Winter Soldier, that aligns him with Baron Zemo."
Scops,1613136991.0,"I think if Dottie turns out to be the big bad, then it will be revealed that said big bad was taking multiple forms.  We barely saw Dottie outside of episode two, so I think she's just been too under the radar for it to be a satisfying twist.

Now, if it turned out that Dottie and Pietro were forms taken by the same entity..."
DoubleStrength,1613136991.0,"That's okay, by all means please roll your eyes at me some more."
jagemir,1613137003.0,I am speed
wgolding,1613137004.0,"""What if it's all illusion, sit back and enjoy the show!""

Wow. Characters aren't hiding their powers, and the opening themes aren't even hiding the mystery anymore."
chedeng,1613137005.0,holy shit
archiminos,1613137008.0,That wouldn't work because it would mean 50% of people are mutants when they need to be a minority.
UnluckyConstruction3,1613137016.0,that would actually be hilarious
AmNotACactus,1613137020.0,"I know. But in her pocket universe she’s emulating American sitcoms, hence why there’s only an accent when she steps outside the bubble"
jansknow,1613137027.0,Anyone else catch the opening theme’s lyrics? “Don’t try to fight the *chaos*...” hmmmm
Throwaway_931782,1613137039.0,"But Wanda said she didn't do that, in the previous episode. She was really surprised to see him there."
Zouthpaw,1613137043.0,"Yeah, i thought he was really trying to provoke Wanda."
mknsky,1613137045.0,That “sassy best friend” comment had me ready to deck him. Insulting to a white AND black lady at the same time takes effort.
jbecks79,1613137051.0,Soul Stone required sacrifice... and caused two major deaths in the MCU.  And it was guarded by umm Red Skull.  Yeah agree nothing about that commercial was anything like that...
PhanThief95,1613137052.0,Even Iron Fist wears his signature white outfit in his second season.
DraftDraw,1613137063.0,"It also makes sense because it's a fake ""Dream"" reality but it's a ruse by ""Nightmare""

Plus unfortunately I don't think they'll ever adapt Mephisto in the MCU because China censors Satan and demonic figures in movies and I doubt Disney/MS would risk losing their biggest audience"
Im_batman_2500,1613137063.0,So who do u think he is?
mrazgrass,1613137072.0,bonk
raees88,1613137080.0,Who they are referencing when the say one with wierd skin in the orphanage?
Luck1492,1613137080.0,"Ok so Agnes is definitely not like the rest. She’s either faking it (cause she could move after on her own) or she’s slightly more aware of what’s going on. How the fuck does Pietro know about Vision’s death? Something’s suspicious there. And also why does he have self-awareness about the Hex?

This episode created so many more questions than answers."
shartheheretic,1613137081.0,"And Strange could have pulled him from the ""FOX universe"" so it could be the XMen Quicksilver."
twotonekevin,1613137087.0,"That is a good point but the jury is still out for me. You brought me over quite a bit though. I feel like I would just need one more bit of evidence before I totally subscribe. 

I admit, I may be giving the general population too much credit in thinking that understanding references from those movies, with them being pretty monumental films, would still be common without a refresher like you said."
DarkRainbow24,1613137092.0,Jesus the whole universe? That would mean she would take controll about all life that exist. It sounds like a Avengers level threat on the same level like the snap. Even now she is OP as hell I dont know if they make a mistake with that because it will become harder to make her not one shot the villians in the future.

cmcsed9,1613137121.0,I think it’s about Wanda and Pietro being orphans and then Hydra experiments. Remember they’re the only ones who survived the experiments and I think they’re implying that Wanda and Pietro already had their powers before the experiments.
Scops,1613137124.0,Sassy best friend who is ready to scrap!  I was pleasantly surprised when he showed no hesitation in taking on those SWORD agents.  I think Scott Lang rubbed off on him a bit.

HA! Nice!"
MHPengwingz,1613137156.0,Darcy said that Monica's cells are changing after being there...so everyone in this town probably changed and definitely Agnes. Is this how they are introducing mutants into MCU?
solipsistrealist,1613137160.0,"That’s what I’m thinking. Especially if Wanda expanded the Hex the way she did. If the Hex is warped away and has to retract, you have 3,000+ people whose molecules will change along with it."
TranscendentalBeard,1613137170.0,"Am I crazy, or did the guard on the left of the screen when Jimmy and Monica were leaving in the Humvee look like Maria Hill?"
MarvelAndColts,1613137170.0,With the full house vibes of episode 5 I think we are gauging this wrong. I don’t think it is decades but more of a 15 year culmination of sitcoms.
meththemadman,1613137176.0,Sure. Works for me.
LupusNoxFleuret,1613137183.0,"For those who don't know, The Parent Trap (1998) is a movie about twins, but the catch is that it was filmed with only one actress portraying both roles, i.e giving us the illusion that there were twins.

It's available on Disney+ and still holds up as one of my favorite family movies ever (and if you like sitcoms you'll probably love this too)."
twec21,1613137191.0,Well I no longer think Agnes is involved in keeping them there.
mightysleigher,1613137191.0,"I don't think anyone is asleep. More of a nod to the character, Nightmare, I suspect. And I believe they're rumored to be the villain for Dr. Strange 2."

Rhonn_Dickpickle,1613137202.0,"So this is just Marvel Studios version of House of M, right?"
VaultBoy42,1613137206.0,"I think this is how we get Photon, and also all the mutants. I’m starting to think Wanda will eventually have some sort of power explosion and that’ll expose enough people that it causes some mutations. And everyone in the town is already at risk of mutating. 

I also have a theory that it might most affect people who were snapped and also exposed to the hex. Just that amount of messing with people is bound to cause issues."
Csantana,1613137206.0,Made me think of Drake and josh and also Life with Derek in a way?
Simontsen6,1613137212.0,I dont think she would. She would probably only recognise Hayward and Monica

enchantrem,1613137237.0,"Not sure if anybody else caught this but in episode 1 Wanda answers the phone ""Vision Residence"" as if her name is Mrs. Vision, but Billy and Tommy are credited in the beginning of this episode as ""Billy Maximoff"" and ""Tommy Maximoff"""
ToqKaizogou,1613137240.0,I understood that reference.
solipsistrealist,1613137244.0,"Seeing Vision die for a 3rd time, even slower than the first 2 times is gut wrenching. I can’t handle a 4th but I know it’s coming."
gcolquhoun,1613137251.0,"They really are playing up how nasty he is. It’s tempting to assume he’s some fancy big bad, but in reality (and comics) a lot of “villains” are exactly like this... in a position of authority with a bad attitude, perhaps with a side of selfishness and hunger for power. It will take all types of antagonists to keep a whole cinematic universe afloat. All I can say with certainty is the actor and writers are doing a tremendous job at making me want to see him punched in the face super hard. I call it a success!"

MegaUploadisBack,1613137309.0,Some people are confused because of the theater displaying The parent trap (1998) and The Incredibles (2004). Based on that and the episode itself is how they communicate this episode is referencing the 90's and early 00's.
DeadSweetHenrietta,1613137309.0,Mel Histo
Radulno,1613137310.0,"Yeah but there's also a good amount of pre-production before start of shooting (especially for the first movie of the superheroes (for a sequel some stuff is already developed so that can be faster). We don't know how much it's done but considering the director is occupied elsewhere, I'm guessing not a lot has been done yet.

IMO 2024 seems more likely for FF, especially since the pandemic delays might not even be over."
AdriZF,1613137316.0,"I think director Hayward is pretty boring for now and I really hope the series doesn’t end with Westview becoming unstable and it’s about to explode or something.  But other than those small nitpicks I liked this episode a lot! Costumes were great, Billy and Tommy discovering their powers were amazing I kinda hope they make it out and become members of the young avengers. I think there’s a good chance we see how people become assimilated into westview next episode."
AmbushIntheDark,1613137320.0,Yeah that was intentional [for sure](http://cdn.funnyisms.com/79606c8a-6f89-4576-8e96-a47d99e17ac8.jpg)

ctg9101,1613137326.0,Probably not. But I think the contact is major character.
Beingabumner,1613137329.0,"But does that fit the metaphor? Wanda('s magic) is the Yo' Magic and the townspeople are the starving kid. But people don't need magic to live. If anything, her magic is killing them (preventing them from taking care of themselves).

If we go with Yo' Magic is Wanda's Magic, it's more likely to do with Vision and maybe Pietro. It seems like Vision only exists or is alive inside the Hex, needing Wanda's magic to live, fitting the metaphor slightly better.

*But*, in the commercial the kid can't open the box and starves, which is the reverse of what happens to Vision: he is getting 'fed' by Wanda's magic and decides not to 'eat' by leaving.

I think the visual of the kid being unable to open the box is an important detail, but I can't directly link it to something we've seen."

Left4DayZ1,1613137439.0,"I don’t think the Vision we’re seeing is Vision’s reanimated corpse. I think Wanda failed at bringing him back, and whomever is behind this whole thing plucked a Vision from another timeline (or created one through the same method) and placed him here, to make her think she’d brought him back even though she seems to be aware that she can’t revert death. 

Either that, or that wasn’t really Wanda who stole Vision’s corpse in the first place, and whomever did either rebuilt him or studied him so they could make another in a different timeline. WHY they’d bring him here remains a question I can’t answer. Just to fuck with Wanda I guess? Push her out of her mind so she becomes a weapon?

I think Wanda seeing dead vision was just.. a... vision. Not that she was seeing through a facade, but more like her trauma appearing through the cracks of her make believe world."

Wakanda has much greater healthcare technology than the rest of the world, and one of the central themes of *Black Panther* was whether they should share that technology. T’Challa eventually decided they should, but obviously those plans were halted by the Snap.

crazymar1000,1613137936.0,"Some thoughts on Agnes (and why she is 100% going to be revealed as a villain, probably next week to allow time to set up the finale)

1) Why could she talk that far away from the epicentre while other residents just kinda stand there brainless. The residents that far out aren't even really doing anything. It's like they've been put into the right places by Wanda and then just left to stand there. They don't seem to have any autonamy whatsoever. Meanwhile Agnes is free to communciate with Vision and also somehow travel to that location (we don't see any other residents travel that far away from where they're *supposed* to be. I've seen some people say that because she's a 'main character' from Wanda's POV she remains 'in character' longer despite being far away, but this actually makes less sense when you consider it in the context of my next point....  

&nbsp; 

2) How did Agnes even get there? We know from her own dialogue that 'Wanda doesn't even let them think about leaving' so how is she so far out? If Wanda has *more* influence over Agnes (because she's a main character) then it makes it even less likely that Agnes would just wander that far out. Wanda certainly didn't control her and make her go there (as that would risk Vision finding her and trying to leave) so it must have been done by Agnes' own free will. 

&nbsp;

3) Why is she there? She doesn't seem to be trying to leave and as soon as she's finished talking to Vision she turns around and goes back towards town. It's not like he freed her and then she made a mad dash for the barrier. 'Mind controlled' Agnes headed to that location and then 'Mind controlled' Agnes turned around and drove back. What was the purpose of tha drive. Most likely it was to draw Vision out there, 'Mind controlled' Agnes was literally shining her headlights on the barrier of The Hex, hardly subtle. 

&nbsp;

4) Think about this, if you were just a normal Westview resident (or even some kind of operative like Monica) and you were mind controlled for god knows how long what would your first reaction be upon being freed temporarily? Probably like Norm last week where he panicked and starting talking about his family. 

Agnes has no such reaction, instead reminding Vision that he's an Avenger (reminding him of the *real* world), reminding him that he's dead (more reality checks), encouraging him to leave (""how? no one leaves""), then just maniacally starts laughing. Hardly normal behaviour for a normal resident of the town who has just been free from mind control."

enchantrem,1613137957.0,"> Though, this episode we learn that she is under Wanda's control when vision catches her parked in the car.

Is that what we learned?  Here's what I learned:

* Agnes was in her car facing out of town

* She appeared to be confused until Vision touched her

* After Vision touched her she gasps and dramatically recoils and then name drops the Avengers and tells Vision he's dead

* Vision touches her again and she stops freaking out about his death and she heads back into town

bellowingbullfinches,1613137971.0,"I haven’t seen the Fox movies, but the MCU has literally thousands of things to nitpick if you really want to. See, for instance, every scene involving Cap’s shield. Or how Iron Man would’ve died on impact dozens of times. Or all the falls that should’ve seriously injured normal humans like Lang or Hawkeye.

Obviously if you didn’t like the scene, you didn’t like it. But there’s no reason to nitpick it to justify your opinion. And there’s also no reason to pretend that the MCU is completely realistic just because you like the MCU. Nitpicking in general is pointless. Just enjoy what you like and let others do the same."

MawsonAntarctica,1613138138.0,"And the fact that she can expand the red town into almost a county (and then a state, country etc) is proof enough that she's too dangerous. He had to take a shot.

Hamadi9,1613138138.0,Pietro was gaslighting Wanda. He wants her to believe that she is doing all of this. He said his purpose is to cause more grief.  He showed up when Vision was trying to get through to Wanda to cause a distraction. He is not from FOX's universe he was created by whoever wants Wanda to stay in the false reality.
CrimsonKingXIII,1613138139.0,"So Vision can't live outside the barrier at least not yet or it could be that maybe no one can force their way out without dying, they might have to be let out by Wanda or kicked out by her like she did to Monica. Speaking of Monica, I wonder if because she has passed into and out of the barrier if that means she might get powers. I'm assuming that's why they made a point to bring up Monica's test results this episode."

I think the missing person of interest is a skrull that is a high tech genius that captures people in web sitcoms. He was experimenting  in west view when Agent Wan lost him. Before we could get to the scene wanda hand already arrives with vision. Mojo decides to use Wanda's powers to enhance the scope of his project. Hes probably more of a grey villain.  But now, this have gotten out of control. Mojo is the one controlling everyone, not Wanda. Shes just a puppet. Finally the conclusion will be vision and wanda fighting and almost obliterating westview but before they can Wiccan will destroy the forcefeild and reveal that Wanda and vision were pawns. Wiccan also has the ability to reverse illusions. Thia is setting up Speed and Wiccan to help doctor strange in the multiverse of madness. Its uncertain if wanda and Vision will survive this. They may have to sacrifice themselves fo their new children.

DaveInLondon89,1613138286.0,"Wanda is using Westview to create the perfect Afterlife.

#####It's **The Good Place.**

Or at least, what Wanda's view of the perfect reality will be. **She's running through sitcom scenarios like beta versions** of a video game. In each iteration she's bringing in more characters, making the world a little more complex, and a bit more realistic - the same way sitcoms have evolved in real life. Taking the best part from each decade and using it to build the best version of the idyllic suburban life that she can. 

And she's doing this **for the children**. More specifically, the children who perished in the 'hell' after The Blip. The ones who were abandoned and forgotten about. Who died alone and afraid. It's something Wanda emphasises deeply with. We know she, or *someone* can **bring the dead back to 'life'.** We know because they're different from the other residents of Westview. Like Agnes, Herb, Vision and now Pietro, they retain *some* self-awareness. 

It's **also going to be for the children who didn't die**, but were otherwise traumatised beyond compare. We see Billy and Tommy able to age themselves up, but explicitly stated by them to be in **5 year increments - the same length as The Blip**. And if they can move age forward, they can age backwards too, with no reason to think they aren't able to exercise that power on others. 

Therefore I think Wandavision intended purpose is to **give those children and their families an afterlife where they can be happy** - surrounded by family, with no worries and no trauma. Where there's no loss and more importantly - **no memory of what came before.** Both for the children who died in it's aftermath and the one's who survived - to be aged back to that day and mindwiped along with their family to live in Westview. Indeed Pietro remarks on how much thought she's put into it - families are kept together, personalities are based on what's underneath and they've all got better jobs. 

But we know by now that there is something or someone **pulling the strings behind the scenes**. Wanda doesn't know *how* she created Westview. Norm in his lucidity only says **'you have to stop HER**, omitting Wanda's name. Another Witch in the picture perhaps. More tellingly it explains how Pietro returns - Vision had a body from which she could work from. Pietro did not. And that's why whoever bought him back to life had to recast him with what she thought Quicksilver looked like, and the only source of that for her is X-men movies. We also learnt this episode **Sentient Weapon** Observation and Research Division is hiding something away. Something that has to come into play, And know they were experimenting on Vision's body. It's not too much of a stretch to consider the possibility they were attempting to create someone with similar powers to Wanda's too. **Maybe Dottie's chants of 'For The Children'  mean more than a simple refrain** from a PTA head. She does bleed red, after all. 

Dottie or whoever this hidden villain is the reason for the resurrections, and it's a lot darker. I think it's the same reason Billy and Tommy exist, and why Vision is there at all is not just to keep Wanda happy and content in her role as a creator, but something far worse. We know **Wanda's power scales with the amount of trauma she experiences.** We saw her disintegrate everything around her when she lost Pietro for the first time. We saw her single-handedly hold Thanos at bay in Infinity War, and almost kill him in Endgame with the loss of Vision. Vision, Billy, Tommy and Pietro aren't characters in her sitcom - **they're sacrificial lambs** to power the ultimate burst of Scarlet Witch's magic. Today's episode was foreshadowing of just what that could be. **Westview will grow to cover the whole planet** when they're sacrificed. A new reality for the dead, the traumatised and the forgotten, **for the children** - at the expense of trapping the people in the whole world in the same shackles affecting the living residents of Westview now. 

#tl;dr  Wanda is using Westview to create a perfect reality for the children traumatised by The Blip. And then someone is going to use Wanda to bring Westview the children who were lost in The Blip... and then to the whole world.

mielove,1613138391.0,"A good portion of Hollywood actors are gay, they're just not publicly open about it. But it's an open secret, and many are open to their families and friends even though they may have media girlfriends/boyfriends. Bearding is a huge industry in Hollywood.

Point is, this whole idea that actors should be forced out of the closet in order to play gay roles is ludicrous. The world is a dangerous place for LGB+ people, these actors have every reason to not air their sexuality publicly. Gay people play straight characters all the time, some of the most well-known ""ladies men"" of Hollywood are gay or bi even if you've never realised it.

It's why no one in the industry truly cares about this, because they know that this whole spiel of ""gay people don't get straight roles so straight people shouldn't be allowed to play gay people"" is a stupid narrative based on false assumptions. It's just not true, which is why no one outside of social media truly cares when ""straight"" (as the audience knows it) actors play gay roles."

So, IMO the commercials all directly reference each of the movies Wanda’s appeared in (apart from the first being her backstory). The Hydra Soak one threw me, but after last week they’re just too on the nose to be anything else now. Don’t get me wrong I think they all have multiple meanings within the context of the show, but thematically each is tied to a movie:

Ep 1 - The Toaster - Backstory - Stark missile

Ep 2 - Strucker Watch - Captain America: Winter Soldier (post credit scene) - Strucker experimenting on Wanda.

Ep 3 - Hydra Soak - Avengers: Age of Ultron - hydra brainwashing her to fight the Avengers (I think the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. soap reference is just a nice Easter egg)

Ep 5 - Lagos Paper Towels - Captain America: Civil War - Lagos incident where she caused dozens of civilian casualties.

Ep 6 - Yo-magic - Avengers: Infinity War - not surviving the snap (the snack for survivors) and her magic not saving Vision or stopping Thanos.

Ep 7 - should reference Endgame. And being the last of the “sit-com episodes” it’ll probably be the last commercial so it would make sense."

_What_am_i_,1613138519.0,Him or Reed are the best bets
Hungrypeach44,1613138534.0,"I mean at this point I kinda agree.

The show has set up 2 main options so far in regard to what’s happening. 

The first is that Wanda is controlling everything, in which case she’s a bad guy, I mean the people  are in pain as confirmed by Vision which Wanda is aware of, and she’s been told to stop by Vision and Sword. So if she’s in control and ignoring them then she’s a bad guy.

The second is that someone else created the bubble and is manipulating Wanda. Even with this idea though Wanda still doesn’t come off as good. Even if she’s not controlling the town she still knows that people are being controlled and are in pain and has made no effort to put an end to it and is seemingly fine living in it. In which case less of a bad guy but still bad. 

At this point the only Way Wanda comes out of this show good is if she’s being manipulated a lot more than we expect, like fully manipulated. 

I mean when you combine that with Wanda releasing the Hulk on a city in Age of Ultron, then she has arguably harmed and done more villainous acts than some of the actual villains in the MCU. 

Sure she’d be a sympathetic Villain, but still a villain. 

Unless she’s being completely manipulated Wanda needs to face some actual consequences at the end of this show or Dr strange 2. I mean it’d be ridiculous if she doesn’t. 

There’s only so much a character can be redeemed for. Even House of M was retconned because Wanda was too unredeemable and they wanted her to be a hero."

That being said, it could be either. I also think its plausible that the spell could have been pulling him back inside. In fact, maybe it’s a mix of both? He was outside the hex so he started dying and it was trying to pull him back in because he would’ve died outside it?

raahuljohn,1613138679.0,"Exactly, thats what im guessing.. practically possible!"
David__Cockerfield,1613138683.0,So Hayward is using Wanda to bring vision back from the death. Agnes is probably with Hayward.
ParcivalAurus,1613138689.0,"I feel like the commercial may actually be a big hint at what may be going on in the series. I could be going out on a limb here but there's a child stuck on an island (the hex) and then the shark comes out of the water to ""help"" them.  The shark specifically says ""eating yo'magic"" and then the child wastes away.  It could be referencing that Wanda is as stuck in the hex as anyone and that the purpose is to eat her magic by whatever actually created the hex?"

DrJoker94,1613138748.0,"If we assume the commercial breaks are STILL projecting Wanda's past traumas and difficult situations, I have a feeling the YoMagic is something we haven't seen - namely Wanda making a deal to get a power upgrade.

We have a boy on a deserted island (lonely Wanda) getting something he really wants (ability to raise Vision/power boost) from a sketchy overly-friendly shark (...Agatha Harkness?), but in the end it doesn't go as the boy wanted (typical deal-with-the-devil scenario) and is left is the (Vision's?) corpse."

icemankiller8,1613138773.0,"Best episode so far IMO probably because it’s the first episode where I really got the style of sit com because it’s from the era where I started watching some and the style was pretty accurate and the intro was great. Lots of questions still there and that’s a positive I don’t want everything to be revealed right away it’s nice having some questions that aren’t answered right away. 

That being said I hope they don’t shy away from those answers by the time the show is over. Also people were speculating Agnes was the real force behind this was that today a red herring to make us suspect her less? I mean look at how calm she was compared to the other guy who was literally yelling and screaming. Also how Pietro knows vision died when he died first if it’s actually the original one"
Dougdoesnt,1613138780.0,"Interesting things I noticed:

In the intro, Agness is in the house with the kids, and the camera pans across the back of her sweatpants where the word 'NAUGHTY' is written. 


Haywood's secret project is called 'CATARACT', cataracts is a medical condition where proteins build up on the lens of the eyeball and clouds one's VISION.

gcolquhoun,1613138832.0,"I also think the flashes of the corpse versions of her loved ones are moments where she can’t hide from the truth.

Vinu_ParanoidAndroid,1613138857.0,If you look closely at the gravestone's Wanda knocked Pietro over. One of them says  Janell  Sammelman who happens to be the  Second Unit Director for Fantastic four (2015)
Dr_Disaster,1613138862.0,I feel like people constantly forget Vision is a robot and can be changed as easily as the matter that crosses the bubble. Without the mindstone he’s just metal.
alex494,1613138867.0,"I'm always amazed at how people seen to think people jumping between entire universes is somehow the easier option given the scale and logistics of feasibly doing that, like the amount of energy you'd presumably need to breach an entire other reality must be insane. Like harder than going to another planet surely. Its not exactly trivial.

Yeah Wanda's powerful and maybe thats what's happening but she could just as easily just have some close-enough stand in acting like Pietro or with some falsified appearance since she can manipulate everything around her, and it being Evan Peters is just a shorthand for the audience that yeah, its Pietro, but not the Pietro we expect, but you've seen this guy play Pietro before so there's a visual connection that its meant to be him. Like when Kevin Conroy played an older Batman in that Crisis tv show, that doesn't mean he's literally the Arkham or BTAS Batman, its just a fun casting reference.

Basically if it turns out that is the case then sure I'll buy it but its a weird jump for that to be everyone's first response to everything considering the sheer scale involved."

Ultimately I think they just wanted to move the show forward, and knew that Malcolm still gives off a reasonable amount of 90s vibes. I noticed that the movie theatre listed both Incredibles and Parent Trap, which is a movie from each decade, and there are no coincidences in this show."
Pillsburydinosaur,1613138893.0,I wonder if we are about to get a Reed Richards appearance. I still think Victor Von Doom and/or Charles Xavier might make their debut by the end.

It’s pretty clear that Vision being alive is tied to Wanda and her magic. Once he leaves that, he starts to die, which is why the Hex tries to pull him back in.
Most likely it’s a bit of both. He’s dying because he’s outside the Hex, whilst the Hex is trying and not succeeding in pulling him back in (which is why Wanda extends the Hex further)."

Agnes kind of sus manipulating vision to go outside the barrier wanting wanda to expand the barrier,Pietro acknowledges he looks different and thats sus,maybe doctor strange send xmen quicksilver to help wanda,maybe wanda is too powerful for doctor strange to handle,but doctor strange definitely gonna show up at some point since fury told spider man on far from home that doctor strange is occupied with something else"

Uncanny_Doom,1613139170.0,"To me this Pietro isn't like either ATJ's Pietro *or* Evan Peters' version. He's a bit more of an asshole than both and feels more like a conscious decision to portray a comics-accurate Quicksilver. This is also reflected by how he supports Wanda despite Wanda doing bad shit which is straight from House of M where everyone literally *thought* it was Quicksilver + Magneto's doing at first.

Evan Peters' version is more immature which is similar to his X-Men version but he's also dialed up a bit. It's hard to say honestly because ATJ Pietro didn't get that much time, even opposite Wanda. Like if you ask me, Evan Peters has more chemistry with her already than ATJ did."
bellowingbullfinches,1613139175.0,"For me it’s the opposite. I think this episode provides more evidence for Agnes being a red herring.

Aside from her name, the only real evidence that she’s more than she seems is the fact she hasn’t been ID’d by SWORD. Her fascination with Wanda bringing stuff back to life now makes sense because she literally thought she was dead. She knows what’s going on, but so does the entire town.

davidw1098,1613139350.0,"I see it as kind of a department store storage closet. The ones she doesn’t need at the moment are stashed there with random set decorations, hence why Agnes was just chilling in her car, her driving off at the end may have been she was scheduled to go to the town square and run into the boys."
myotherxdaccount,1613139353.0,"The twins say its 4pm but they both have cereal bowls. Vision also talks about cereal, or ""high fructose corn syrup."" (probably unrelated but corn syrup is how mutants powers are suppressed in Logan (2019). There is some sort cf chemical in them that suppresses mutant DNA).

Wanda is a Fortune Teller, but she doesn't know your fortune, she controls it.

Vision says Wanda is incorrigible - not able to be changed or reformed.

Vision says Halloween is a bacchanal - a wild and drunken celebration to celebrate Bacchus. Or, a celebration for a god. Mephisto might see himself as a god.

When Billy breaks the 4th wall and tells us about Wanda (sitcom style), 'Pietro' notices and looks at him oddly. This is because he has enhanced perception and he processes things much faster, which is a skill you need when you run super fast.

""I got the old XY chromosome."" 'Pietro' says he has the XY chromosome when he talks about himself as a father figure. The XY chromosome determines gender. XY is male, XX is female. But the X mention is interesting, especially considering a chromosome is similar to a gene. An X-Gene?

'Pietro's' hair looks like devil horns.

""If I see any funny business, I am going to magic you into a pickled herring."" Foreshadowing for when Vision tries to escape (funny business) and she magics the Hex to be much larger.

""Get her off my base. Now. All of them."" The ""All of them"" part is more foreshadowing to when all of the SWORD agents get off the base, as the base ceases to exist.

""Unleash hell, demon spawn,"" ""NJ is charming as hell."" Along with the devil horn hair, and all the hell references, I reckon 'Pietro' is actually Mephisto.

""What was the name of the kid who was trying to steal your boots. The one with the skin thing."" I don't know about too many people with skin problems in Marvel, but doesn't Deadpool have a skin condition?

""If I found Shangri-La, I wouldn't want to be reminded of the past either."" Shangri-La is a fictional, mystical, harmonious valley. Westview is Wanda's Shangri-La, and she doesn't want to be reminded of the past.

Looks like SWORD has been doing the AI version of what SHIELD was doing with Hydra tech in the first Avengers movie. An attempt to find a way to protect themselves from these superhuman threats.

Rb7198,1613139916.0,"Mostly the foreshadowing ones. The pickled herring thing imo is just referencing the clip they showed prior to that of them as kids trick or treating and I think it's more of a coincidence about the ""All of them"" line. Don't it was intentional foreshadowing by the writers.

Also deadpool's skin thing in the MCU specifically is from being burnt we see that in his movie. 

Think your other points might be spot on though"
enchantrem,1613139922.0,"> why is no one mentioning getting help from the other Avengers?

Post-Endgame what Avengers are there, really?  The compound was destroyed, Nat, Tony, and Steve are gone, Wanda is clearly preoccupied, Carol is clearly established as not visiting Earth too often, Thor is in space, Clint is almost definitely ignoring everything but his family for at least another few weeks, 

That leaves basically Ant-man, Spider-man, Hulk, and Black Panther (RIP), none of whom are part of any official chain of command, Bucky and Sam whose whereabouts will be revealed later this year, and Dr. Strange whose absence is definitely noteworthy.

My point is that as far as SWORD is concerned there's no reliable ""Avengers"" to call on anymore.

Though that does make me wonder where Fury, Hill, and also Rhodey are."

bellowingbullfinches,1613140038.0,"That theory doesn’t work for a lot of reasons.

First, Wanda was snapped, and the show only takes place a few weeks after Endgame. There isn’t time for her to have gotten pregnant and miscarried. And it’s simply not plausible that she was having sex with anyone days after the events of Endgame.

Second, SWORD has already identified a number of people in the town as living residents.

Third, we see that she can extend the size of the hex and add new people who she obviously hasn’t killed, such as the SWORD agents at the end of this episode.

Fourth, Westview is a real place, and your theory doesn’t account for where all the actual residents would’ve gone.

Fifth, the only two characters known to be dead have been shown dead on screen, with Vision’s gray corpse and Pietro’s corpse. No other characters have any hints towards being dead.

Sixth, there simply aren’t enough Americans who Wanda has killed to populate the town. We know at the very least that Norm’s real identity has an American accent. If he were in fact from Lagos or Sokovia, he would’ve had an accent when Vision woke him up briefly."

Maybe she acted slightly different before being woken up because she has spent so much time around wanda so she can be on 'autopilot' even when far away"

They drop some dialogue like ""he looks better in the dark"" to creep you out, but Ebony is a black cat, so they could make Ralph a black cat, hence why he looks better in the dark. She also calls him a ""tiger"", which could be a joke on it being a cat.

Fake Pietro is looking a lot more like a Mephisto stand-in after this episode and Agnes is definitely still Agatha Harkness playing dumb and helping push the narrative along.

Koala_Guru,1613140799.0,"I really did like this episode, but boy they picked an annoying sitcom format to copy lol. Then again, the 90s could be pretty annoying in general. And I’m someone who grew up in them.

The only other thing I wasn’t super sold on was how quick Hayward went from passive aggressive douchebag to full-on dick. Like, his fall into that was not even built up to really, it just happened. One episode he’s ordering them to fire on Wanda out of a misguided attempt to save the town, the next he’s suddenly insulting and firing our three main characters in the real world. Maybe I’m the only one who felt this way.

But the rest was pretty cool! I honestly had a feeling SWORD would get sucked in to the hex at some point but I thought it would be a penultimate episode kinda thing. The way Agnes acted when jolted to reality confused me as someone who was so sure she was in on it in some way, but I guess I’ll see where it goes.

It’s funny, I started this most interested in the hex storyline (and I still am, don’t get me wrong) but now I just NEED to know who Monica’s contact is. Many people are theorizing Reed Richards, and that would be awesome. I personally think it would be cool if it was Hank McCoy. I know he isn’t an engineer like Monica said her contact was, but given his history with both mutants and SWORD it feels like this would be a great place to introduce him into the story.

Based on what the characters know (prior to the arrest attempt at least), Monica is way too glass half full (hundreds/thousands of lives are being held hostage by a powerful unstable entity which could easily kill them at any time, attempted lethal force is not at all unreasonable) and Hayward is probably being too antagonistic due to being scarred by The Snap (analyse the situation a bit longer when you're dealing with a being of Wanda's power lest you turn a metaphorical nuclear meltdown into a nuclear explosion)."

PhoenixAgent003,1613140978.0,"In most hostage situations, the typical strategy is to keep the hostage taker as calm as possible and negotiate everybody’s safety. You only send in the SWAT team after you’ve gotten as many hostages out as you can/communication has completely broken down.

This is why basically every time the swat team shows up before the negotiation has finished, the protagonist cop character freaks out and says “no, wait!” and the dude in charge is like “too late, we’re going in and shooting the bastard. Some hostages dying is acceptable losses.”

Hayward jumped straight to “drone strike the bitch.” Which is not just dangerous escalation of the situation, but she did it while Wanda was standing right next to her kids—and also it was a fucking missile against a certified Thanos breaker. He may as well have been firing a nerf dart, and yet he had the audacity to be *surprised* that his pathetic excuse of an attempted triple homicide didn’t work. Like, did he think it would?"

* The recap showing ATJ-Quicksilvers death and then the shock moment of this episode.  It's like they're trying to help us notice the difference even more so.
* Maximum Malcom in the Middle.
* Sokovia Fortune Teller & Lucidore perfect covers for their comic ""accurate"" costumes.
* ""The old **X**y-chromosome""
* Jimmy Woo kicking ass and donning impenetrable MCU disguise of a baseball hat was A+
* Wanda pondering the phrase ""Kick-Ass"" is extra amusing since both Aaron Taylor-Johnson (MCU Quicksilver) and Evan Peters (Fox Quicksilver) where in it and played Kick-Ass and his rip off ""evil"" version Ass-Kicker respectively.
* Is Herb in on it too?  (“Want something changed?"") or is the illusion wearing thinner for those people who are closest to it's epicenter.
* Yo-Magic commercial
* The Incredibles and Parent Trap playing at the theater.
* Looks like Tommy/Speed and Billy/Wiccan have their powers.
* Closer to the edge of town the less “life” they have.  Reminds me of the simulation running at minimum power from Rick and Morty.  There's the most life near the primary subjects of Wanda and company and the less the further you go out.
* Visions previous statement of not knowing his life before Westview checks out with him not knowing what Avengers are.
* ""Peter"" knows what’s going on, to a crazy degree, but not totally.   He knows Wanda did this but he's not sure of the details.  I'm hanging up my ""Mephisto"" hat and putting on my ""[Nightmare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nightmare_(Marvel_Comics))"" hat.  Especially with the little horror shocks we keep getting and that Westview can very much be considered a waking nightmare.

arcaidairman,1613141482.0,"Here is my MCU Mutants theory. I'm positive that Wanda and Pietro are the first MCU mutants and that the mind stone was the catalyst for their x-gene. And now through the hexagon radiation, she is awakening the x-gen in everyone who comes in contact with her cells mutating powers. And this taking place weeks after Endgame and Far From Home being set months after the last Avengers movie, can be explained by saying that only people surrounding New Jersey were affected and they would start to carry that radiation and spread it like virus. (The way ultimate comics tackled the origins of the mutants).

Now this narative can be used in a more relatable direction for the audience who just experience a virus themselves and Marvel can call this event the **Mutant Pandemic** creating that alienating feeling between humans and mutants as we had experienced between each-other all this time because of the fear of getting infected. This will also give Marvel a chance to expend and get political and address some modern themes (as the main reason X-Men were created at the time was to fight against racism and support the racial equality) and use Magneto as leader of a Homo-Superior supremacist group making people afraid of mutants by calling them terrorists; ruining the image of mutants as a whole and this mirroring the way we see and fear emigrants today.

Was just re-watching Civil War the other day, and the way these smart assess were blaming Wanda for the Lagos incident, instead of blaming Rumlow, was some silver medal worthy mental gymnastics.

And I don't get why these pseudo government agencies(Shield-Hydra/Sword/UN Security Council, etc.) bullshit with the heroes. They are not public facing entities, they can straight up say that: they are afraid of the new status quo and the superheros, and want to control them and bring that status quo back. What's with all this ""You are putting the people in danger"" and ""Would someone please think of the people"".

dguy101,1613141955.0,"So much to dissect in this episode and will definitely be watching it again later tonight. Here's some of my observations after the first watch through:

1. Monica will most likely have her powers by the end of the season thus setting up her appearance in CM2. 
2. The fact that going through the hex makes molecular changes to your body almost confirms in my opinion that this is our first hint at mutants coming to the MCU. 
3. The Kick-Ass mention when Wanda was talking to Pietro about other Pietro was perfect. \*chefs kiss\*
4. Pietro calling the twins ""demon spawn"" is either hinting at who the villain is in the show (Mephisto) or just a nod to how they were created in the comics. 
5. Speaking of hints, Hayward saying taking out  Wanda will end this ""Nightmare"" also seems to be a hint as well so I truly have no idea who the real villain is. I feel as if both are somehow involved and one will be the main villain of WV and the other DS2."
TransBrandi,1613141959.0,"Some people are suggesting an ""explosion through time"" but it could be simpler than that:

> Mutants like Apocalypse and Wolverine already in-universe but are very rare. The ""Hex explosion"" accelerates the growth of / increases the number of people with mutations.

So basically, it's something that exists but is hidden (Apocalypse) or super secrets (Weapon X) and the Hex exploding causes it to be much more common.... or:

> The Hex just causes specific people in the MCU to get mutations, and the Multiverse of Madness causes multiple universes to collide somehow bringing us X-gene mutants from the Fox X-Men universe."

He joked about only being useful for softball, but he did get sent to look for a missing witness, and he was guarding Ant-man. He's probably one of their top agents or something. The FBI probably wanted to send in an FBI taskforce for the missing town to keep jurisdiction but trusted Woo enough when he said they probably need SWORD. And he was somehow able to communicate the plan with Monica Rambeau non-verbally when they were being escorted out so he's very sharp and perceptive and/or understood some sort of code or signal Monica used whether it was military or just... somehow reading body language and the mood or something. 

I probably overread that, I just mean it's clear his character is well-considered and thought through and not just ""oh he's a funny character, it's a wonder how he even got in the FBI."""

3. Why did the movie theater have The Incredibles on tbe marquee. Didn't it come out in like 2005?

4. Poor Vision

5.  What is going to happen to Darcy?

6.  Agnes seems to be there against her will after all.

7. So Monica is going to get her powers from repeat breaches of the illusion? That's someone else who's powers are, in some way, derived from an Infinity Stone.

8. Who was behind the camera for this episode? The boys spoke to someone behind the camera multiple times, which could just be a nod to Malcolm in the Middle, but Pietro took note of it on at least once occasion."

two2teps,1613142242.0,"I look at it like someone managing a team of people.  The manager makes a request of the team and they execute.  The manager knows the goal but not the smaller details of how it was done.

I'm also switching my Mephisto hat to a Nightmare one.  The last five years have been an absolute horror show for the entire universe.  That would certainly let Nightmare become incredibly powerful from the sheer amount of awful dreams, and as Hayward said hopelessness, that had to be happening.  Post-blip that flow would be fairly quickly tampered off to a trickle (by comparison).  

He in turn uses someone who is both very much haunted and very powerful to create this perfect waking nightmare for an entire town of people.  A 24/7 nightmare of hundreds of people spiced with some Chaos Magic.  He needs to keep Wanda happy to keep the illusion up so he steps in as Pietro, but picks the wrong one from the multiverse to mimic/inhabit."

One episode he’s ordering them to fire on Wanda out of a misguided attempt to save the town, the next he’s suddenly insulting and firing our three main characters in the real world. Maybe I’m the only one who felt this way.

I did too, but then Monica says he was ""looking for a reason to sideline us, he must be up to something"". Basically he has his own reasons for trying to kill Wanda and didn't want the trio interfering, so he was a dick on purpose.

> The way Agnes acted when jolted to reality confused me as someone who was so sure she was in on it in some way, but I guess I’ll see where it goes.

tiesforpenguins,1613142557.0,"I feel like there must be something or someone taking over her mind. The only reason I have that feeling at all is because this Pietro is Peter from the X-Men. He isn't dead, he didn't get shot up. It's not as simple as a recast.... is it? Would Marvel, who has been SO deliberate up until now, just.... recast him for a show? I don't think he will just disappear after this and he definitely didn't die in the other universe. 

I think, whoever or whatever is puppeting her used her unconscious powers to pluck Peter out of his universe and put him in the reality. Plus peep Peter having the same look of Pietro when he speeds around. That would make sense as them just taking a liberty with design.

Just my opinion, but I can't see it all being only her. Sure her unconscious mind could have done it but all of it? Without ANY outside help?"

Chronos96,1613142560.0,It won't be. The showrunner for WandaVision already confirmed there won't be anything F4 related. Blue Marvel is far more likely.
Sirdan3k,1613142561.0,I'm going to throw out my personal theory that Vision isn't actually dead-dead. That Wanda managed to use her powers to fix him but with the mindstone having been torn out he was essentially a blank slate and that that is what finally broke her down.

galaxy_dog,1613142904.0,"Yeah, how much of what we see is foreshadowing and how much is a red herring?

With Agnes as I saw what she said to Vision I thought she was a red herring. But thinking about it more, it feels kinda off. Agnes being there and saying those things to Vision pushed him into going outside, which in turn pushed Wanda into using more power.

And within the sitcom logic, why would Agnes be there? She has been the sassy neighbor who is always nearby. It's almost like she knew she'd get Vision's attention by being there."

1mrshelby,1613142942.0,"SWORD is the **Sentient Weapon Observation and Response Division.** 

Hayward has a major problem with Superheroes that has been shown over the past 2 episodes. Trying to fire a missile at Wanda in Ep4 and in Ep5 saying to Monica ''...constantly advocating on behalf of super-powered individuals''. 

He mentions that the last 5 years (the blip) was hard and it took so much just to ''keep the lights on''. He obviously blames the Avengers and Superheroes for bringing Thanos into the world, and has a deep resentment towards them.

What if SWORD and Hayward are creating Sentinels and this what is inside the computer file Darcey was trying to hack? (CATARACT File)

Instead  of the Sentinels keeping tracks of the Mutants, what if in the MCU they are created to keep a eye on Superheroes, due to what happened with the blip/snap."

pchadrow,1613142950.0,"I think this is close but not quite. The hex is the seal but I don't think ""breaking it"" really matters. The hex seals in yo magic which the kid died because he couldn't get to it. Vision is alive inside the hex because he's in the magic. As soon as he leaves the hex though hes outside of it and he begins to wither away. Basically, vision can only survive while he's in the magic or he'll decay

Also, I think almost evey kid remembers that one snakpak that you just COULD NOT open"
Jack-of-the-Shadows,1613142954.0,"Yeah, and its shit, so i kinda hate them coming into the MCU. Marvel mutants could work in a continuity seperate from the other superpowered beings, but even then its mucky.

Just reminder that Tony Stark did not even get community service for making Ultron, and that the only reason there is a 5 year gap is that Tony demanded he keep his little family for the reverse snap.

But no, its the poor oppressed superpowered people that dominate every aspect of the planet that sooo oppressed by the powerless masses of muggles.

natenatedies,1613143006.0,"Yeah a lot of people are stuck on the 2000 thing. Dick van Dyke started in 1961 but was the main inspiration for the 50's episode.

They just used Malcolm in the Middle because even though it started in 2000 it was still informed by the 90's. Camcorders, grunge rock, PS1, and low rise jeans are all from that decade. Also if they had used something like Full House or Roseanne it would have been too similar to the 80's episode."

tocla1,1613143076.0,I get all these references to mephisto make sense but I think it really is Pietro from X-Men. My theory is that Dr Strange went across the multiverse to get him and briefed him on Wanda's past because he knew that Pietro is the only person that Wanda would tell the truth to.
gAcksaurio,1613143079.0,"Okay Hayward, we get it, you are a total piece of thrash, and now, because of your plan, almost everyone is inside the Hex but Jimmy and our ""molecular changing, soon Photon"" Monica, both of them are going to save you ass and hopely get you fired :)"
tetoffens,1613143082.0,One is about a super powered family and the other is about twins. So it fits what is happening.
Brookings18,1613143088.0,"So, are we safe to rule out Agnes not having anything to do with what's going on? She seems just as much a victim as everyone else. Or she's just manipulating Vision by pretending to be one. Weird how she was also credited this episode, too.

Comic costumes for everyone! So happy Quicksilver and the future Wiccan got in on the fun. Really respectable way to pay homage to the comics without being sarcastic (like the Netflix shows). Hope Wanda keeps the headpiece.

Okay, what's up with Pietro? He seems to be aware that Wandas made a sitcom and knows that he and Vision are dead (that dead husband line was great), as well as having memories with Wanda. Did Wanda or whoever's really pulling the strings just pull in a guy who looks like him (hopefully from the multiverse, because I really like that concept), or did she just create him but forgot a few details because he's been dead for so long?"

CR_MadMan,1613143243.0,"I think it would stand to reason that everyone inside Westview has been affected / altered. Why would Rambeau be the only one? And it'll probably be established at the END of the season. Letting us (the audience) know about Rambeau is foreshadowing to what's going to happen to everyone else in Westview. 

Also, Evan Peters returning as Quicksilver I think is more foreshadowing to mutants being introduced into the MCU. Why not bring back Aaron Taylor-Johnson? It's Disney. They have the money to hire anyone that they want.

ALSO, what's up with the twins gaining powers? Yeah, their mother as powers... because she's originally a mutant.

So, yeah. I think we'll get mutants by the end of the season... and Mephisto... He's probably that creepy looking plague doctor that was behind Wanda in the silly string scene."

Why was she on the edge of town? It sure seems like she was trying to get out, even though most of the ""controlled"" people don't have enough willpower to even attempt that."
enchantrem,1613143651.0,"> I think it would stand to reason that everyone inside Westview has been affected / altered.

Definitely, but whether those alterations are permanent and include *powers* still seems to be up in the air to me.

> Why would Rambeau be the only one?

Wanda personally pushed her out of the thing through her own wall and through the next house; she knew that if she didn't also protect Rambeau such an assault would kill her.  So Wanda ""touched"" Monica with her powers in a way she hasn't done to anybody else at this point.

> Evan Peters returning as Quicksilver I think is more foreshadowing to mutants being introduced into the MCU. Why not bring back Aaron Taylor-Johnson?

The real answers here are: Evan Peters tests better with audiences, the writers know a lot of fans are going to be speculating about the FoX-Men franchise, and the whole project is built to continually increase its own hype (in addition to being a solid add to the MCU and a compelling story in its own right).

> ALSO, what's up with the twins gaining powers? Yeah, their mother as powers... because she's originally a mutant.

Wanda has powers in the MCU because of experiments with the Mind Stone, and her kids have powers because she wanted kids and she imagines them as sharing many of her and Vision's qualities.  From a ""constructed sit-com reality"" perspective the premise of ""humble suburban family hiding secret super powers"" effectively requires the kids to have powers.

I'm not saying your predictions are necessarily wrong but the basis of them from what we've seen so far is wobbly at best."

But there's this dumb idea being pushed on certain YouTube channels or websites that Captain Marvel in the movies is only super powerful because she's a woman and something something Brie Larson.  But no, she's just that damn strong.  It just kind of sticks out in the movies because we hadn't seen anyone else with power levels that high (Wanda's closest, but they hadn't shown much of her full potential at that point).  Oh, and Doctor Strange (but was still learning how to be Sorcerer Supreme).  I get why we haven't, though.  You start out with smaller stories that let people build up some kind of connection with the heroes before introducing all the huge heavy-hitters who can take on armies.

With the expansion of the HEX those people may now be saved but there will be new people now stuck in the “boundary” zone so “starvation” time is reset but still a real danger eventually"

When Vision wanted to go on Neighborhood Watch, Pietro stepped up and said he’d go trick-or-treating with the kids, which calmed Wanda. Then when Vision was trying to break out of the Hex, Pietro said it’s not like he can die twice, which didn’t work but felt like a desperation call. All the while, Pietro was asking a lot of the same questions that Vision had been trying to ask in the prior episode. I know Vision shouldn’t remember who Pietro was but maybe he had a slight memory in the back of his mind and that’s why Pietro looks different."

DNAwesome,1613144149.0,"I have a theory that Wanda got supercharged when she was Bliped and she is now an Omega level mutant (the first in the MCU).
Before endgame she could only do telepathy and telekinesis clearly powers that being in close contact with the Mind stone’s cosmic energy would giver but a noticeable “depowering” of her comics level greatness.
The first thing we see from Wanda when she comes back is her going to town on Thanos. Most have written that off as pure rage and anger but I think it was the first signs of the power stone having supercharged her first powers derived from the mind stone. 
Wanda’s mental control over people is further evidence that her original power of telepathy was supercharged by the Power Stone. 
Wanda is clearly controlling Time evidence by the decades leaping and the fact that in Episode 6 it’s a completely new day in the hex while only minutes have passed outside evident by them walking back in from their standoff with Wanda from the last episode.
In Dr. Strange we learn that the MCU magic can alter reality to some degree but by going in the pocket dimension they can more easily bend reality to their will within that pocket, usually represented by the shattering effect. Since bliped she is showing reality bending examples with the boarder being the pocket dimension she has created. Because her reality warping ability comes straight from the Ether, and combo of other gems her changes can be permanent to an extent. But a rewriting back to “original” reality happens after people cross the hard boarder Rambau’s clothes and body when kicked out, Wanda changing when exiting, and The Vision fading.
This implies that within her dimension-the hex- she can do more to bend reality but things like death, and time, revert back to laws of nature.
She is using the power of the Soul stone to bring back Vision since in the stone All dead souls live, which can also explain Pietro coming back because her pocket reality may allow her to put souls/essences into dead bodies. This maybe why Vision remembers nothing before this reality while Pietro remembers “his life” up until he dies (soul going to the stone) but then regains existence when she subconsciously needs him. Given the cost of obtaining the soul stone it may stand to reason that in the MCU when used alone is most effective at allowing people to talk to loved ones which supercharged within her pocket reality allows for corporal souls outside the universe in the soul stone.
She used ability pertaining to the space stone to summon people into the Hex from around the world. With clues showing that people started disappearing around the same time. 
I think everyone in the Hex will become the first mutants in the MCU given the evidence that they have been rewritten at a molecular level. Also her eyes clearly resembled the Ether when she expanded the hex."
bellowingbullfinches,1613144157.0,"“Hacking” is a broad term basically meaning anything that gains unauthorized access to data. So, for instance, seeing someone’s password on a sticky note and typing it in is “hacking.” In fact, social engineering is an extremely prevalent type of hacking and it doesn’t involve mashing random keys on a keyboard for ten seconds like they do on CSI. 

It’s not at all unreasonable that Darcy could’ve done something under the term “hacking” to access the files.

The only point they lose me is when she specifically mentions a “firewall,” but it’s possible she was spouting jargon to sound more impressive. That’s totally in line with the character."

juscallmejjay,1613144180.0,"Full opposite on this one babe. He had one agent that has been inside the anomaly and interacted with the suspected persons and he completely ignored her advice and intel (which was that although Wanda is in control her goal is not to harm or murder and that more intel is needed). But he ignores it in full almost as if he had his own agenda to fill. He uses Monica's well-devised plan of using a vintage drone to contact Wanda and instead of making any attempt to negotiate or figure out what was happening...he fired a missile at the target not only endangering the nearby innocent children but putting the entire town at risk. As Monica said, they have no idea what is going on in there. If they kill Wanda how do they know the bubble won't just be stuck there forever? How do they know it won't break the minds of all 4000 residents? What if Wanda was willing to negotiate? I guess well never know now that he fired a bomb at her children. Psychopath. When confronted about this rash decision his response is to explain that he is traumatized by the blip and clearly has a bias towards enhanced individuals making him unable to do his job. 

I am not sure what you think Monica, Jimmy, and Darcy have done to deserve to be tossed out besides you know...call him a coward. They are the only 3 to make any headway in this mission. I dont think he is some crazy evil villain....but I think he is pretty bad at his job and is clearly making decisions based off his emotions and biases (he literally seems willing to sacrifice the entire town to take out Wanda) and is definitely not a ""good guy.""

Personally, I think the video from the other episode shows he was operating and experimenting on Visions corpse (against Visions will apparently) and it seems hell do anything to keep this information under wraps and get Vision's corpse back. This mainly being eliminating the primary witness to his crimes (Wanda) and making sure Vision dies so he can continue his work with the ultimate goal being to create a Vision-like synthezoid to be a deterrent against super-powered beings."

swissarmychris,1613144398.0,"> He clearly isn't affected by Wanda's mind control, since he's very aware of what she's up to and even presses her about it. With that information, if he was from the X-Men universe and ALSO unaffected by Wanda's powers, how come he ""remembers"" growing up in Sokovia? How come he ""remembers"" events differently from Wanda? How does he not remember his own universe?

We've seen that even people not fully under Wanda's control (like Vision) can still have their minds messed with. It's possible that the Hex is responsible for the discrepancies in what he knows. Everyone in Westview had the knowledge of their new lives put into their heads -- for example, Abilash's co-workers know that he is now ""Norm"" and that they work at ""Computational Services, Inc"". They know whatever is needed to play their parts.

Quicksilver's part is to be Wanda's brother. So it kind of makes sense that he has surface-level knowledge of Pietro's life, but some of the details are missing. He got magically briefed on his role, just like everyone else, but he doesn't actually have all of those memories.

Of course, that leaves the question of who he actually is wide open. He could be the Fox Quicksilver, playing the part of MCU Quicksilver in Wanda's show. Or he could be Mephisto. Or just a random person who kind of looked like Pietro (though in that case, Wanda would also be responsible for his super-speed)."

Yes, I know there are 10000000 ""this character is Mephisto"" theories but hear me out.

\-Vision is dead. Like, absolutely dead. We have seen his lifeless corpse sitting with Wanda.

\-Wanda has the power to ""summon"" alternate versions of dead characters and ""recast"" them (like Pietro/Peter). But Wanda is not aware of it, to her eyes, she did bring them back to life.

\-What if Wanda tried to do the same with Vision but when she opened up the portal to summon a Vision from an alternate universe....*something else* jumped instead and possessed Vision's lifeless corpse?

The Vision is both resurrected with his old personality AND he's also Mephisto/Nightmare/RandomDemon.

In the comics, both of Wanda's kids are literally demon spawns (they are part of the soul of a demon called Master Pandemonium)."

I'm very bummed about it. I still hope that we'll get Evan Peters later, perhaps in Dr. Strange 2, but I'm curious to know the reason why they cast him if he is not supposed to be from the Fox universe.

Wanda’s powers are basically an incredibly strong influence, and prevents the residents of Westview from thinking about leaving, thinking about their past lives, etc.

OneAlternate,1613145234.0,"I’m most curious about how Wanda, Vision, Tommy and Billy’s relationship will last in the future. Unless Wanda rewires Vision’s personality again, there’s probably going to be a huge fight. Tommy is my favorite of the twins, but I wonder how this is going to impact both of them, especially since they truly believe they are Wanda’s kids (Maybe not “truly” because everyone else is aware, but almost nobody other than Vision and Pietro are able to acknowledge it.). I want to see what happens to them once they’re reunited with their actual families. 

That commercial  was off, but this entire episode seemed off. In the first episode, it was cheery and the commercial was normal, but now that things are tense between Wanda, Vision, and Pietro, it seems that the commercials are carrying the consequences and weight of Wanda’s magic more. 

I think it was interesting how Wanda kept people in Westview, but didn’t use them. They just stood there, like the woman who kept hanging up the ghost. Those people are being controlled, are most likely more aware than the others that they’re being controlled, and yet *cannot move*. 

Last point: It’s really weird how Wanda’s magic works. I thought that the people in the outside ring would be like that because Wanda needed some extras, but Agnes drove too far away and she also froze. I kind of took that as Wanda’s magic having a radius in which it is most potent, and then it being less strong farther away. However, she just expanded the radius of the entire town, so I doubt it’s a limit on her magic. Maybe Agnes was like the outer people because she tried to escape and her mind shut down because of it?"

ClayHasLlamas,1613145235.0,Oh fuck my bad it was 6 am and my brain wasn’t working lol
demon_ix,1613145250.0,"Things I noticed about the Hex:

* This one's pretty obvious. People further away from the ""action"", or the parts that are being shown, receive less and less attention from whoever is running the show. The woman hanging decorations just repeats the same motion over and over to create some background activity, and the people near the edge don't move at all. This is fairly common in computational scenarios like video games, where if something isn't being displayed on the screen, it has no business taking up resources. This leads me to further suspect >!Ultron as the ""man in charge"", despite all the clues towards Mephisto!<.
* Wanda can manipulate the Hex, as we see twice now by changing it's nature (the red glow from episode 5) or by expanding it, but it retains it's [hexagonal shape](https://imgur.com/DqeR6GT.jpg), and it's center point. The only [visible deformation](https://imgur.com/ChWt25c.jpg) is from the spot where Vision attempted to leave. I still think whatever is controlling events is located at the center of the Hex.
* Wanda didn't just freeze everyone she was mind-controlling when she expanded the Hex. She froze time itself. You can see the [wacky-inflatable-man baloon](https://imgur.com/dtBKqWU.jpg) freeze up alongside everyone else in one of the shots, and the [light-effects on some of the walls](https://imgur.com/ALtxTdx.jpg) freeze up in others."

ghqwertt,1613145301.0,"It definitely feels like a 2000s sitcom though. Single-camera, no laugh track, light background music, lots of cutaway gags. Think of the shows that are similar: Scrubs, Arrested Development, 30 Rock, Community, CYE, Sunny, etc.

I think it was the first of the single-camera shows, but it is definitely not like the sitcoms of the 90s.

Edit: Rolling Stone [confirms](https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/wandavision-recap-episode-6-all-new-halloween-spooktacular-1127481/) that Malcolm started the single-camera trend in the US. Not long after, the UK Office did single-camera but with a mockumentary take."

Your comment is all over the place and I'm not sure what you're trying to say.

>showing random people who aren't mentioned in any of the phases to show up and talk about how devastated and hurt they are.

That's obviously not what I mean. You're arguing a point I never made. They spend about 10 minutes on the aftermath then go into a weird time heist. Could have (and arguably should have) cut out the time time travel and spend time on the aftermath.

>Meanwhile the SUPERHERO movie everyone came to see can just take the back seat.

Because superheroes are irrelevant to the plot. People care about the characters, their arcs, and they're struggles. The fact they're superheroes are a bonus, frankly. We can take this further, why would THOR care about LOKI? Why not get to the punching?

>That wouldn't have bummed anyone out at all and not been borimg at all

Bummed out? Yes. But no more than Infinity War already did. Boring? Why would it be boring? 

>heck why didnt they just play a whole 2 hr Schnidler List esque movie to show exactly how traumatising the times are.

Yeah, why not? The film asks 'is killing 50% able to save the world?' And never follows up on that. Did it? I honestly have no idea. Are people starving? Has peace descended on earth? Hows international relations? Are people more religious? 

The film hypes up Thanos's argument and then just ignores it."

WoottonMajor,1613145581.0,"I think it's this, but it's also referencing Infinity War. Reposting my comment from another thread:

So, IMO the commercials all directly reference each of the movies Wanda’s appeared in (apart from the first being her backstory). The Hydra Soak one threw me, but after last week they’re just too on the nose to be anything else now. Don’t get me wrong I think they all have multiple meanings within the context of the show, but thematically each is tied to a movie:

Ep 1 - The Toaster - Backstory - Stark missile

Ep 2 - Strucker Watch - Captain America: Winter Soldier (post credit scene) - Strucker experimenting on Wanda.

Ep 3 - Hydra Soak - Avengers: Age of Ultron - Hydra ~~brainwashing~~ radicalizing her to fight the Avengers (I think the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. soap reference is just a nice Easter egg)

Ep 5 - Lagos Paper Towels - Captain America: Civil War - Lagos incident where she caused dozens of civilian casualties.

Ep 6 - Yo-Magic - Avengers: Infinity War - not surviving the snap (the snack for survivors) and her magic not saving Vision or stopping Thanos.

Ep 7 - Should reference Endgame. And being the last of the “sit-com episodes” it’ll probably be the last commercial so it would make sense.

Edit: As a few people pointed out brainwashing is not the right word."

The rest of the team has to return to their own lives and jobs and families, but she'd been blipped back into existence in a world in which no one was looking for her. Where would she go?

swissarmychris,1613145608.0,"I'm honestly not sure who he is at this point, but him knowing about growing up in Sokovia and his death in AoU doesn't necessarily prove or disprove anything. 

All the residents of the town are fed knowledge about the ""show"" to allow them to play their parts (like how everyone knows Abliash's name is now Norm). Quicksilver's part is to play Wanda's brother, so he has some surface-level knowledge about Pietro's life.

I think the fact that he still has super-speed is a bigger hint than anything. The only other powered person in the Hex is Vision, and it's because he had powers to begin with. Whoever Pietro is, he has Quicksilver's powers.

My current guess is that this *is* the Fox Quicksilver with his memories replaced with Pietro's. But it won't come into play until the whole thing is over, once the Hex has worn off and everyone goes back to normal. QS will still be there and everyone will be like, ""wait, if you're not Pietro then who are you?"" And he'll be like ""I'm Peter Maximoff, I grew up in New York with my mom. Is Charles around?""

The other characters are mindcontrolled into their acting roles and require a script to act. Writing and directing is resourceheavy, so only the relevant or closest actors get a script, the rest are extras made to look busy.

Again, Pietro and the kids are complete constructs of Wandas mind, so they can write their own script or give feedback to Wanda whenever they want.

Or, has the world gone to shit? Half the knowledge has gone pushing us back to the 50's. Sudden need to teach and educate means farming, medicine and science has stagnated. Has countries pushed in a pro birth agenda to build up their collective ranks? Did 1 country have a proportionally higher death toll and their neighbour's a  lower death and with a numerical advantage war and genocide kicked in?

All of Wanda's sheer power, and all of her telepathic ability or any powers to do with the mind, have all been building up and up until she reached the point that she not only had the raw power to compete with an infinity stone, but also an ability to manipulate the mind to rival the mind stone itself. Essentially, she is the new mind stone, not only in the fact that she rivals its power, but also in that she spent a large amount of energy destroying the original mind stone which, who knows, could have enabled her to tap into some of the abilities and connections that the minestrone had had - such as it's connections to both Vision and Pietro. Consider then the possibility that she could have replicated or resurrected the consciousness of both Vision and Pietro out of the stone.

Now for resurrecting Vision, the process is relatively simple. He needs his mind/consciousness back, and she has it. He needs a mind stone to make his body whole. She represents that mind stone. As long as he stays in proximity to her, his body is held together by the force that is her powers, hence when he tried to leave the Hex, it was as if the stone was being torn from him again and as such his body wasn't able to stay together.

For Pietro, it's not so simple. She has a mind, but not a body. The only way she has managed to make living organisms so far is to birth them. And I doubt she wants to birth her own brother. So she needs another body suitable for Pietro, his memories, his consciousness and his powers. That's where FOX's ""Peter"" comes in, someone whose mind is already adjusted to similar powers and whose lineage is similar. She implants the Pietro personality onto him, but as seen with all the other residents of Westview, she's not able to erase the underlying personalities of those she's manipulating, she's just able to keep it at bay. That's why we see this Pietro with all the right memories, but not the right personality. He is still FOX's ""Peter"", just with his own memories suppressed in favour of the ones Pietro should have

A big question lies in how tf she gets FOX's Peter, if it's possible that she managed to yank him out of the multiverse or if she had help from someone/something else, which of course gives more labour to the Mephisto theories

I also wanna say real quick that it'll be REALLY strange if we don't get Mephisto or even some other interdimensional being out of this, considering all the indicators (Tommy/Billy/Speed/Wiccan, Peter, magical conception/birthgiving, sudden boost in Wanda's powers). I wouldn't be disappointed if he did/didn't show up but it would be strange. Like Doctor Strange 😉😉"

LoyalScrewup,1613146562.0,"Theory: The residents of the town are those who were snapped and returned to find that their loved ones had died. Someone is using Wanda’s magic and Vision’s processing capabilities to trap people in this dream realm and feed off their trauma and grief. 

Agnes is always there to give Wanda anything to keep her satisfied and distracted, because she is the one who benefits. That’s why she was at the barrier with Vision, to lure him outside so that Wanda expands the Hex to bring her more souls. This is also why Monica was sucked into the Hex: When she recounts her experience under its influence, you can see her flashing memories of finding out her mother was dead.

When Norm told Vision that ‘she’s always in my head’ he’s referring to Agatha. Like Monica, he returned from the snap not knowing what happened to his loved one. Agatha is the MCU version of Nightmare, and she feeds off grief, rather than souls.

Quicksilver was sent in by an outside party (Strange?) to appeal to Wanda’s conscience and snap her out of it. You can even see a figure zipping around as the barrier is breached in episode 5.

On Rambeau’s dry erase board in episode 5, you can see ‘Unshielded: X’ which would imply that if someone goes into the hex unshielded, they get the mutant X gene. I think that when the hex is widened, we’re getting ‘No, more mutants’."

imcastbound,1613146609.0,So 3 episodes left... How will this end?
Basic-Piccolo-6356,1613146615.0,nah it wouldnt make sense and also be lame tbh
dhruva-harit,1613146616.0,"I think Pietro is sent by Hayward, who can either access the multiverse or knows someone who can. Pietro can also somehow communicate with Hayward. This would explain why Wanda didn't see him coming, why Pietro knows about things after he 'died', why it's the different quicksilver, and why he is so curious about how Wanda did it. Also I think the Hex doesn't affect things from a different universe, hence Hayward is able to get data from inside the Hex. This would also explain why Pietro is able to have independent thoughts."
Frontier246,1613146619.0,"Man, it hit seeing Aaron Taylor-Johnson Quicksilver's death again.

It was nice to see the twins settling more into their comic characterizations, right down to Tommy taking so much after Pietro right down to the powers (white hair still incoming) and Billy wearing a homemade version of his comic costume. 

Elizabeth Olsen in the classic Scarlet Witch costume has been promoted so much, but man did she look amazing in it. And Paul Bettany in the classic Vision look with those yellow shorts! We even get Evan Peters sporting the classic Quicksilver look. 

Hayward's a jerk and shady, but Darcy's comments were uncalled for. There's only so much you can be glib about a guy almost getting killed. 

Hey, MCU Jimmy Woo can throw a good punch when he needs to.

Yeah, it seems like Monica is pretty close to gaining her powers at this point. One last dip in the Hex might be enough to do it. 

So Agnes seems to be as controlled as everyone else is, but is she manipulating Vision against Wanda?

What is this version of Pietro doing? He's there to fulfill the goofy, mischievous, uncle role in the sitcom, but he's also ""in the know"" and prodding Wanda about it. It's like there are people in this world who function just to serve but others who are knowingly trying to push Wanda into something.

So SWORD is definitely after Vision, their ""asset,"" and I'm guessing CATARACT was designed to weaponize Vision.

Is the new commercial supposed to represent Wanda discovering magic? It got pretty morbid. 

It really would've taken that guy two seconds to unfcuff Darcy instead of just leaving her there. Well, I guess now she gets to join the sitcom, which might be kind of fun.

Wanda needs to save Vision, who can only exist in Westview, so she extends the Hex which covers even more people and area, making things demonstrably worse (especially when some of the people in the Hex are seemingly frozen in place and can't do anything but stand around and maintain the visual of the illusion). Those poor SWORD Agents."

nyang305,1613146686.0,"This episode’s really got me thinking about where Pietro came from and was it really Wanda who “recasted” him as Darcy says. It seems like he is one of the few details of the Hex that wanda didn’t control. She had so many questions for him, which seems to imply that even SHE is confused about his origin. He also seems to be so self aware of his place in her world and her purpose for creating this world, more so than a lot of people in Westview (except for maybe Agnes). Earlier in the episode, he says his part in the story is to “Come to town unexpectedly. Create tension with the brother-in-law, stir up trouble with the rugrats, and ultimately give you grief.” This all just makes me wonder where he could have came from, and if he isn’t part of Wanda’s doing, then who implanted him in there??"

Look at how tired he was after stopping the train, or during Cap's speech about fighting to the end, there's a shot of Pietro stopping to catch his breath.

GreyCrowDownTheLane,1613147067.0,"I said it was *not* Peter from the Fox X-Men movies, and it looks like I'm right. He's MCU Pietro and he just has a different face. 

I had faith that they wouldn't incorporate that terrible Fox continuity into the MCU in any way, and I stand by that. I'm also relieved. I think we can count on Deadpool being all the same actors, but a different Deadpool that just happens to have a history that is virtually identical to the one in the Fox universe, only without all the interactions with the X-Men. 

Now, on to other things:

Monica is definitely becoming Photon, and from what they said in this episode about how the Hex is affecting people, I suspect everyone in that town will be the MCU's first mutants. At least anyone who passed through the walls of the Hex, anyway. Oh, and the boys are obviously mutants. 

Is Agnes really Agatha Harkness? If she is, she's doing a damned good job of faking being one of Wanda's victims. Also, we saw Wanda herself spread out the barrier, so we know it's not that she's being ""framed"" -- She's doing this. The question is whether or not she's being manipulated. 

I am really wondering what's going to happen to Darcy now. Who will she be in Wanda's world? And will she end up getting powers when it's all over? 

I really don't think Mephisto has anything to do with any of this, folks. 

I'm still crossing my fingers hoping that Monica's contact is Reed Richards, but they may surprise us with another callback from the MCU films or shows. Maybe it's Fitz-Simmons. Maybe it's The Leader. 

I just had a thought: What if they use all this as a way to introduce The Beyonder or The Molecule Man? This is right up their alleys. I could see either one of them being in mental contact with Wanda and misinterpreting her desires, then re-shaping things to please her. It's doubtful, but stranger things have happened in MCU movies (Howard the Duck, Cosmo the dog, Beta Ray Bill's face)."
TheOkComputerGuy,1613147070.0,"I think Wanda can resurrect him as ""easily"" as Shuri can pull him apart from the Mind Stone. It's possible, but probably took her an incredible amount of energy to do.

When Vision died again, it's possible she ended up over expending her power, because even she does not know the limits of them, as noted from her conversation with Peter. She basically subconsciously  told herself she was way more powerful than she knew. ""I was just feeling so lonely, endlessly"", so she made an entire town of people her friendly neighbors and community. She's been holding back in pretty much every instance we see her, but I think this is the first time she genuinely lost all control. She attacked Peter, she frightened her children. ""I didn't want to lose Vision again"", is what she thought. And her powers made it so.

Remember when Thanos snapped with the Infinity Stone? It's energy created a ""cosmic boom"" kind of like a sonic boom but on a cosmic scale. Wanda is the Reality Stone. She likely created a ""dimensional boom"". In the comics the stones have a ""pair"" relationship, a mastery of one, grants proficiency in another. The Soul Stone is powered by a user's mastery of REALITY, which preserves the soul to allow for life after death."" Wanda revived the dead, she clearly has mastered Reality. She was Born of the Mind Stone and granted Telepathy of Intelligence. The Reality stone's power is born of a person's mastery of TIME. What were Vision's last words to Wanda?

**""WE, are, out of time.""**

She's obsessed with the TIME she has left with Vision.

*checks notes*

Turns out mastery of the Reality stone grants: **ACCESS TO THE MULTIVERSE**

Wanda opened the multiverse to save Vision, expanding it's singularity to consume all conceivable space, to prevent Vision from ever dying by leaving her domain again.

WOW I have no clue how this comment took me here but I love the MCU."
Furinkazan616,1613147072.0,"Sure, i can buy that, but it's still lame as fuck for Quicksilver to go out so easily in his first movie, before he even became an Avenger officially, and i'll always think that.

This episode she said she just needs to get to her guy on the ridge. I believe this to mean her guy went into the bubble for her, using his engineering to sneak in. How else would Pietro know about Vision dying? Monica gave him a bit of backstory to play the character. Monica also wasn’t shocked that her “brother” showed up because she sent him in. That’s why this Pietro knows some of what’s going on and it’s why he’s asking stuff like “how’d you do it?”"

2) Pietro's wounds. If he were a multiverse version of Pietro, why does he have the same wounds as MCU pietro? Even if it were just a random body she's animating, why have those wounds?

3) vison's head wound not appearing when he left the hex. You'd imagine that would be the first place that would fall apart, but it didn't.

So to save him, she pull the earth into that separate reality that still has a Mind Stone, so Vision can never leave her domain again.

demon_ix,1613147426.0,"The Vision flying up scene was more about sound than sight, imo. As he listens closely, he hears a lot of people and activity in the center of the town where Wanda and the kids are, but everywhere else is quiet.

As for the actual shape of the Hex, I think we're looking at a [Hexagonal Prism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_prism). It has 6 sides in the horizontal plane, but is capped on either side vertically. It could also be that it's uncapped but the effect decays over distance, but so far we've only seen the horizontal sides and the effect of the Hex there is very abrupt. One spot is inside, one spot is out, no ""decay"" in between excepting for the barrier.

I also think the purpose of expanding the barrier was to get Vision back inside as soon as possible, but the scene also established that Wanda couldn't sense where Vision was exactly. She only knew he was near the barrier facing soldiers, much like she did in the previous episode, so extending the Hex in all directions seems like the best strategy to get him inside quickly.

I guess Darcy just got unlucky (or lucky, we'll see) that Vision decided to pop out on the exact spot of the SWORD base. Or maybe it wasn't luck and Agnes was leading him there, who knows."
swissarmychris,1613147429.0,"Not a bad theory, but it's worth pointing out that *everyone* in the Hex has ""a bit of backstory to play the character"".

rascalkong,1613147673.0,"My theory is this:  Agnes is the villain.  She plays the best friend to Wanda, staying close, cheerfully reinforcing the sitcom by helping to move the plot along.

So far, Agnes is kicking ass.

I think ""Pietro"" is Agnes' thrall.  He's there to keep Wanda grieving, which makes her easy to control.  Not sure what the endgame is (pardon me for using that word)  but Agnes is a master manipulator.  Maybe not the best actress (she was hamming it up in the car pretty hard)  but she's playing Wanda and Vision like fiddles.

Uncanny_Doom,1613147940.0,"It could, but I feel like it functionally changes what the mutants are and would make them very derivative of the Inhumans.

If this was the route they took I think it would disappoint/underwhelm some people and cause a bit of fan backlash, especially because there have already been polarizing comic arcs that involved the Inhumans as a threat to mutantkind.

It fundamentally changes the X-Men and tons of themes around them if they aren't a natural evolutionary race and are instead empowered by an incident of some kind.

That isn't to say I don't think some version of this couldn't work. I think if they do something as simple as saying Wanda *already* had the X gene and Hydra's experiments on her and Pietro simply accelerated it's development, and she does the same thing by the end of the show I feel like that could work. Basically if it's saying ""Mutants were always here and coming, she just made them happen faster and is one of them"" versus ""She invented mutants which are functionally the same as Inhumans"" then it's much better to me."

So if Wanda was able to put vision back together again all she would need is the mind stone to bring back vision....

We see vision has the mind stone on his head. Wandas power came from the mind stone and she is insanely powerful. So the only leap we’d have to take is she is powerful enough to recreate the mindstone and and vision is vision again.

swissarmychris,1613148170.0,"> I told you all that it was not Peter from the Fox X-Men movies, and it looks like I'm right. He's MCU Pietro and he just has a different face.

I'm still not convinced. Whoever this QS is, it seems like he has cursory knowledge of Pietro's life, but not all of his memories. Just like everyone else playing a part in Wanda's show.

They also made a big deal about not being able to ""fix dead"" and then this guy shows up. Hmm, who do we know that looks like Evan Peters, has super-speed, and is *not* dead?

I admit I was guessing that the reveal in this episode would be some kind of multiverse tie-in, but that also would have thrown a huge wrench into the current plot. But I still think we might get that reveal at the very end of the show. Once the Hex is gone and everyone's free of Wanda's influence, who is Evan Peters going to be? His final scene could be him revealing that he's *Peter* Maximoff, and that he grew up in the US with his mom. Boom, there's your Multiverse of Madness tie-in.

I agree that they're not going to try and bring the whole X-men continuity into the MCU. But they can still bring over select actors to play ""alternate universe"" characters without worrying about what happened in that other universe. It would be a really clever way to introduce the multiverse, since it's kind of a weird concept for non-comic-fans, but everyone gets the idea of reboots and remakes having different continuities."
ranhalt,1613148176.0,"Pietro's awareness and ""recasting"" tells me that not only is it not Pietro in any way, but it's someone infiltrating who is not under Wanda's control.

I get it—he’s portraying the angry, fail-to-listen to your subordinates, talk with your fist mentality but damn, given the circumstance... Wanda’s world is literally *rewriting* peoples DNA on a molecular level, imprisoning hundreds of people (thousands?) and he’s supposed to just let Rambeau take over the situation with lip service?

It’s so trope-y. The Rambeau lines seems so hamfisted and like she has access to info no one else does. No, “we have to wait it out and work with Wanda, it’s the only way”. I think Hayward is the only one who’s really acting ordinary given the circumstances. 

Obviously it’s going to work out like Rambeau says—“if Wanda is the problem, she needs has be the solution”, but that’s more of the result of the narrative being determined, not an accurate representation of how anyone would act in that scenario. 

Rambeau’s been handed answers to the test she shouldn’t have and Hayward is the student who’s just mad there’s a pop quiz at all."

FGoon,1613148743.0,">We've seen that even people not fully under Wanda's control (like Vision) can still have their minds messed with. It's possible that the Hex is responsible for the discrepancies in what he knows. Everyone in Westview had the knowledge of their new lives put into their heads -- for example, Abilash's co-workers know that he is now ""Norm"" and that they work at ""Computational Services, Inc"". They know whatever is needed to play their parts.

The thing I'm basing my theory on is when Wanda said she didn't cause him to show up, which to me sounds like an outside force brought Fake Pietro to Wanda.

Wanda seemingly has little reaction to the fact that is isn't *her* Pietro (the group outside know it's not the same guy and mention it multiple times), which should be a MAJOR red flag that she's being screwed with.

>They know whatever is needed to play their parts.

If she was able to actually influence Fake Pietro, wouldn't she put her memories of Real Pietro in his head?"
akrmalhakimi,1613148747.0,"May be a stretch, but I think Nightmare, or Mephisto, pulled Quicksilver out of Fox’s timeline and threw him into Wandas reality distortion with original Pietros consciousness. Thats why it’s Evan Peaters quicksilver with Aaron Taylor Johnson’s thoughts. We know people who go into Wandas reality can be completely changed personality wise, so maybe Evan Peaters is confused and hurt himself because of the fact that either Mephisto or Nightmare is just using him to make Wanda suffer.

Maybe we’ll get a sequence where Evan Peaters is pulled out and he’s just confused as fuck as to how he got to where he is in MCU’s timeline."

Could the Lord of Darkness really not at least match man-made technology? Loki certainly can, so why not someone who, by all means, should be way better at deception and illusion than him?

The big wave is how the new mutants are created, and Wanda probably pulls a reverse HOM and creates more mutants since Hayward clearly wants to destroy them.

pietro mentions hearing Wanda's voice and coming back. he also mentions couples ""are together"". between that and the commercial, Wanda might actually be raising the dead to and reuniting them with their lovers, like vision. Agnes also emphasized Wanda bringing the dog back from the dead. 

pietro is way too interested in how Wanda is doing everything.

nightmare has also been mentioned repeatedly through this episode.

Wanda mentions not passing ellis street. ellis Island was where magneto was making more mutants.

Monica confirmed that the aerospace engineer is a guy. so Reed Richards is back on the table.

one of the files on the computer is r4-123. this is a comic about the fantastic 4 that features galactus and Agatha Harkness. 

in the last episode when Wanda mind controls the soldiers, her hand motion, twist, and walk off is the same as young magneto. 

there's a strange emphasis when pietro says their parents would have liked Westview. which could tie the father/daughter relationship of Wanda and magneto.

What if Strange did call for someone from the multi-verse, and knowing that the only person other than Vision who could speak to Wanda on an emotional level is her brother. So he's there to help, rather than all these theories that he is Mephisto, or Nightmare or whoever?

Another crazy theory: No one ever seems to mention the fact that Quicksilver is a SPEEDSTER IN THE COMIC BOOK UNIVERSE! And they're are the only kinds of superheroes that can (easily) cross universes (ala The Flash)... what if Professor X sent him across because there's an anomaly in the fabric of the Universe.

Like since Vision is slightly aware will he remember seeing Darcy? Or will Wanda just snap for fingers to make him forget. & the scene with Agnes and Vision was INSANITY. I want to know why he didn’t know who the avengers were, like is it because Wanda made him forget????? 

Also I get this episode is supposed to be 90s themed and we’ve never seen what the town really looked like and the town square reminded me a lot of Stars Hallow from Gilmore Girls. Which is like the epitome of the so called perfect life but I think that’s exactly what Wanda is going for here."

I agree with your poking the bear comment though, they all super outgunned. Which for me, makes it worse because if Rambeau does have all these superhero contacts, get a team in to kick Wanda’s ass, because at this point, she’s 100% a villain/threat, and should be treated as such."

Ya boy Doctor Strange. “The Multiverse Of Madness” directly refers to whatever broken blend of realities is left behind once the Westview Hex is resolved (because I can’t imagine it will be pretty). The movie will be Doctor Strange trying to free/battle Wanda amidst universes colliding with one another.

Darcy being an astrophysicist who also happens to be able to hack into a government facility’s servers, Jimmy Woo all of a sudden just starting fights with agents and somehow winning(was it ever hinted that this guy did not respect authority?) and Hayward becoming mustache twirling villain. 

It’s not terrible or anything, but it feels kind of jarring and disconnected from the Westview stuff in that it’s taking itself seriously, and then I have trouble taking it seriously.

Peter had to hold the back of Magneto's head so he wouldn't break his neck and if Pietro had that ability, he wouldn't have needed to sacrifice himself.

A First Class in the modern should be fine. It's a good excuse to have the original five be more diverse, which Disney is a fan of.

swissarmychris,1613150738.0,"As far as I know, the AoS canon has only ever gone in one direction. Events that happen in the MCU have affected AoS, but stuff in AoS has never been directly referenced in the movies.

You can believe what you want, but unless Randall Park's character brings it up, I'm assuming that the brief mention of his name in AoS was an easter egg and nothing more."
CMelody,1613150744.0,"I loved this episode with the heat of a billion exploding multiverses.  Seeing Wiccan and Speed in costume, Evan Peters nailing the crazy uncle shtick, the Malcolm in the Middle styling (complete with literal fourth wall breaking) and Team Monica rallying together, there was so much to get excited about.

I like how they are positioning Monica to get her own CM powers because of her cells being exposed to Wanda’s barrier too many times.  I want to see more of her in the MCU after this!

When Wanda uttered “Kick Ass” right after puzzling over Pietro’s new face, I had the biggest nerdgasm.   Everything about the Evan Peters/ATJ mash up and the characters pointing out the change brings me great joy.

Now in episode 6, Vision frees Agnes who directly implicates Wanda as the puppet-master. This along with the facts that Agnes is not always under Wanda’s control, does not have a “real” identity on SWORD’s investigation board, and did a wicked evil laugh in the same conversation with Vision makes me think that she isn’t just another resident of Westview."

WordsOfRadiants,1613150928.0,"If you're going by comics, Thor, Hulk, Scarlet Witch, Dr. Strange, and occasionally Iron Man are all often stronger than Captain Marvel. 

And there has been this trend where Hollywood's idea of feminism = Mary Sues and that they're just plain better than men, who are creepy/evil and/or gropey and it's alright for the female superheroes to beat the shit out of them. 

Captain Marvel was too powerful from the onset of her abilities and breezed through any challenges. A man tells her to smile and she nearly crushes his hand and steals his jacket + motorcycle. 

Rey was too powerful from the onset of her abilities and breezed through any challenge. She attacks and beats Luke Skywalker for doing evil and ""creating Kylo Ren"".

Wonder Woman was too powerful from birth and breezed through any challenge, easily defeating a god once she realizes the power of love. The 2nd movie was rife with creepy men lingering the streets and malls, who eventually get beaten up by her or Cheetah.

Ocean's 8, yet again the women are perfect and breeze through all challenges and again, gang up on a guy deemed creepy enough to deserve the hatred of all womenkind. 

Ghostbusters, yet again, the women solve and blaze through all challenges with ease to, yet again, face Another creepy evil dude.

Charlie's Angels, women are great and beat the men in everything from planning to physical fights, men are evil or creepy. Literally every guy was either evil or a creep and were all the enemy, and every woman was good and more capable than the men.

I'm not at all saying all female-led movies are like this, but a great many of the larger blockbusters Are, and it's not hard to see why people see a trend and blame Captain Marvel's Mary Sue-ness on that."

Yes misdirects happen all the time but there was literally a statement by the showrunner that they wouldn't have any F4 characters in it.

But according to a ComicBook interview with series creator Jac Schaeffer, there are no plans to bring in the Fantastic Four to the series, and the mentions of CMBR and astronauts were coincidences. Schaeffer full quote can be read below:

>""I have to tell you that thee CMBR, it was a coincidence. When I was putting my pitch together, I was trying to figure like, 'What's the science behind a broadcast? How does that even work?' When I was in college, I had a friend whose thesis was building this machine that was about measuring CMBR. So, I've always been really fascinated by relic radiation and the idea of also how television signals in the air work. I'm gonna embarrass myself if I talk about it...I've never really understood how TV signals work. I did a little bit of research, we had this expert and she helped me. CMBR was my own original pitch, separate from anything else as my own fascination. The thing about how radio waves are out deep in the universe, they just went out there and they just keep going out there. All of that seems like really fertile ground for a show about two Avengers in a sitcom.""


It's like people who keep on saying the next movie will introduce the X-Men and it's consistently wrong all the time. And even if they are introduced in something coming soon that still doesn't mean they'll get utilized in an earlier film or tv show.

We could get someone like Magneto or Xavier in a post-credit scene and still not have a film that really utilizes them until 5-7 years from now.

Another reason it's super unlikely that FF shows up is they haven't even been cast yet as far as we know and at the Disney investor meeting last year FF was the very last thing announced for Marvel Feige even said it was just getting started they're not even in preproduction yet for god sake.


Again I'm not saying that there won't be some big reveal because it's already been confirmed that there's a Luke Skywalker level reveal in Wanda Vision but I honest to god seriously doubt it will be the FF

Use Occam's Razor. The simplest explanation is usually the correct one. The more outlandish or convoluted the theory the less likely it is to occur. All of the Marvel post-credits have either been a lead in to the next film or something small related to the film it occurred in. 

Winter Soldier had Wanda and Pietro and they showed up later in Ultron. Ultron seeded Thor's journey and where he is in the beginning of Ragnarok and how the Avengers are doing by the time of Civil War.

If there is actually a FF reveal awesome! We both win... but I doubt it. Blue Marvel is Monica's boyfriend in the comics for awhile and has the background that Monica mentions."

swissarmychris,1613151822.0,"It's clear that Wanda isn't completely in control of the Hex. She definitely has a lot of influence, but she's adamant that she didn't start it, so someone else is definitely involved too. But is that person actively influencing events? Or just giving Wanda the power to do what she wants?

> Wanda seemingly has little reaction to the fact that is isn't her Pietro (the group outside know it's not the same guy and mention it multiple times), which should be a MAJOR red flag that she's being screwed with.

Wanda is desperately wanting to play make-believe to suppress her grief. She was definitely a little confused when Peters showed up at her door, but then she quickly accepts it -- why would she fight it? She's getting everything she wants, she just has to play along. (Also remember that she tries to test his memory, which only makes sense if she realizes he's different.)

> If she was able to actually influence Fake Pietro, wouldn't she put her memories of Real Pietro in his head?

Memories like growing up in Sokovia, remembering their parents, and dying after getting shot in the street?

I think we're in agreement that this isn't the Pietro that Wanda grew up with, but IMO it's up in the air whether he's something sinister (like Mephisto keeping an eye on her) or just the simulation giving her what she wants."

Telepathic Immunity: 

The healing factor causes his brain to be in a constant state of flux and regeneration, rendering him immune to psychics such as Cable, Emma Frost, and the Red Onslaught.[178][179] Deadpool can be looped into a telepathic psi-link to communicate with others mentally, as he did while a member of X-Force, but actually reading his mind can be confusing, even to an accomplished telepath like Psylocke.[180] This would not prevent him from being attacked psychically though.

Possession Resistance: 

Similar to the telepathic immunity, Deadpool is able to remain in control of himself while supernatural beings are trying to take control of him. During Xaphan's attempt to take control of him, Wade was able to fight for control of his body. No one can touch his soul.[181]

Star-with-clones,1613152083.0,"alright, agnes is a witch and evil. All the main cast was wearing their comic book outfits, and from the intro you can see she is part of the main cast, and dressed as a witch.

also, I'm convinced Hayward is evil and maybe HYDRA, especially with what happened and him clearly hiding something. One head cut off, 2 (Hayward and Agnes) will appear

I also think Ultron might show up, that SWORD, or at least Hayward, was trying to get that part out of Vision, if I'm right, all characters who had a big connection to Wanda have shown up in the show

And I also think Pietro isn't really him since he's asking too much, and he couldn't have known Vision is really dead. He's either working for Hayward or Agnes to make him get close to Wanda to see if he can get information out of her"

And I know Hayward was sus since the first time they showed him, but it's just boring that they're going this direction with him. I hope there's a twist and he turns out to be the good guy or something."
CorrectingSomeone,1613152237.0,"Doubling down on one prediction and making a couple others. Almost certainly extrapolating too much but:

- Wanda didn't summon Pietro. Wiccan did. Wanda had just told her twins about how she was sad Pietro was far away. Suddenly he shows up and she claims the knocks at the door weren't from her. I bet Wiccan can interact with the multiverse and so found her brother ""far away"" in the X-men universe since the one in her universe is dead.

--- I'm assuming his knowledge of things neither Pietro should know is a result of being around her now. That she has a mind-whammy going on him like on Vision, it is just a control she's struggling to maintain.

--- I bet next episode we get a scene where Vision ""unlocks"" Pietro's mind briefly and he is disoriented about being in the wrong universe and drops mention of the existence of mutants.

- Speaking of mutants, there was allusion to how Monica may get powers (the changes to her ""on the molecular level""). I suspect this might be foreshadowing something bigger - that in the end Wanda's power will radiate out to the world and be the awakening of mutant powers around the world. The mechanism behind a ""no, more mutants!"" twist on the comics.

--- This is somewhat also foreshadowed by the discussion of SWORD not knowing what might happen if they kill her. Perhaps she has a breakdown after being confronted by Vision, loses control and releases a burst of energy globally before turning herself over or something.


- Crazy version putting both together: 
--- Vision unlocks Pietro's mind and learns about mutants and realizes her powers didn't come from the stone but we're unlocked by the stone. 
---- Vision eventually confronts Wanda about Pietro being another universe version of her brother, them being mutants.
---- She releases Pietro's mind, learns more about the multiverse etc. from him.
----  Pietro and Vision confront her about what she's doing and having to accept and come to grips with the trauma in her life.
---- She breaks down and releases a burst of energy to unlock the abilities of others like her in the world so they can fight the traumas of their lives like she wishes she could. Then she is captured and taken to the raft or something like that."

If they went for true 90s we’d have gotten something like friends or Seinfeld. Which just doesn’t fit the raising kids vibe. The other 90s is like later full house and step by step which is the same architecture as the family ties/growing pains type. 

Maybe we’re all just fixated on the decades and it’s not about time. It’s about style:

-Three camera-live studio audience.

-Live studio audience- single camera.

-Live studio audience-colorized.

-Three camera-serious tone.

-Single camera w/ 4th wall break.

And last but not least:
 Single camera with subject interviews 🎉"

It'd give a good reason for the continued exploration of government up against heroes and over exerting their power and they can drag it out as long as they want as they can be a reoccurring presence.

I've been told they'd prefer to stay away from Mephisto because China doesn't like religion -- that is why the MCU always comes up with weird, pseudoscientific, quantum BS to explain events and characters' powers -- and that makes enough sense.

9/11 is an interesting example. Yes people were upset, but people were also right back in work the next day. The human spirit is unbeatable and people keep on trucking, we pulled through 2 world wars and rebuilt.

Shepsy,1613153065.0,"Posted this in the Easter-egg post, but I'll put my speculation here too:

Tommy shouted ""kickass!"" when running off with Quicksilver. This was immediately repeated by Wanda with an inquisitive tone to herself, as if she was remembering something. 

Aaron Taylor Johnson (AoU Quicksilver) and Evan Peters (WandaVision/Fox Quicksilver) both appeared in the Kick-Ass movie together.

My immediate reaction was that somehow Wanda has witnessed the Kick-Ass movie in another (our?) dimension and that's what crossed the streams with bringing Quicksilver back with the other actor. Maybe Mephisto made her realize her universe is a movie franchise alongside Fox's and their actors appear in other movies? And maybe her memory has been erased and this jogged her memory a little?

I would have argued it would be too early for characters to be aware of their role as a character in a movie, but with Deadpool and She-Hulk coming to the MCU, I think this may be setting up that explanation to the audience how they may know also.

This whole thing could just be an Easter-egg (and a counter-argument could be that Disney don't own the rights to Kick-Ass to even make it a major plot-point). However, the fact she repeated it put more emphasis on it, and if we go by [Chekhov's gun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chekhov%27s_gun#:~:text=Chekhov's%20gun%20\(Russian%3A%20%D0%A7%D0%B5%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B5%20%D1%80%D1%83%D0%B6%D1%8C%D1%91,by%20never%20coming%20into%20play.), I don't think this was just a throwaway line when it had that much attention brought to it.

Maybe thats why they specifically showed a clip from Age of Ultron this episode, to start making more solid connections to that movie.

Oh shit, Vision is gonna have to... fight... cloned Visions... just like Logans storyline. Well fuck, is there anything Marvel hasn't done"

But the short version of is: I was thinking of her overall killcount throughout her life. The hex could be like the Terragenesis on SHIELD where if you're normal and pass through it you turn to ashes and become new citizens of Westview. If you have the special dna then you get your powers and you become ~~citizens~~ visitors of Westview.

The shark says snacking on yo magic. The devils becoming stronger feeding off Wanda's magic. Her powers are clearly connected to her emotions so the stronger emotions the devil makes Wanda feel, the more energy she puts out the more he can feed. That's why he antagonized Wanda at the end about that dead husband comment.

Let’s say, since Thanos’s first snap happened, sending radiation across the Earth, then even more do after the Hulk and Iron Man snap."

CatProgrammer,1613153786.0,"> she managed to drive all the way out there

I think she was trying to do it within the boundaries of her role, which seems to give her some degree of flexibility (see also Herb, he's exhibited a greater degree of freedom in the past and this episode as well). She was acting out her ""driving to the town square"" thing, but really wanted to escape, and then ended up getting stuck at the end of town as she started to shut down. Kind of like how the doctor was going to ""go on vacation"" in an earlier episode but his car wouldn't start. I think Vision would have noticed if she was only pretending and not influenced in some way when he turned off the control and then turned it back on."

I can see Ant-Man helping start the Young Avengers spin off team on the west coast eventually, but for now the world feels pretty defensive-less. 

Doctor Strange seems like the only person available and capable of stepping up to the challenge and it’s likely he will show up before the show is over."

- Vision not knowing what The Avengers are when talking to Agnes, I mean he was formally became part of them at the end of Age of Ultron along Sam, Rhodey and Wanda, this is also really weird."

Islero47,1613153863.0,"I was thinking about that the other week, I don’t think they’ll ever mention COVID in the MCU because it probably didn’t exist. First there’s a 50/50 chance that human vector didn’t exist. Then there’s 50% fewer people sharing the same space, so we’re automatically more distanced and transmission is lower. And then even if it is spreading, people are already recognizing the value of every life and more likely to follow quarantining guidance so it runs out pretty quick, but I doubt it ever gets to that point."
Laigron,1613153864.0,But it could be a reverse thing. Hayward is villain and want something from Wanda and whole Hex is defense mechanism. Or something controling Wanda and Pietros memories and script is Real Wandas subconsciouness trying to snap her from it.

I think it's Dottie - she's the one that smashed the radio in Episode 2."

bellowingbullfinches,1613153898.0,"I was thinking more as a parallel to the scene at the end of Captain Marvel where Carol blasts Yon-Rogg.

It’s not so much about convincing someone; obviously at this point Hayward is beyond a nice chat about superheroes. It’s about shutting someone up who has maliciously attacked a number of people.

Have you forgotten that Hayward tried to kill Wanda *and her young children* with the drone strike? Or how malicious and cruel he was to invoke Monica’s mother when insulting her? You have to remember that it’s only been a few weeks since Monica learned Maria is dead, so that’s still a fresh wound. 

Hayward is arguably evil and may get even worse, especially with the reveal in this episode that he’s hiding something. They’ve heavily implied that he ordered the dissection and study of Vision, which is some Hydra-level evil.

So, no, I’m going to say that her blasting him off in the distance as a slap in the face wouldn’t take anything away from her being a superhero. Just like Stark isn’t evil because he blasted Sam after Rhodes fell in Civil War. Just like Carol isn’t a bad guy for blasting Yon-Rogg.

TooShyToSayILoveYou,1613154288.0,"Okay guys.

What if it's not Mephisto, it's Nightmare?

1. We know Nightmare is going to be involved in Doctor Strange 2.  And this series IS supposed to set up that show.
2. This entire show is basically Wanda trying to bring her dreams to life.
3. We know that Marvel likes to change things up between comics and movies. The kids being a part of Mephisto or a part of Nightmare, the end result of Wanda having to give them up will still be the same, won't it?

Hear me out, Nightmare made the hex for some reason. (Agnes is involved. I'll get to that.) Wanda found the place, and she discovers that she's got Moderator Permissions in this ""Maximoff Anamoly"" So she sets up shop, and brings Vision back. While she can control the place, she's not totally aware of the place. She couldn't sense who's leaving and coming in, for example. There's clearly someone with higher Admin perms, whom we haven't met yet.

And Agnes is in on this. She is acting WEIRD. Either she's the one who made the hex, or she's an agent of Nightmare.

For one thing, Agnes somehow knows exactly what problem the Maximoff household is having, and even comes with the right thing to solve their problem immediately. (As vision pointed out in the last episode) For another,  she was the only person who was talking and interacting that far away from the town center. Almost like that ""stay frozen when not in the shot of the sitcom"" spell doesn't affect her.  For another thing, she was acting weird even after being ""relieved of control"" by telling ""Dead. Dead. Dead"" and laughing like a maniac.  And when Vision puts her back, she should be back to that dazed state. But she went back to normal. Which shouldn't happen.  I have a feeling she was acting during that scene, to bait vision into leaving the hex."

Where I live, there was a family that was absolutely decimated by C19 - I believe 7 family members passed.  All of them between 50-70, with plenty of ""good years"" still left.  I can't even comprehend the grief in that situation. 

I think of another couple, in their early 30s... newly married couple.  Husband played college baseball.  Good looking young couple with their whole lives ahead of them.  Both got sick, wife made it, husband didn't.  Gone in three days.

So when I hear people saying ""oh, you're afraid"" or ""oh, you're a sheep""... I get rightfully angry.   We are *this fucking close* to solving this problem."
bellowingbullfinches,1613154410.0,"Captain Marvel was obnoxious in Endgame because she hasn’t been around long enough for the hero’s entrance they wrote for her. It’s like they were trying to recreate the magic of Thor arriving in Wakanda, but it just didn’t work.

I love the Carol Danvers character and can’t wait to see what they do with her, but they should’ve been way more restrained with her in Endgame. (I also blame Perlmutter for this as we should’ve gotten Captain Marvel in Phase 2.)

Showing Wanda tear apart the ship would’ve been amazing, but it would also be antithetical to her character. When she gets mad, she goes for the jugular. She wouldn’t go for his troops or his ship; the only option was to crush Thanos himself."

QwahaXahn,1613154537.0,"I don’t want anyone to misinterpret. I absolutely ADORE Carol—she’s been my favorite comic character since she showed up on Avengers: EMH. And I loved her solo movie.

But her individual comic runs tend to focus a lot more on interpersonal conflict. While she’s definitely powerful, her sheer level of strength doesn’t really get emphasized, because that’s not the point of her character.

I guess it just makes her feel a lot stronger in the MCU, even though she’s only a little bit boosted. Though, she definitely would require some serious energy absorption to reach the heights she did in Endgame, which is why I’m disappointed that they’ve erased her ability to strengthen herself with that power."

FlaccidPancakes_,1613154593.0,"Ok I’m not sure if anyone’s said anything about this I didn’t want to read like 10k comments/threads but it’s about the frozen people right. All of the people were just frozen and I think it’s because Vision lied. They kinda focused when the dude (I forget his name) told Wanda he didn’t go to work. So I think that because Wanda had no idea where Vision was she didn’t know what to “animate”. But Agnes was the only one still “working” she was muttering which was extremely strange. She was also the only one who specifically said Wanda was the one doing this to anyone. It’s obvious that she knows more than everyone else. She doesn’t have an identity yet, what I just said, and the witch or mephisto or something made Wandas children who turned out to be demons and Pietro said “run you little demon spawns”. Thoughts?"
CatProgrammer,1613154598.0,Strawberry.
wokatondu,1613154601.0,"All my predictions based on this episode:

*Pietro isn't the Fox X-men Quicksilver. He's Mephisto. He has merely assumed the body of Fox X-men Quicksilver because it was probably alive in the multiverse. The Aaron Taylor Quicksilver body is decayed beyond use.

*The twins are real and Mephisto is the father. Hence, the ""Demon spawn"" reference. It also references the incestuous relationship between Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver in the comics. It's also why one twin has superspeed like Pietro and the other has mind powers like Wanda. Pietro also encourages and participates in screwing up Halloween decorations and stealing candies; the harmless mischief.

*Mephisto isn't working alone. He's allies with Nightmare. Hayward says to Monica that ""we take out Wanda and this whole nightmare ends"". Nightmare is working with Mephisto  (and possibly Agatha) to enter MCU universe or some other evil shit.

*The series will end with the multiverse opening and leading into Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness, where Nightmare will be the villain. Wanda will be responsible. This is also how Spiderman 3 will have Raimi and Marc Webb Spiderman characters entering MCU. We might also see a cameo by the actual Fox X-men Quicksilver. Mutants might find their origin in MCU somewhere as all this shit goes down.

*This one could be me reaching too far but maybe this series connects to Loki series as well. Quicksilver, at one point, holds a red and green can of foam or something. I saw this representing as two ""devils"" or mischiefmakers of MCU - Loki and Mephisto."

For example, in the first episode we saw Mrs. Hart crying for Wanda to save her husband - or at least to stop choking her. 

Herb seemed to have something to tell Vision yet he didn't. 

Monica remembered Pietro and seemed to come off line for a moment before Wanda yeeted her out of the Hex. 

The mailman made that off handed remark about Wanda controlling things in front of her kids. 

Even Vision seems to have some kind of awareness of how strange everything is.

Obviously now's there's the potentially villainous Evan Peters and his rendition of Quicksilver.

DefectiveShoelace,1613154901.0,"I liked what they were going for with them, but felt things went too quickly or too much happened off-screen for me to ever really get to know them like the others, especially Vision as I don't think he was ever given much to do to begin with. In AoU he's ""born"" and we get that really good scene with Ultron at the end, in Civil War we see him start to express feelings for Wanda and being conflicted in the Sokovia Accords, then they're in love in Infinity War and she has to sacrifice him. It's why despite that being a sad scene, and obviously didn't want it to happen, it didn't feel as emotional to me as it should have since it was a character I still felt like I didn't get to know much of, whereas this one now that they developed him more made me way more emotional.

It just feels like imo they got the short end of the stick due to time in each of those films, though they did try. We never really got any scenes for his character to shine or for his personality to really be seen, whereas in this show he's able to finally show some real emotion and what his personality is, same with Wanda, though I suppose it could also be because he's not technically the ""normal"" Vision rn.

I liked the characters and I wanted to see them get the spotlight and develop more which is why I watched the show, and i'm really happy that it's managed to make me love them both even more now as a result. I just think it's a shame it finally happened, in Bettany's case, right at the end of his portrayal seemingly if his character stays dead."
WafflesDaddy1981,1613154903.0,"Because Evan Peters was one of the only good things from the Xmen movies and also recasting a role is a HUGE sitcom trope especially in the 90s.

I wish they’d expanded on that a bit more because I think that makes Hayward very compelling if they give him a true reason for not believing in heroes anymore, but they’ve decided to make him the average “Let’s just kill ‘em” guy."

Just after the commercial, Agness goads Vision into leaving the hex, then Wanda blasts Pietro, and finally she expands the hex. This would all ""feed"" whatever entity is doing this to her. 

I should probably add that I think Agatha is/was key to getting Wanda to do all of this, but is now herself succumbing to Wanda's powers or maybe her amulet gives some level of protection or control inside the hex."

Knightgee,1613155298.0,"Some observations:

The outskirts of town seem to be less active but just as controlled. Everyone's in stasis as they are basically background extras on the show who only exist to pad out the town and keep up the appearance that it's all real. But when you pay attention you see folks are on loops or in some cases downright not doing anything. 

&#x200B;

This raises a question though. Agnes isn't a background extra. She seems pretty important to the ""show"". Heck she even made it into the opening credits this episode. So why was she on the outskirts instead of the town square? Was she trying to leave and stalled out like a broken NPC the further she got from Wanda? But she even says herself Wanda forbids them even thinking about leaving, so was she doing it subconsciously or what? Also she wasn't unresponsive like the rest of the people so close to the barrier. She was able to respond to Vision, it was just mostly gibberish until he woke her up."
KOPBrewHouse,1613155309.0,"My issue with him being Pietro from another universe is why would he look like a different person? I mean most alternate reality fiction if you go to another reality the alternate you still looks like you. It's also weird to think that this all powerful being who's in control of everything seemingly needed to pick a quicksilver from another universe that looks nothing like her brother, and convince her it's her brother. If they could do that, why not just pull any person and make them do that. Apparently someone's allowing vision to keep his super powers they can certainly give those to any random person."

And yet, Scarlett Witch held him back while destorying an Infinity Stone. And then later, went 1v1 and forced Thanks to go all Pyrrhus of Ephesus and destroy his own forces just to stop her from literally ripping him apart after he had just been going to town on Cap with Mjoilnir, Iron Man, and Stormbreaker Thor.

Kyle XY to the MCU CONFIRMED"
kaptingavrin,1613155791.0,"> Rey was too powerful from the onset of her abilities and breezed through any challenge. She attacks and beats Luke Skywalker for doing evil and ""creating Kylo Ren"".

First off, Rey is basically just Luke 2.0.  The farm boy who hops in a military craft he has no training in and fires a perfect shot with the Force to blow up a huge threat, while being the only pilot not to get hit by Vader, after going through a massive military installation fighting trained soldiers who he easily beat.  It's a trope.  If you hate it, hate it with Luke, too.  They did establish some of what she could do, i.e. she learned to fight with a staff for defense (makes sense given she was a scavenger), so she knows how to use a melee weapon, and only beats Kylo Ren after he's been shot in the torso and already had to fight a guy who was trained in the use of melee weapons (again, a lightsaber's just a sword), all while Kylo doesn't want to kill her but she's giving in to anger and has no qualms about trying to kill him.  In The Last Jedi, it even shows her messing up and slicing through a rock, Luke straight up says Ben (you know, a male character) is on the same power level, and she ""beats"" Luke because he isn't really trying to fight... but Luke, not Rey, is the one who stops the First Order assault so the Resistance can escape.  People can take issue with Rey moving all those rocks, but remember that Yoda told Luke it's not that hard, Jedi in the prequels moved things with ease, and Rey went into the training believing stories of Jedi doing impressive things so was more receptive to Luke teaching her ""Size doesn't matter, just reach out in the Force and move it.""  He did a good job teaching her.

> Wonder Woman was too powerful from birth and breezed through any challenge, easily defeating a god once she realizes the power of love. The 2nd movie was rife with creepy men lingering the streets and malls, who eventually get beaten up by her or Cheetah.

So you also hate Superman?  Aquaman?  Batman?  Or are they getting a pass?  Especially Superman who is ""too powerful from birth and breezed through any challenge.""  Wonder Woman is a superhuman who ends up fighting a lot of regular people, of course she's going to beat them.  The ""god"" wasn't some omnipotent being, either.  As for the 2nd movie, there were a couple of scenes, and if you have a problem with them showing situations that are unfortunately too common in real life, then don't bitch at them for being ""anti-men,"" bitch at the sorry excuses of male humans (that I refuse to call men) who do that shit.

> Ocean's 8,

You're just really reaching here.  Ocean's 8 isn't about women vs. men.  It's literally just Ocean's 11 but with women.  If you think the women were too good, then hate on the men in O11 as well.  But if the protagonists in those movies couldn't succeed in the heists, people would hate the movies.

> Ghostbusters,

This is the only one that's legit to criticize.  And it's a conscious choice the director made.  Whereas every other example you tried to give is a cringe-inducing example of an insecure guy whining about the idea of a movie where women do the same things guys do in so many more movies and doesn't even remotely have any ""men vs. women"" situation, GB2016 straight up tried to play on that situation thinking it'd help deflect criticism of the fact they made a bad movie while attempting to do a ""reboot"" that was just a horribly done copy of the original that somehow missed all of the stuff that made the original entertaining.  A competent person in charge could have come in, used the line about ""franchises"" in the first GB movie to set up the idea of GB teams around the country (or world), used that to introduce an all-women team while still in the same continuity, and just found a good story to tell involving them.

> Charlie's Angels

Haven't watched the latest, but I have a feeling it's another hilarious reach here based on the whole ""men are victims"" mentality that you're copying from the more useless corners of YouTube and the Internet.  I mean, if they didn't wildly change the story, they take their instructions from a guy, hence the name **Charlie's** Angels.  I am mildly interested, so I might watch it later, but I suspect the ""problem"" with it is that it has female protagonists.

Oh, and before you attempt to use any lame remarks on me: I'm a man, I'm not liberal (unless you're hardcore ""conservative,"" but then hardcore ""liberal"" people call me conservative, so eh), I hate movies that actually do that crap like GB2016.  But I also loathe people who bitch that any movie with women protagonists is some kind of men-hating propaganda.  It's so insanely stupid that I can feel brain cells screaming in pain whenever I hear or read that nonsense."

Feeling-Confusion-,1613155852.0,"Anyone notice how we didn't hear the audience anymore? There was no laughing or different camera angles. Its changed almost back to first person as Wanda/outsider watching rather than the TV show. Also no credits because she moved the barrier but it almost looked like the twins were not affected and frozen.

Wanda is having slip ups. I'm wondering if vision touches his own temples to access/release his brain (like he did his coworker and Agnes) and remembers everything. Thus leading to him ans Wanda having to fight because it's time to let go. He always had to coach her even when it was time for him to die the first time and this would be their last big moment, but she could finally gain some closure ans they could say their goodbyes properly and she'd be left with beautiful memories not thanos ripping out visions stone.

Also why was Agnes the only ""extra"" or ""character"" that was frozen but still conscious and able to respond to vision, under Wanda's spell or not? I agree with the theory that her role is more important than we are being led to believe. What was she doing on the edge of town, but still conscious?

Seriously why is Pietro AN XMEN like. Who is Monica's ""guy"" that can help and she is going to pick up? She specified it was a man. Ant Man, Dr. Strange? I'm not familiar with the comics and she knows Cpt. Marvel so who would she have access to?"

That kind of story works well in a series, but movies have to push a story in two hours and people want action in a comic book movie, so it limits the time you get for things like interpersonal conflict.

As Vision points out, the Town Square Scare is very obviously in the town square based off the name, and he's surprised she ""took a wrong turn"" and got lost in the town she ""grew up in"". There's enough other weird stuff going on that he doesn't really dwell on it.

WordsOfRadiants,1613156906.0,"> First off, Rey is basically just Luke 2.0.  The farm boy who hops in a  military craft he has no training in and fires a perfect shot with the  Force to blow up a huge threat, while being the only pilot not to get  hit by Vader, after going through a massive military installation  fighting trained soldiers who he easily beat.  It's a trope.  If you  hate it, hate it with Luke, too.  They did establish some of what she  could do, i.e. she learned to fight with a staff for defense (makes  sense given she was a scavenger), so she knows how to use a melee  weapon, and only beats Kylo Ren after he's been shot in the torso and  already had to fight a guy who was trained in the use of melee weapons  (again, a lightsaber's just a sword), all while Kylo doesn't want to  kill her but she's giving in to anger and has no qualms about trying to  kill him.  In The Last Jedi, it even shows her messing up and slicing  through a rock, Luke straight up says Ben (you know, a male character)  is on the same power level, and she ""beats"" Luke because he isn't really  trying to fight... but Luke, not Rey, is the one who stops the First  Order assault so the Resistance can escape.  People can take issue with  Rey moving all those rocks, but remember that Yoda told Luke it's not  that hard, Jedi in the prequels moved things with ease, and Rey went  into the training believing stories of Jedi doing impressive things so  was more receptive to Luke teaching her ""Size doesn't matter, just reach  out in the Force and move it.""  He did a good job teaching her. 

Sure, Gary Sues exist, and many people have ridiculed the one shot one kill on the Death Star, but sure, pretend like other people don't have issues with that just so you can have zero issues with Rey the Mary Sue. 

A staff does not translate to a light saber. Hell, swords don't translate to light sabers because the balance is entirely different. 

She beat Kylo Ren in force. She, who hadn't barely begun to feel the force, beat someone who was almost fully trained in it. Someone who also happened to be powerful enough to scare Luke Skywalker. 

Again, a lightsaber is not a sword. 

LOL, she messed up and sliced through a rock? That's your idea of a challenge? She sliced through a rock? C'mon man. She literally beats Luke Skywalker not long after that, which is complete bullshit. 

Yoda's feat with moving a spacecraft was considered an incredible feat of Force. Rey lifts what could be the same weight, except it's in multiple pieces, so if anything it was a greater feat. She, who had little training was outdoing one of the greatest masters in the Force in the entire universe.

Luke might have been a bit of a Gary Sue because all Chosen One fantasies tend to lean towards power fantasies, but he trained longer, he didn't defeat masters right off the bat, faced more hardships, and failed often. Rey faced nothing that really challenged her. She beat Kylo Ren, she beat the imperial guards, she beat Luke Skywalker, she fixes ships, she flies extremely well, she killed Palpatine, and all with basically no training."

arcaidairman,1613157011.0,"Here is my MCU Mutants theory. I'm positive that Wanda and Pietro are the first MCU mutants and that the mind stone was the catalyst for their x-gene. And now through the hexagon radiation, she is awakening the x-gen in everyone who comes in contact with her cells mutating powers. And this taking place weeks after Endgame and Far From Home being set months after the last Avengers movie, can be explained by saying that only people surrounding New Jersey were affected and they would start to carry that radiation and spread it like virus. (The way ultimate comics tackled the origins of the mutants).

Now this narative can be used in a more relatable direction for the audience who just experience a virus themselves and Marvel can call this event the **Mutant Pandemic** creating that alienating feeling between humans and mutants as we had experienced between each-other all this time because of the fear of getting infected. This will also give Marvel a chance to expend and get political and address some modern themes (as the main reason X-Men were created at the time was to fight against racism and support the racial equality) and use Magneto as leader of a Homo-Superior supremacist group making people afraid of mutants by calling them terrorists; ruining the image of mutants as a whole and this mirroring the way we see and fear emigrants today. 

And guessing that in the end this will play out as being the conflict of X-Men vs Avengers standing as a Civil War II."

None of the other family members had character names. They just listed the names of the people (such as “Wanda Maximoff”).

Perhaps this is a clue that the Pietro we see is in fact an actor and not the real Pietro, which is also supported by the fact he obviously looks different, doesn’t have Pietro’s memories, and knows things that the real Pietro couldn’t."

FrameworkisDigimon,1613157366.0,">They very VERY clearly mentioned that crossing the Hex was lit-rally rewriting Rambeau's genetic code...as in mutating it...

How can I put this politely... if what is described in Episode 6 makes you think ""mutant"" you do not understand what the term mutant means in Marvel. No ifs, no buts. You're just wrong.

If you further think you can carry the mutant metaphor using m u t a t e s like Reed, Monica and Peter, you haven't stopped to think about it. How can mutants be a distinct category of analysis if we're accepting Reed, Monica, Bruce, Peter and so on as mutants when they're just not? Well, we can't.

But I must stress that this shit is so fucking basic, I have absolutely no interesting in being polite. Don't try and ""correct"" people from a position of ignorance that a ten second perusal of Wikipedia will set you straight on (see below).

This has fuck all to do with mutants.

In the comics, these characters are called m u t a t e s. Rewritten DNA has nothing to do with mutants whatsoever. The whole fucking point is that their DNA doesn't *need* re-writing. Think for a single bloody minute. If their DNA needs to be rewritten to have powers, they aren't fucking mutants.

What is described is precisely what happens with Bruce, Steve, Peter or the Fantastic Four.

Don't believe me?

>Unlike Marvel's mutates, which are characters who develop their powers only after exposure to outside stimuli or energies (such as the Hulk, Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, Absorbing Man and Captain Marvel), mutants have actual genetic mutations.

That's Wikipedia.

WordsOfRadiants,1613157755.0,"> So you also hate Superman?  Aquaman?  Batman?  Or are they getting a  pass?  Especially Superman who is ""too powerful from birth and breezed  through any challenge.""  Wonder Woman is a superhuman who ends up  fighting a lot of regular people, of course she's going to beat them.   The ""god"" wasn't some omnipotent being, either.  As for the 2nd movie,  there were a couple of scenes, and if you have a problem with them  showing situations that are unfortunately too common in real life, then  don't bitch at them for being ""anti-men,"" bitch at the sorry excuses of  male humans (that I refuse to call men) who do that shit. 

Superman gets his shit kicked in pretty hard. He even loses to Batman. But yeah, people, including me, didn't like how he basically solved all the problems in the Justice League movie. Aquaman gets his shit kicked in pretty hard by his brother. Batman is human, so that's his biggest weakness. He bleeds, he gets knocked down, he gets back up. 

The issue with the Wonder Woman movies, is that there Isn't any real conflict. Having a superhuman fighting a lot of regular people =/= conflict. The ""god"" was Ares, who is higher up on the divinity ladder than Diana. Yet, she makes one little change and wipes the floor with him.

Oh, yeah, there are just tons of guy rapists on the streets just lurching about grabbing women as they pass, attempt to rape them, and then go back to standing drunk on nearby street corners night after night. The problem is that you're a misandrist. And yes, men can hate men. You see no issue with constantly portraying men like they're rapey villains who live just to creep on and grope girls, because you think that's what they're all like. 

Oh, and Diana straight up rapes the dude Steve inhabits in the 2nd movie. But I'm guessing you're okay with that, right?"

ouradventuringparty,1613157854.0,"Ok I have two rather boring points about your 2nd and 3rd predictions:

""Mephisto is the father"". No. For one reason, Disney would not touch incest or non-consensual relationships with a ten foot barge pole. Vision is Wanda's love interest so for Mephisto to be the father, there would be some non-consensual action here, which is a hot topic that Disney will avoid at all costs to maintain their brand. And incest is a taboo, that again Disney won't go near for the same reason. 

""Mephisto isn't working alone"". I highly doubt there are multiple villains in this series. We are 6 episodes in of a 9 episode series (rumours of a 10th doesn't alter my viewpoint). There isn't the scope of time really available to introduce multiple villians. I know that the episodes are not the same length, bit we would need a lot more time to introduce multiple villians, explain their purpose and their motives on top of explaining what Wanda is doing, why Hayward is an arse, and bringing the story to a complete conclusion. Frankly, if we've not seen Mephisto by the end of episode 7, I'll be willing to bet he isn't coming at all and it's just a massive red herring we've thrown at ourselves."

Art_drunk,1613157931.0,"But look at what he does know. Everything he knows about this universe’s Pietro is what would be common knowledge to anyone who was following the actions/events of the avengers. Nothing of his own life... his own *parents* who are not dead (or at least we know his dad is still alive), and nothing about his *sisters*.  He does know an awful lot about what’s going on in the Hex, and what Wanda is doing to the people in it. Wanda even asks him if he thinks what she is doing is really ok. Nobody else, not even Vision knows what Wanda has been doing, and yet Pietro knows... and doesn’t judge? One thing about the MCU Peter Maximoff is that while he’s got a sense of humor, he does care about people and will try to save them if he can. Wandavision Peter doesn’t seem to care about the people in Westview, what’s happening to them or their fates. 

I don’t think he is Peter from X-Men or Pietro with the face of Peter. He’s something else entirely, and he has been trying to manipulate Wanda from the beginning. Wanda didn’t create him, he just used the kid’s suggestion to appear and get close enough to Wanda to answer his questions about how she is doing certain things and manipulate her further. Also Wanda can’t control this Pietro, no more than she can control her children. That is significant.

Lol the movie includes the line ""a 'him' gets noticed, a 'her' gets ignored'. That's not even true. It's ugly/average looking people that gets ignored. And the plot was about Debbie Ocean getting revenge on her male partner, and for no fucking reason, Anne Hathaway's character betrays him to join the girls, cause 'sisterhood'.

I'm guessing he's the puppetmaster behind the scenes (Mephisto or someone else). He decided to get close to Wanda to keep a more personal hand on the situation, and he dodged her ""test"" because he's not Pietro. Perhaps he doesn't even know exactly how Pietro died (his description was lacking). And his questions to her were trying to figure out how much she knew about his involvement (eg nothing).

Whereas every other example you tried to give is a cringe-inducing example of an insecure guy whining about the idea of a movie where women do the same things guys do in so many more movies and doesn't even remotely have any ""men vs. women"" situation, GB2016 straight up tried to play on that situation thinking it'd help deflect criticism of the fact they made a bad movie while attempting to do a ""reboot"" that was just a horribly done copy of the original that somehow missed all of the stuff that made the original entertaining.  A competent person in charge could have come in, used the line about ""franchises"" in the first GB movie to set up the idea of GB teams around the country (or world), used that to introduce an all-women team while still in the same continuity, and just found a good story to tell involving them.

Your misandry is showing through again. Of course, any criticism about a female-led film is just ""an insecure guy whining"". Nevermind that movies where the same shit happens with a male lead also gets criticized. No, no, you have to display the misandry and dismiss it as male insecurity.

Ghostbusters isn't even the most egregious on this list. The worst on this list is easily Charlie's Angels, followed by Ocean's 8. GB wasn't a good film for the same reasons as the others on the list: no real challenges. 

But it's important to note that just because it's not a good film, it doesn't mean you can't enjoy it. I actually did enjoy the movie, cause the cast interacted in a fun way."

MattTheSmithers,1613158726.0,"Crazy theory. Maybe just baked but the switch to letter box when showing the real world hit me hard just now. 

A lot of us have been wondering when Woo/Rambo/Darcy will be going into the Hex. I submit to you, they already are.  The outside of the Hex is a show in and of itself. 

Just as Wanda has created a reality for herself based on classic family comedies, she’s created a mid-aughts serialized drama for those sent in to stop her. When you think about it, all the beats being followed are basically a list of cliche tropes pulled straight from the likes of 24. The stupidly adversarial bureaucrat who only seems to exist to illogically wrap up the hero in red tape; the mole who is hiding something nefarious; the hero going rogue; the letter box format; the silly cyber-technobabble to explain away any problem; the semi-contrived appearances of classic characters and so on and so forth.

The explosion was caused by a Hydra suicide bomber. Blaming it on superpowered people is ass-backwards.

Also, why Evan Peter's quicksilver?  I'm sure whoever's behind this didn't just create a random Quicksilver that just so happened to be the Fox Universe Quicksilver.  Too much of a coincidence to happen.  Someone with multi-universal powers is pulling strings in the background of WandaVision if Evan Peter's showed up.

And where the hell has Dottie been ever since the little fundraiser meeting?  She's apparently the key to everything in this town as mentioned by Agnes earlier which to me implies that maybe Wanda is controlling the life SHE HAS, but someone else is controlling everything else.

Nice editorializing. Of course you're trying to frame it as ""victim mentality"" when it's pointed out that men are portrayed in purposely unflattering ways. You simultaneously blamed men for it, and claim it's nothing but a victim mentality, while you call men useless lol. Just all sorts of misandrist hypocrisy up in you huh?

You think it's Elizabeth Banks at first, but nope, psych, of course it's the man. The guys are all evil, except for one, who dies.

After which Wanda depowered all but 198. 

Even in the sense that mutants are persecuted and discriminated against, you couldn't have anywhere close to that many of them, cause 50% of a population isn't a minority. Mutants were an analogue for queer/LGBT people, 4-5% of the population being mutants is a sensible amount."

Art_drunk,1613159623.0,"They never did explain how humans figured out how to use the mind stone to do... anything, let alone active Wanda’s and Pietro’s powers. 

Stupid theory, but according to Marvel comics, Wanda is a [nexus being](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Nexus_Beings) and so is Vision, which means they are the same person across the multiverse. There’s no alternate versions of her, or Vision, like there would be of other beings. How she got her powers in the comics is a long story but there was a celestial type elder god being involved with giving her the ability to use chaos magic on top of her mutual powers.  

The marvel universe in the movies hasn’t talked about mutants, but spin off shows kinda have (agents of shield and the Netflix shows) but because of licensing reasons with Fox they couldn’t use that term until now. I wonder if those shows started in the same universe but at one point diverged and are now in a different branch of the timeline... that would let them explain why they could re-write some origin stories... sorry getting off track.  I’m just trying to sus out why Pietro’s powers were also activated. The elder god being didn’t mess with his abilities in the comics.

Point is, who ever is manipulating Wanda now, to have kids and stay in this pocket reality, may also be responsible for her OP powers in the first place. We might get a direct link to this show and whatever happened in that hydra base, and Wanda may begin to gain an understanding of how powerful she actually is."

I’m sure you think you just proved some kind of point, but you’ve missed mine entirely.

Yes, any superhero movie breaks the laws of physics, but the good ones don’t break any more than they have to to tell their story.  Sure, the MCU breaks lots of laws of physics, but when the big breaks come, generally they either hang a lantern on the scene or they’ve built enough story around it to make it work within the bounds of earlier infractions.

Superman can fly.  Yes, that breaks the laws of physics, but it takes some dramatic leaps and bounds to say him flying around the Earth backwards can turn back time.

Disliking a scene and pointing out one of the many reasons why I dislike it doesn’t always have to turn into a double digit comment thread criticizing the initial criticism.  Everyone could have been like “you didn’t like the scenes, oh well, your loss” but in true Internet fashion everyone made sure to tell me that I’m wrong, tell me why I’m wrong, and tell me why I am someway inferior to them for having a unique opinion on a couple scenes from superhero movies. 

I’d mention a few scenes from MCU that I think are gimmicky or rule breaking, to show I’m an equal opportunity critic, but given the crowd that reads all the way through this thread, I’d probably just get downvoted for those opinions too."

The_MAZZTer,1613159725.0,"Agnes seems to have a bit more control than others, or could be because she is farthest away from Wanda.

Agnes also seems to not be collaborating with Wanda, based on her conversation with Vision. She straight up tells him he's an Avenger and should be dead. Plus Wanda doesn't remember collaborating with anyone.

Also, Agnes claims she got lost. Vision claims she grew up in Westview (in the sitcom reality). I think she is from outside and really did get lost; Wanda does not control them that precisely. She's more like a director, and they are actors who have some flexibility in how they play the role as long as they stick to the script.

Also Agnes does a u-turn once restored, and she was on a street at the border of Westview. Possibly she was trying to escape, though it sounds like that's impossible. Maybe she did get lost, and Wanda stopped her from going further and accidentally leaving Westview without actually intending to."

Or, it's possible she does not want the Westview charade to continue which is why she is telling Vision things that will get him to investigate further. After all in Episode 3 it seems she is quite afraid of Wanda; Agnes no longer as much control over the situation."

sportsdude523,1613159947.0,"Wanda, Vision, Pietro, and Heyward are strong characters.

Rambeau, computer girl, and Jimmy Woo are not. There's just something so childish and not believable about them and the stunt they pulled after Heyward kicked them off. Especially computer girl. Her screaming that vision just needs help as he crawls out the hex just feels like the actions of a five year old.

Rambeau going ""I'm just going to drive in and talk to Wanda about her feelings to settle this"". Seriously? There is no plan. There is no cunning. She has a misplaced arrogant confidence about this irrational plan.  There is not a deep enough emotional connection between wanda and rambeau for this to sound like a convincing action that's been thought out. No build up to them meeting up and seeing how Wanda will react. It's just a part of the plot just to be part of the plot.

They are a foil to Heyward. Heyward's reasonings for his attitude towards Wanda are understandable, although it's recognizable that he is projecting some level of personal hatred that we will find out more on later I'm guessing. The other 3 are just an incredibly irrational opposite extreme of ""have compassion and understanding for human beings and just give a chance to her and it will work like kumbia!"" kids movie trope. Sure they can have that attituide to an extent, but I don't see any rational nuance to that attitude where it's cautious compassion where they are ready to kill Wanda for the greater good if the threat grows too immense as well as attempt to be understanding."
Mobile-Importance-74,1613159947.0,I guess you could ask the question but I think the simpler answer is he doesn’t know the events of Infinity War but rather that Vision is dead now.  “Can’t kill a corpse” is probably more likely than another connection back to Infinity War

Pietro makes since as he's not Pietro. He never answers Wanda's questions, just keeps reminding Wanda of stuff.

Wanda seems to not totally be all there. Clint might be there to comfort her but I don't see her being buddy buddy with his kids like Natasha was. 

I think there is an overestimation of Clints importance.

Vision I think is alive but only within the Hex and he's basically a blank.

It's easy to group decades as defining eras, but in reality, culture usually shifts on the half decades. Early 90s was closer to what we think of as the 80s, for example, and the late 90s paved the way for the turn of the Millennium. This fills that 95-05 era pretty perfectly."

Tactful,1613160198.0,"100% agree. X-Men Quicksilver has story-breaking OP powers. The only way you could counter that is by nerfing him which is boring as hell.

Like many people I enjoyed the ""everything is slow motion but Quicksilver"" scenes, especially the first one.

He could solve every problem that happens instantly, unless you write a reason for him to fail (oh no, they have a special anti-speed crystal! etc)."

WordsOfRadiants,1613160247.0,">Oh, and before you attempt to use any lame remarks on me: I'm a man, I'm not liberal (unless you're hardcore ""conservative,"" but then hardcore ""liberal"" people call me conservative, so eh), I hate movies that actually do that crap like GB2016.  But I also loathe people who bitch that any movie with women protagonists is some kind of men-hating propaganda.  It's so insanely stupid that I can feel brain cells screaming in pain whenever I hear or read that nonsense.

Well, I actually am a liberal, and I don't hate any of the movies I listed, except for TLJ, but that doesn't have to do with Rey. I do have a strong dislike for O8 though, but that's because of how ridiculously boring it was. 

I, unlike you, just don't harbor a ton of hate for men, so I'm not biased against seeing misandry where it exists. I'm also not biased against seeing misogyny where it exists. 

Like I said, it's a visible trend with Hollywood where they purposefully fill the female-led movies with detestable men for the female protagonists to knock down. I'm not saying there's anything wrong with male villains, or with female protagonists defeating them, but it's with the way the male villains are portrayed or what is justified against them for tiny transgressions. If Superman nearly broke a guy's hand and stole his clothes and motorcycle for telling Supes to smile, plenty of people will have issues with that too. 

Hell, Supes got a ton of flak for causing too much destruction throughout the city fighting with another god-like being  because it was too unlike his moral and upright character. That, I didn't agree with, cause c'mon, how could he not against Zod, but I, and many others, had a lot of issues with him abandoning his father to the tornado. Cause what the fuck was that?

The part about many of the female protagonists being Mary Sues just has to do with how boring the characters are written. Wonder Woman is meant to be powerful, like Superman, yes, so she's not a Mary Sue because she's powerful. The issue with her stories is that she isn't really challenged by what she faces. It seems that the only thing that challenges her in her stories are her emotions of love, which is just not a fun conflict to watch imo. 

I do get that there Are a lot of misogynistic idiots out there using these movies as excuses to bash women creators and actresses, so I won't fault you too much for coming out swinging with that accusation, but misandry Does also exist. Movies setting up shitty male antagonists for female protagonists to effortlessly knock down do exist. Just like it's okay for Russians and Germans to not like movies portraying them as cartoony villains, it's alright for men to not like movies portraying Them as cartoony villains."

I think it was trying to pass through Wanda's magic itself that was killing him. We saw Wanda put an extra layer of magic on the dome after the drone, presumably so things couldn't get in. It probably stops things from getting out too.

When Vision is passing through, he's struggling against a thin film of residual magic that he just can't get past. And in the commercial, the kid died *because he couldn't break the seal of the (yo-)magic*

I think Vision can exist outside the hex, but it was Wanda herself inadvertently killing him."

There's no reason why the idea that Wanda keeps them from escaping is valid. It's possible this idea started after the doctor in episode 3 tried to go on vacation, but his car conveniently died once Wanda found out about it. They might have been trying to flee the town within the constrictions of Wanda's sitcom before she put a stop to it.

Agnes may have been purposefully telling Vision the truth; the whole situation is out of her control now, so she is pushing Vision who she thinks is the only one who can end this. Why lie when the truth will work fine? She does seem to ham it up with the laughter.

On the other hand, Agnes happened to get lost at the border of Westview. Quite a coincidence. Once she seems to go back under Wanda's control, she makes a u-turn, going back toward the center of town."

Of course the cat is out the bag now, there’s no stopping extraterrestrial threats, but Zemo and Hayward may not see it that way. They naturally want the events that happened to never happen again, basically to not be pawns and chattel when super powered beings fight. I mean, given what has happened since the first Marvel movie, millions of bystanders lives were probably ruined. So, that doesn’t make their motivations “evil”, just in conflict with that of the superheroes.

I think this is a good sign we will see more complex antagonists, which given who they haven’t brought in yet, like Dr Doom for example, I think is excellent"

bobsta98,1613160849.0,"Crazy Theory time: SWORD is moving towards robotics and artificial intelligence (most likely as a result of studying Vision's corpse). WandaVision features one mutant (Quicksilver from the X-Men timeline) and 3 characters who are mutants in the comics (Scarlet Witch, Speed and Wiccan). Director Hayward expresses his dislike for powered individuals and is desperate to retrieve Vision. What's to say that all the events leading to the Sokovia Accords, plus half the world dying then being resurrected as a result of the Avenger's actions, plus Wanda kidnapping an entire town, plus Quicksilver leading the way for more mutants to come into the MCU, doesn't end up with Hayward enlisting the help of Bolivar Trask to use their research on Vision to create machines to hunt down and destroy super powered individuals: The Sentinels."

The_MAZZTer,1613160915.0,"Yup, I am now on board that train.

Evidence:

* Wanda knows it's Pietro somehow even though he looks different, and she seems genuinely surprised to see him. This suggest she's being manipulated into seeing him as Pietro.
* Pietro stays close to Wanda, even if it means letting Vision wander around where he'll discover things he's not supposed to.
* Pietro says he was shot in the streets and then woke up with her. That's something anyone who reads MCU Wikipedia would get. Nothing about dying saving Hawkeye's life and making a snarky comment.
* He dodges her ""test"" and doesn't actually answer it. Both her question about the past and why he looks different.
* He knows about the children being missing, if he really arrived at the end of episode 5, he wouldn't. He was sneaking around out of sight earlier to know this.
* He knows Vision should be dead. Real Pietro was long dead by the time those events played out so he shouldn't know that.

That said he claims to remember Halloween in Sokovia, though Wanda claims she remembers it differently. Suggesting alternate reality Pietro maybe?

My idea is the kids are here so he is trying to get close to them, and the identity of Pietro provides a good way to do this. He checks to see if Wanda has figured anything out by asking her about what she has done to Westview, and, ciritcally, how it all started. She doesn't know how it started, which means his involvement is still unknown to her."

And it's hard for Wanda to completely fill the holes of a totally changed personality, so Vision and Pietro are more aware of what's happening."

This episode doesn't rule out any of these and actually leaves behind evidence for all of them.

Its not clear what affect the altered barrier has. I assumed the effect on Vision was because he was different from the others that have passed through the barrier. And Wanda passed through the altered barrier just fine (but then again she's Wanda). That said we only have the one data point so it's possible what you said is what they were going for; it would make for a nice irony that Wanda was indirectly responsible for that."

Ok so we see in this episode how going through the hex is ""rewriting"" Monica Rambeau's DNA, and at the end of this episode Wanda starts expanding the field around Westview and several people go through, including Darcy. 

I believe that those people who go through the hex are going to be some of the first mutants. Maybe she will expand it even further and people all over the world go through, or maybe the first mutants will just be the people who have already gone through.

It's possible that as their DNA is changed, it adds in the X gene. Maybe if she expands it to a world wide level, only a certain amount of people develop the X gene (5-10%?) this may cause other people in the world to fear these mutants, which sets up the issue of Mutants being feared and oppressed and set up the fight for mutant civil rights in the MCU."

Also Mephisto is tricking everyone in town, including Vision and Agnes, into thinking that Wanda created this, so that she believes it, hence the attack at the border.

Basically, Mephisto is pitting Wanda against SWORD and everyone of the hostages thinks she started this and is afraid of her. The Agnes character not being identified yet has to be a misdirect, she is also being used to trick Wanda."

> Location shooting took place in the Atlanta metropolitan area throughout December 2019 and February 2020. A filming wrap party for the series occurred on March 1, ahead of a planned four-week hiatus, but all production halted on March 14 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Filming resumed in Los Angeles in September 2020 with rigorous COVID-19 safety protocols in place, to complete the backlot and outside filming necessary for the series. Olsen found it hard resuming production after being isolated during the shutdown, while Bettany disliked that the safety protocols meant the actors had to return to their trailers when not filming, which he felt removed much of the camaraderie between the cast and crew. Filming took place on Blondie Street at the Warner Bros. Ranch in Burbank, California, where past sitcoms had also been filmed. Shakman felt the Blondie Street backlot had ""that weird sense of fakeness"" that no real-life street could replicate. Production on the series wrapped by mid-November, with Olsen shooting back-to-back with Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness."

Like fish use gills to get oxygen, we use lungs.

And if every planet they visit is or was once a populated planet, it would likely have an atmosphere that would support life similar to on earth.  That’s why astronomers are always looking for earth-like planets in the search for extraterrestrial life.

AerisMagia,1613162207.0,"I've noticed a lot of people suggesting that Pietro and Vision are just reflections of Wanda essentially, that it's not really them, but her perception of them. My thought is, what is keeping them from actually being... them? Wanda has the ability to alter reality, and I think that far extends past simply making someone seem alive. What I mean is, what IF they are TECHNICALLY alive, but only within the limits of Wanda's Hex. If Vision was just simply a projection of Wanda's perception of him, why would he have any desire to escape, and thus not fall apart instantly when he left the hex? Furthermore, if she was consistently suspending their minds, keeping them alive, why does it seem like she doesn't have complete control over them, even IF she is loosing control at times, I don't think they'd projected their own opinions, instead I think they'd cease to function in the moments we actually see them dead. I feel like this is further evident with how self-aware they both are. If you were to conjure someone by the rules within your mind, where would self-awareness come from if you didn't give them that, and what purpose would Wanda have to give either of them self-awareness if she's intended to maintain stability? I just think it wouldn't make sense. With the literal ability to alter the fabric of reality, I don't think anything stops Wanda from simply saying ""You are alive, but you are you."" I think it's the same Vision that loved her, I think it's the same Vision before he died. I think it's Vision himself, not what Wanda conjures within her mind. I mean hell, he has free will. The only other person to have that free will was Monica, who was essentially herself, real, alive. I don't know, that's just my opinion though."

KnackTwoBABYYY,1613162409.0,"Well, basically he's a huge nerd, he's very socially awkward and doesn't have much empathy, can be pretty self absorbed because of that and he has a lot of little rules he's crafted into his life such as always sitting on the exact same ""best"" spot on the couch, but he's also the most academically intelligent person on the show(he works as a physicist). Also it's worth noting it is suggested he is neuro divergent, specifically that he may have a form of aspergers

But I doubt your friends made as big of an assessment about him as that and maybe just call you that for being nerdy, maybe being awkward sometimes or doing some things that remind them of his gags in the show or because you're intelligent.

LoweLifeJames,1613162432.0,"I think that's looking too deep to be honest. If he was imitating Vision, he has to have knowledge of that happening with just the two of them in the room at that time. Assuming it's what they look like to everyone else and not just Wanda. So he would have to be playing some bigger force that was able to experience that scene without the cut.

That's assuming that that is what Vision looked like for everyone. I doubt his form actually changed for a split second. I think the most likely answer is that she's going crazy, or is simply just imagining her traumas such as both of their deaths, as it must be weird seeing them alive again."
Hellknightx,1613162442.0,"I'm not sold on the seal = hex theory. I'm still fully aboard the Mephisto train, so I think the seal is referencing the prison that he's trapped in, and if Wanda can't break the seal keeping Mephisto at bay, he will eventually kill her by ""snacking on Yo-magic.""

I think she made a bargain with him to bring Vision back to life, and in exchange he gets to feed off of her power until he's strong enough to break out of his prison and into our reality. He brought Vision back and created the Hex, using her power (probably short-term possession or mind control), and then made her forget about the bargain so she doesn't remember how it started or the circumstances of the bargain.

Final episode, he finally breaks out, the hex collapses, and Dr. Strange shows up, saying he knows a thing or two about bargains with evil entities, and then offers to train Wanda if she helps him with Mephisto."

In Hayward's case, though, he has a point.  He's certainly not being nice about things (and likely has secret plans involving Vision's body/tech), but everything he says makes sense if you stop seeing things from the audience perspective.  Obviously *we* know attacking Wanda isn't the answer because she's the main character, one of our heroes.  To Hayward she's a super-powered rogue who has consistently been at the epicenter of several disastrous events over the past decade.

Also, I find it a little weird that his description of his death is getting shot like a chump and dying for no reason at all, when Pietro's sacrifice was an active decision on his part to save Hawkeye and an innocent Sokovian kid.

swissarmychris,1613162695.0,"All right, I'm trying to piece together what we know about ""new"" Pietro to figure out where this could be going.

* He seems to have arrived from outside the Hex, since SWORD's breach alarms were going off when he arrived. So he's an outside influence of some kind, not just a townsperson or a creation of Wanda's.

* He has his super speed, which doesn't seem to be something the Hex would grant him -- it changes how people appear and act, but we haven't seen it change anyone's abilities. So the speed is probably his own power.

* He knows some general information about Pietro's life, but got slightly evasive when Wanda questioned him further. This could indicate that he's not the real Pietro and just knows about him from somewhere else, or it could be a red herring.

* He's fully aware of the Hex and is able to talk to Wanda about it, unlike everyone else in Westview -- even Vision.

* He's very interested in how the Hex got started. Wanda maintains that she doesn't know, which would mean that another person or entity is partially responsible, probably the villain. But the fact that Quicksilver is asking about it means that he *doesn't* know, so he's probably not affiliated with whoever set this up.

So we have a version of Quicksilver that looks like a different person but has his powers, who entered the Hex from the outside but is protected from its effects, and is interested in finding out how it all started.

Based on that, here's my theory: Dr. Strange, self-proclaimed protector of this reality, sees what Wanda is doing and wants to fix it. He knows she's too powerful to fight head-on, so he needs someone who can infiltrate the town and figure out what's going on. Someone who could get close to Wanda and gain her trust, without breaking the ""happy family"" thing she's got going. Someone like...her brother. So he plucks an alternate Quicksilver from another universe, fills him in, puts some protective spells on him, and sends him into Westview.

This explains why he looks different but has Quicksilver's powers, why he's able to resist Wanda's control, and why he has an interest in finding out how she's doing all this."

>Memories like growing up in Sokovia, remembering their parents, and dying after getting shot in the street?

One memory that Wanda disagrees with what happened and another memory that Pietro flat out avoids acknowledging. ""Remembering"" he was shot to death but not the circumstances surrounding it?

>or just the simulation giving her what she wants.

It didn’t tell Tony or Bruce how to create Vision, they just figured out how to connect the mind stone to tech. It’s debatable how much personal agency the stones have, I would personally liken them to forces of nature vs having any sort of consciousness we would understand. The mind stone was warning Vision of Thanos though, and there’s also some evidence that other stones are more than just stones. “The soul stone has a certain wisdom to it” - Red Skull. We should also remember they didn’t even know it was an infinity stone, or what an infinity stone really was. All we know so far is that Hydra wanted to use it to experiment on people, and used folks in Sokovia who had ‘generic oddities’. Experimenting on people to see what would happen is a very Nazi thing to do, and they were probably trying to make another type of super-soldier type being, like they were doing when they made Bucky.

WafflesDaddy1981,1613163192.0,"So, I strongly believe that Mephisto will not be in this show and that Quicksilver appearing has nothing to do with the Multiverse (and he is just a very meta recast of the MCU Quicksilver.   

Does anybody else have theories that dont involve either of these things? 

These are my  theories, not spoilers since nothing is confirmed but here is what I think will happen based on what has happened so far and based on casting rumors for other movies:

-Agnes will reveal to be Agatha (and she was a Salem witch, etc)and that she is either working for or partially controlled by Nightmare who manipulated all this to create the twins or because he needed Wandas full Scarlet Witch powers. 

-It will be revealed that Hayward is also bad but more like regular MCU bad and was trying to weaponize Visions body but couldnt, so they allowed Wanda to take it and basically do it for them. He will either be working for Hydra or Thunderbolt Ross which would tie into both Black Widow and Falcon, both of which should have been releases already.

-Monica will re-enter the Hex in her fancy tank and she wont lose her memory or become a sitcom character but going through the barrier again will give her the Spectrum powers.

-Wanda, Vision, Quicksilver, Monica etc. will have to join forces to fight Nightmare in the finale. The twins will age themselves again up to 15 or 16 to help in the fight.  Vision will get killed...Again, either directly by Nightmare or because Wanda needs to collapse the Hex to stop Nightmare. My guess is whoever is playingNightmare is the actor that Paul Bettany has been talking about. 

-Wanda will collapse the Hex but tear open a hole in the Multiverse and Nightmare will escape into it.  Wanda will get the twins (and maybe even Quicksilver) out safely and they will go on to be in Young Avengers. Evan Peters will officially be the revived MCU Quicksilver now that they have the rights to the full character.

-Wanda will join forces with America Chavez (one of her powers is to punch holes in the multi-verse and she is already confirmed) and Dr. Strange and possibly Quicksilver to go after Nightmare because she feels guilty about setting him loose on the multi-verse and that is the plot of MoM. They will jump to alternate realities chasing him, sort of like the TV show Sliders. These realities will include the Fox Xmen series, the Fox Fantastic Four series, and other realities including ones where the MCU actors are included the rumored one where Captain America is with Hydra.None od them will come into the MCU to stay except Deadpool.  If Mephisto is involved at all, it wouldnt be revealed until this movie."

Did the field originate from Wanda and expand in the same way, meaning that all of the townspeople crossed the barrier just like the SWORD members did? Or was the barrier something set up around the town after the fact?"

Then again, he could be both (if he was pulled into this universe at an earlier date and briefed by SWORD before going in). And if he is just a random schmo, it doesn't explain his powers. So, I guess I don't actually have any idea of what's going on."

Monica tried to talk to Wanda twice. Previous SWORD agents went into the town without weapons and were disappeared. Wanda deliberately kidnapped and brain raped an agent who, even after her escape, is weirdly sympathetic to her former captor in a way that seems suspicious.

i might add that everything you and i observe in it is a metaphor for man's history.

""A **preemptive war** is a **war** that is commenced in an attempt to repel or defeat a perceived imminent offensive or invasion, or to gain a strategic advantage in an impending (allegedly unavoidable) **war** shortly before that attack materializes.""

This is basically the history of humanity. ""Kill them first while we have the chance, or we may be killed later; maybe is too high a risk to bank our survival on that their good peaceful nature will prevail when they have a chance to attack us later, so let's kill them now in case they kill us later when they get a chance.""

The traits Helmut Zero and Heyward display are basically the traits of every ruler and conqueror in history, probably even modern history, but politicians can't show that reality of the decision making they have to do since they have to look nice and peaceful to the public in a lot of ways.

Heyward probably thinks of himself as incredibly patriotic. Making the hard, cold choices that need to be made to protect his country's citizens from superhuman threats."

Art_drunk,1613163749.0,"I think that’s a strong possibility, although Monica isn’t considered to be a mutant. My money is she gets her powers from passing back and forth through the barrier / repeated exposure to cosmic radiation + extra-dimensional energy (which is how she got powers in the comics).

If the hex does expand to cover the whole world, the cosmic radiation could cause people with the x-mutation to manifest their powers.

Obnoxious22,1613163777.0,"I dont think she let Vision fuck with her head at all.

They know next to nothing, and Hayward immediately jumps to Wanda being a supervillain, and immediately wants to kill her. 

Meanwhile Monica is looking for solutions to all the problems you're mentioning, trying to get through the barrier without getting brainwashed or transformed, and talk to Wanda. ""Oh I tired to reason with this criminal, but he blew me off, I guess I'll just give up"", that's not how hostages negotiations work, they would try again, breaking into the building and attacking is something they do when they absolutely have no other choice.

And my God, I didn't expect they would actually emulate Malcolm in the Middle. As soon as they did the Malcolm in the Middle-inspired opening credits, I was brought back to the days when I would watch the show reruns on the TV every day as a kid.

They nailed the format so well and I am glad most of the sitcom scenes were told from the POV of the kids. I also definitely enjoyed Paul Bethanny trying to emulate Bryan Cranston too!

And speaking of that intro, why didn't they show Agnes's last name? Everyone else is presented with their full names (they even use ""*The* Vision"" for Vision!). I'm guessing it's because Agnes either doesn't have a last name, or Agnes isn't her real name."

And if they did why did they eventually give it to SWORD? You would also think that over the 5 years after the Snap the Avengers would have caught wind his body was being experimented on and they would have gone and got it. They loved and respected Vision enough to try and find a way to remove the stone without killing him, so you’d think they wouldn’t just hand over his body after his death to a government agency. Also, I’m a little surprised that they haven’t called in Hawkeye or any of the Avengers haven’t heard about what’s going on with Wanda and headed to West View to try and talk to her. I’d really like to see the conversation the two of them would have in regards to what Wanda is doing, given how Clint had responded to his own grief by murdering a bunch of people."

Cyno01,1613165039.0,"Were certainly talking about it more.

Just like most everything else that was dropping seasons at once, look at the episode discussion threads over on r/Defenders, nothing like this. We watched it, we talked about it online for half an hour, and then tiptoed around it because we werent sure who IRL had seen it and didnt wanna spoil anything, but with week to week, after a few days you can be reasonably sure if someone cares theyve seen that weeks one episode because a <1hr commitment is a lot easier than a 13 hour one.  I mean im *here* 12 hours later, an E01 Netflix episode thread would be dead already compared to this because the hardcores would be way past it already and the casuals would be avoiding the thread. 

Even when it was bad, people were talking about Game of Thrones still because it was on every week. When it was just mediocre, everyone just forgot about Stranger Things. I just realized the meme has lost all association with the show for me but thats about all i can remember about the last season, it was at a mall. 

I mean some stuff i still wait for the season to be over to marathon it, like we dont GAF if arrowverse gets spoiled, were waiting till its all over and watching it all together at once. But now all the big Marvel and Star Wars and Star Trek stuff at least we watch week to week now. Which is nice because i get spoilers showing up on the front page of the stock news app on my iPhone within 12 hours... dick move by them, but now i dont have to worry about it one way or another.

But I also think the midnightish release time is technical more than anything, because an 8PM EST Thursday release time would be maximum buzz, but might crash their servers, which would be huge news for the show, but bad press for the streaming service itself."

therempel,1613165089.0,"I think her power is slowly growing. 

The first episode was only their home and Vision's office under her immediate control with only a handful of ""NPCs"", and Mrs Hart even managed to break control at one point.

The second added a more neighbors and general townsfolk. The third even more plot important NPCs (The Doctor), then the fifth is constrained back to a handful of characters because Vision starts openly questioning her, stealing focus and forcing her to concentrate on him.

Suddenly in episode six, we have a whole bunch of new families and children to interact with and then at the end of the episode, she grows the hex to take control of the SWORD agents. Her ability to control reality is either getting stronger or is being amped up by something else."

Darcey’s promo picture also has a chest shot of a a costume or suit. How the Hex affects her on a cellular level will be interesting too. Might be the slow burn push for mutants."

rageseraph,1613165159.0,"According to the wiki, the Blip takes place on the 17th of October (Don’t know their source off the top of my head), which is exactly two weeks before Halloween. If we say Hayward’s meeting with Monica in episode 4 is exactly 3 weeks post-blip, plus the ~24 hour day Monica spends in the Hex before SWORD sets up shop outside the barrier, we’re on November 8th. 9 days before that is the 30th, but I’m not sure if the briefing during episode 5 is right after Monica gets ejected, or a few hours to a day after, because she receives treatment and undergoes examination in the medical tent. If it’s “Monica enters”, add a day for “Sword sets up”, add a day for “Monica is treated, tested, debriefed, and the sword meets again to form a plan”, that would mean we’re on November 9th, and 9 days before would be directly on Halloween.

TobioOkuma1,1613165175.0,">You'd be restricting yourself to only hiring famous actors who are publicly out as gay.

Here is your mistake. You don't HAVE to have famous actors to be in these projects. There are plenty of non-mega famous people out there who could play these roles incredibly well. Marvel is more interested generally in finding people who fit the characters.

&#x200B;

Might I remind you that someone who is effectively a nobody will be playing Ms. Marvel on Disney Plus, Iman Vellani? The folks over at Marvel DO care a lot about staying true to the character. Ms. Marvel in the comics is Pakistani-American. They didn't need someone of that descent to play the character, they could have whitewashed it if they wanted to, but they didn't.

&#x200B;

Hell, even among famous people there are lesser knowns that would be great. I'll remind you that Tom Holland wasn't some huge name before he became one of the most beloved Peter parkers. There are plenty of gay actors out there that would KILL as Billy.

&#x200B;

poindexterg,1613165197.0,"I think you’re correct about most of it. 

I dont think a new bad guy will show up here, outside of maybe an appearance at the end setting up for future stuff. 

Pietro isn’t from the X-men films, he’s stunt casting. This isn’t bringing in mutants. This is, however, how Monica gets her powers. 

Hayward is definitely just your stock Military bad guy. Nothing else going on there. 

Wanda will be the main villain at the end. I think there could be someone else involved (Agnes could still be something), but they won’t be a major villain. 

I think it’s quite possible that the person Monica contacted is Reed Richards. It would be a good way to set him up prior to Fantastic 4. If it’s not him, then it’s some already established MCU character."

Even villains who only shows up at the end like Dormammu was referenced directly in the book, has his followers summoning him, and foreshadowed when Strange is jumping through multiverse early in the movie. Character who revealed to be villain like Pierce, Ego, Mysterio was shown early. I honestly can't remember when a marvel villain not show in the first ⅓ of a movie. The movie sometimes opened with villain scenes. And by shows up, I don't mean in random animal forms. In Mcu, the villains is almost as important as the hero and it's important for viewers to understand the villain.

InvaderDJ,1613165639.0,"This episode feels like they simplified the plot dramatically. 

Now the smart money feels like it is “It’s all Wanda”. She seemed to admit in this episode that she brought Pietro to this world and that she is in control of everyone, just not all at one time. That’s why Pietro came in at such a convenient time for her, that’s why there were no kids shown in the previous episodes, and that’s why people are glitching. Well, I think the glitching is also coming from her being intentionally less and less subtle as time goes on. She’s showing off her powers more and is less afraid of them. 

Hayward also now just seems to be a traumatized survivor of the Snap. He was thrust into power when half of all life disappeared and the chaos and tragedy made him basically hate everyone with powers. He doesn’t seem to be some secret mastermind. The Vision dissection is suspicious as was Darcy’s line about trying to find Hayward’s secrets but it feels like that is just angling toward him using Vision’s corpse to make weapons to defend the earth or something. 

We’re in the home stretch now so we’ll see if this holds up. But it makes me doubt that we’ll get any type of supernatural big bad."

Then for this episode like malcolm in the middle had a bigger focus on more kids.

Also it seems like the hex is updating for shows as vision becomes more aware of the situation he is in. like every show it does adds an element that was missing. the color helicopter came in so then it turned color on the show. I seems like the environment is changing to fit whats going on.

Etheros64,1613165936.0,"As powerful as Doctor Strange is, I don't think he'd waste time antagonizing Wanda or make himself look like a different Pietro. I think he plucked Peter out of his universe and sent him into the hex with the mission to figure out what was going on.

That's why Peter is antagonizing her(he is acting like Fox Quicksilver would) and being very inquisitive as to how she was able to do this(on his mission for Doctor Strange). Doctor Strange probably gave him some generic background details on what he should know as Pietro, but when Wanda asks personal questions(one's than only the real Pietro should know) he avoids answering it by changing the subject or antagonizing her."

Woo and Monica taking out those guards, Darcy all of a sudden is a hacking genius, Monica ignoring the dangers of what is happening to her body...it was just all very unrealistic and like you said, reminds me of a kids movie how the ragtag group of heroes come together conveniently pull something out their arse. 

If Hayward wasn’t a bad guy with ulterior motives, then I believe he’s doing what any government would do. A bit rash yes, but that ‘let’s defeat her with words and compassion’ bullshit is unreasonable."
SupremeMamba,1613166145.0,Simplest answer is usually the most likely answer. It might be already too late to introduce that big of a villain this late into the show so at most it'll be someone like Agnes/Dottie/Pietro/Hayward being a big bad in disguise.

Ultron didn't need the mind stone because he was just an AI, like Jarvis was. Vision was created when the stone was combined Jarvis to make something new. Something more alive.

> Someone who can create/summon people should be able to fix Vision imo. At least his physical form even if his personality isn’t quite there.

Wanda *did* fix his physical form. We've been watching it walk around for the last six episodes.

I'm not arguing with you, I'm agreeing with your original point: Wanda hasn't been able to fully bring Vision back to life. She can put his physical form back together, but without the mind stone, he's not complete -- he's being sustained by her powers, which is why he wasn't able to fully leave the Hex."

I watch WV with my wife that's not familiar with the comicbooks and it's silly to think that the actual devils should shows up because characters joked about devils. It's like characters snapping the fingers, a lot of grapes in the table, characters moving stones with gloves, characters joked about alien, and actually expecting Thanos snapping the infinity gauntlet at the end.


I might be totally wrong, it just my thought. Won't even mad if Mephisto actually shows up as the final villain, it just wouldn't be as satisfying, imo. Still have 3 more eps for Mephisto buildup if they really want to though."

Stommped,1613166932.0,"You make good points, but I don't think for example that the Doctor knows anything is wrong just because he made that comment.  If they were all fully aware that they are trapped then you wouldn't need to have Vision do what he did to Norm to ""release"" him.  The Doctor, Norm, the postman, etc. seem to be trapped inside their bodies and on the outside act as if nothing is wrong, whereas Dottie, Herb seem to be aware that Wanda is controlling this town and they need to play along.

Which is why I come back to Agnes, who is such a unique character.  She seemed to be in that Dottie/Herb category where she was just playing along for Wanda, not even caring about her and the twins' powers, yet in the most recent episode she seems to be one of the trapped characters, and Vision has to ""release"" her.  Extremely strange. In terms of screentime, she's by far the most important Westview resident, yet Jimmy and SWORD were unable to identify her, I think that's huge.  She said all those bad things about Monica to Vision, but then wouldn't let Herb finish his sentence, seemingly having control over him. Finally the Ralph thing, she's brought him up so many times there's no way it's just a sitcom bit at this point.  Where is he?"
daddyhart,1613166947.0,Ooops... I just noticed a continuity problem.

incognito_nita,1613167071.0,I 100% believe Herb is self aware and has some sort of important role in everything going on like almost Agnes level.

This is pretty much a continuation:

Yo-Magic represents the Soul Gem.

In order to get what you wish for you have to sacrifice yourself. The child then faded away into a reddish skull just like The Stonekeeper 


I think Wanda is using the remnants of the Soul Gem power that she absorbed and that’s how she has created Vision and Pietro. She unwittingly brought them back but versions from another universe. That’s why this Pietro looks like the Fox version but had the same fate as the MCU version. In another timeline that’s how it was. Same thing with Vision, this is why he has no knowledge of the Avengers. This is a Vision that was created on a world without Avengers"

This show opens itself up to widely divergent speculation. My theory? The town had come under control of mephisto... Possibly summoned by Agnes. Now mephisto is using Wanda to preserve/expand the ""farm"" by giving Wanda incentive to play along.

I think it's probably going to be an incredibly complicated  plot involving Loki, Dr strange, Wanda, Kang the conquerer,ect... I kind of hope that if they continue captain America in the mcu, outside of cameos and such, it would be through returning the stones and mjolnir, but it doesn't go exactly as planned...

PhuckSJWs,1613167562.0,"to be specific, yes a stone was on his forehead. we have no idea if it is a real stone or one created by Wanda for appearances sake. We did not see it exhibit any powers.

EverydayQuestions-,1613167576.0,"I definitely get this feeling after the latest episode, but it’s also kind of disappointing? After the Spider-Man FFH “twist,” now would be the time to introduce a true multiverse. Going with Evan Peters’ Quicksilver and then having an aspect of “jk no multiverse yet, *again*” would be kind of annoying imo. 

If they minimize Evan Peters, not making him “truly” be Quicksilver and pulling the multiverse rug out from under us again when it’s obviously coming in the next Dr. Strange movie... idk if I’d like that decision. 

I also hope there’s more at play than just Mephisto, a brand new character pulled out of the hat in the final couple episodes that I (and probably most people) aren’t particularly invested in. I hope there’s a mix of OP Wanda, Mephisto, *actual* Quicksilver who has a role beyond this series, an introduction of mutants, and maybe some Dr. Strange action."

SolidusSnoke,1613167630.0,"So I'm going to throw this out there - apologies if somebody else has already posted this. The theatre is playing two films in this episode, The Incredibles (2004) and The Parent Trap (1998 I assume). That's not accidental.

In The Incredibles the villain's famous quote is ""when everyone is super, noone is."" Given that the hex can rewrite your DNA, this seems like a sneaky reference to a potential Wanda-based expansion of powers in the world. The obvious suggestion is the X-Men as many have already suggested. In the film superheroes are also given secret identities and live suburban lives - precisely what Wanda has been trying to do in Westview.

The Parent Trap has a pair of twins trying to reunite their parents, who have separated. Thematically this fits with what's happening here - Billy and Tommy are reuniting Wanda and Vision, their 'parents', though whether they're real and their motive for doing so remains unclear. The 'trap' bit here might be key to the future plot."

She acts much differently than the other frozen people, and her car just sitting on the edge of town is suspicious as hell. My theory is that she was putting on a victim act specifically to make Vision ""save"" everyone in town by going through the barrier. It's possible that she is trying to push Wanda to her limits by forcing her to expand the hex to save Vision. Maybe I'm totally wrong, and she's just a red herring, but imo that whole scene was far too suspicious to be dismissed as nothing."

FoxyTheBoyWithNoName,1613167802.0,"Eh I mean when Wanda and Thanos destroyed and removed the stone respectively in both cases they also destroyed his body so it’s not exactly the best comparison. 

I think you’re forgetting Ultron is directly derived from the mind stone also. He isn’t just like Jarvis, Tony couldn’t figure out how to make that level of AI he had to use the Mind stone. Ultron wanted to use the Visions Android body for himself too, he wasn’t reliant on the Stone?  In infinity war they theorised it wouldn’t destroy him. Am dealing with a lot of theoreticals but I do think he’s an android, I don’t consider him alive even with the use of the stone. Stone just allowed the extremely advanced AI. 

Did she fix his physical form? I kinda imagined him leaving the Hex and him flopping down to his black and white broken state him disintegrating was pretty ambiguous. But yeah honestly I think maybe you’re right researching it the physical parts are there they’re just getting “sucked” back into the Hex maybe."

Pietro showing up and seeming to really continually push Wanda for info.

That was the first time we saw anything pass through the barrier after Wanda strengthened it (if I remember correctly), save for Wanda herself. And they made a very, very specific point to show Monica's clothes staying in tact, and Monica even exclaimed what is inside *is* real.

rambeau has no believable emotional conflict to be THIS insistent of giving wanda a chance and being so forgiving to want to give her a chance after what wanda has done. the reasoning for her insistence on this so far has been, ""i talked with her for two minutes, she didn't kill me, therefore i know there must be some good in her!""

think of a legendary movie that has a similar dynamic. star wars return of the jedi. luke skywalker probably feels some pressure to just kill darth vader after all the terrible things he's done to help the universe. but he wants to give him a chance to be good again; and he is insistent that there is still good in him and can ""feel"" the good. ""there's still good in you. thats why you didn't kill me when you had the chance (luke said that darth vader)"". padme, when dying, told obi wan there is still good in anakin. BOTH OF THESE PEOPLE BEING FORGIVING ENOUGH OF ALL THE BAD IN DARTH VADER TO WANT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO BE REDEEMED ARE BELIEVABLE BECAUSE THE EMOTIONAL CONNECTION/CONFLICTS THAT COMPELS THIS COMPASSION TO VADER IS BELIEVABLE. father son. husband wife.

wanda wanting to hold back as long as possible before killing vision so thanos doesn't get the infinity stone, and you can sense the push pull between her personal desire of not wanting to kill her loved one, and doing what's right for her persona life, is believable emotion and good multi dimensionalness to a character.

multi dimensionalness that this ragtag team lacks because there's been no indication of them having what wanda had in the moment with vision, a desire to not kill, but kill for a greater good if needed.

none of them have any emotional reason to be this emotionally invested in the degree of zealous compassion they are showing to wanda. thus, a stupid ragtag trope.

Edit: Another ""convenience"". What? I think it was one guard watching over the whole compound's top secret digital network, where you can use your personal laptop's usb port to plug into the whole network that has encryption that takes 5 seconds and a few key strokes to get into?

Edit 2: And good point about Rambeau. She's going to go in to save Wanda, someone she has no reason to care that much about, she's going to go flying into the Hex to save even after being informed that going into the hex has changed her whole body's biology?

bminicoast,1613168055.0,"> Because why would they specifically cast Evan Peters to play those roles? A nod to the fans? No, too cheap. A clever cameo? No, it wouldn't be clever, it would be scummy.

I agree with your feelings about it, but especially like your critical thinking.  Too often when we watch movies or TV, we don't put a lot of thought into clothing, backgrounds, etc, because...there has to be *something* there.  They have to put some stuff up on the walls of a house or it would look weird.  You can't have actors naked, so of course they have to put on clothes.

But all of those things are *choices* that the people making the movie make.  There's often a *reason* why they specifically chose those clothes, or that decor, or whatever.  Getting this dude to play someone pretending to be Quicksilver but not actually Quicksilver is ridiculous- they *just happened* to pick the only other person to play this character on the big screen **ever**?

No.

SandpiperAir,1613168247.0,I think Pietro is the Pietro from Fox's X-Men universe brought here by Doctor Strange to try and be able to talk to Wanda. He couldn't resurrect her dead brother but he could find the next best thing somewhere in the multiverse. He may have coached him up the best he could but it's clear he doesn't know everything.

rafaelloaa,1613168340.0,"I mean I agree with you thematically, but (assuming it's accurate), we're shown that Strucker was experimenting on her & Pietro using Loki's Scepter, which in turn had the Mind Stone in it. I mean it's always possible that those scenes in AoU and forward were intentionally fake/misleading, but I doubt it. Also at the point in time when Wanda got her powers, the Aether was in the weird cosmic vault where Jane Foster eventually found it.

From my recollection, only the stones themselves give off the color representative of them, not entities who have obtained powers from said stones. Like Captain Marvel's powers are mostly yellowish, even though she got her powers from the Space Stone (blue), while Ronin's Hammer, the Eye of Agamotto, and Vision himself are purple, green and yellow, respectively."

In the real world we had the closest equivalents to Tony Stark (super-smart rich guys with all sorts of crazy futuristic businesses) ordering their staff back to work during a pandemic because that would make them a bit more money than helping to deal with it.

In the last couple of episodes of WandaVision, they've spoken about Maria Rambeau dying of cancer. It turns out Tony Stark can do about as much to help the fake world with cancer as smart people in the real world can do to help with Covid-19..."
LoudMouthHoe,1613168466.0,Also Vision calls her Agness when he supposedly breaks her out of Wandas hex. But in a prior episode we see that everyone is given a different name in the Hex. You’d think she would’ve corrected Vision with her real name or ask who Agness is.

And she's freaks out when it's not there. Maybe she was running away because of the presence of someone else, maybe ""Pietro"" and thought he killed her when he took the pendant. I do believe she's been aware most of the time but Wanda's magic does affect her, and I don't think she is the one behind it all, maybe helped the person who is manipulating Wanda and she now regrets being involve."

My other point still stands though, I'd be much more likely to agree with you if you had said ""gay actor"". In that aspect, sure, I'd prefer if a gay character like Wiccan was played by a gay actor. I don't think he **needs** to be played by a gay actor, but I'd personally like it."

Furthermore, he doesn't even speak like her brother at all… if they intended this to be the same MCU Quicksilver, you'd think he'd have thrown in at LEAST one ""didn't see that coming"".

InvaderDJ,1613169278.0,"I think the control thing is explained by saying that she doesn’t want to control loved ones. She wants a happy life with Vision, she wants her brother when Vision starts to distance himself from her. She doesn’t want automatons that’s she’s puppeting around. Her sinister “can’t I?” when Vision said she can’t control him makes me think she’s perfectly capable of it. I think she has similar feelings about bringing random people or things back from the dead. I think that’s why she didn’t just reanimate Sparky. She probably can even if she doesn’t consciously realize it. But she wants a normal, happy life. And part of that is having people who can disagree with you and having to deal with the death of pets.

bellowingbullfinches,1613169339.0,"That’s a false dichotomy. As Monica points out in the show and as we see proven correct, “taking the shot” was idiotic. Best case it would kill Wanda and her kids and the Hex would end. Worst case it would cause the Hex to explode, unravel reality, and destroy the universe. The Director literally has *no idea* where on that spectrum the drone strike would fall.

Of course, the god-tier witch who has complete control over an entire town wasn’t bothered by the drone strike, so it ended up doing nothing except raising tensions. 

As I said in another comment, the show is heavily implying that the Director stole Vision’s body to research. The Director was probably close to finishing his weapons when Wanda stole the body back. Now the Director wants to kill Wanda as that’s the only way he’ll get the body back. That’s pretty much the only way that him attacking Wanda makes sense for the reasons pointed out above.

In other words, he’s probably evil, and back to my original point, Monica hitting him with a harmless energy blast would be really satisfying. I don’t know why that upsets anyone."

2. He is the only person other than Wanda who knows what’s happening and everything that has happened beforehand. 

3. When he dresses as quicksilver in episode 6, his hair has two points on the sides, similar to the horns of the devil 

4. He said he is “impressed”, by what Wanda has done to the innocent people trapped in west view 

5. When he mentions him and Wanda trick or treating as kids, Wanda says, “that’s not how I remember it” 

6. When one of the twins starts speeding around with his newfound powers, pietro says, “raise hell demonspawn”.

ThackCankle,1613169608.0,"That usually seems to be the case with the MCU.. the theories are always fun but generally what actually happens is way less complex than what most people theorize (captain marvel's arrival to the Endgame plot as well as Endgame in general being two good recent examples).

Also the MCU operates in a way that everything is more or less a set-up for a future project. We will definitely see at least one more big set-up at the end of the show but I anticipate it being a tease of the fallout of the hex rather than a reveal of a major overarching villian. I think it won't be until Dr Strange 2 that we actually see some sort of villainous resolution start to occur in regards to the multiverse."

Honestly, I don't understand why so many people want WandaVision to result in some sort of reverse House of M, with Wanda inadvertedly creating mutants. Heck, I don't understand why so many people want WandaVision to set up pretty much the entirety of upcoming MCU content (seriously, I've even seen theories suggesting that we'd see people like Hammer show up). Anyway, going back to mutants, them being a creation of Wanda kinda removes an important aspect of their backstory, that they're, well, a next step in evolution, and that's what drives the anti-mutant sentiment."

Norm, the Harts, Phil, Dottie (?), Geraldine (until snapping out at the mention of Pietro), all the new Halloween cast.

- **Facilitators.** One level up from above. Handful of townies. Still hexed, but have a limited special awareness about Wanda, the hex, and the inability to leave. Unfazed by displays of super powers (card trick, super speed, kids aging up). Seem to have decided that appeasing Wanda and helping maintain the status quo is better than the alternative. “Should we take it from the top?” “Small towns, so hard to leave.” “Is there anything I can do? Anything you want changed?” E.g. Agnes, Herb, Dr. Nielsen, mailman (?).

- **Wild cards.** Pietro and the twins are in a class of their own. Pietro’s “vessel” is probably still someone sourced from the general population. The twins probably a combination of Wanda’s powers + unknown forces. Has powers, with twins immune to Wanda. Pietro has imperfect knowledge of their childhood together; deep knowledge of Westview’s enslavement, sitcom tropes, and major events after his death; and curiosity about how Wanda made it all happen. Pietro acts like a mole, out to pry secrets from Wanda. Can’t help himself about saying inconsiderate things, even at the cost of losing Wanda’s trust.

- **Vision.** “Resurrected” from combination of his remains, Wanda’s powers, and unknown force (?). Moral code and sense of reason intact. Zero memory of life before Westview. Originally content by life with Wanda, which is breaking down. Is able (as a fellow child of the Mind Stone?) to snap hexed people out of the trance. Cannot exist in resurrected form outside of the anomaly.

TheAdvisor99,1613170258.0,"What deal did Wanda make with the devil when she was most vulnerable?

&#x200B;

If we believe that Mephisto is involved we should assume he offered her a deal.  What would Wanda want - a happy life with Vision and kids - so lets assume that was what he offered.  With his help they can have the happy life she always wanted. 

&#x200B;

What was the cost for this deal?  Most likely that she needed to create the hex which Mephisto knows is a portal to the multiverse.  With a portal to the multiverse he knows that Wanda (or himself) would be able to summon a version of Vision to this reality.  

&#x200B;

For all we know Mephisto approaches Wanda after she breaks into the lab and finds out Vision dissembled in some way that's not reversible.  Maybe the directors life work was to destroy it and that's why he knows Visions will.  Seeing him back alive could be his motivation.  Who knows yet.  

&#x200B;

I am figuring for the happy life the devil asked to look at her memories to find her happiest moments which turn out to be tv shows.  

&#x200B;

They possibly bring back a multiverse version that didn't get activated with Thors hammer?

&#x200B;

Now that a version of the Vision is back Mephisto has been feeding off the mind stone (latest commercial). This is allowing him to possess the entire town in the hex but while looking like Wanda is in control.  Devil is living up to his end of the deal by giving her the happy life using the townspeople to do it. 

&#x200B;

I believe at devil is behind the scenes more than we know and has probably been able to possess everyone in the town at some point or another (except Vision and maybe Pietro).   He was probably limited in his powers but now that vision is in the hex and the mind stone from another universe is here - he is able to control most of the town and possibly Wanda at times.  I think this may be evident in the early episodes he tried to make Wanda do things but wasnt powerful enough yet (dinner seen with the boss choking but can now when Monica mentioned Pietro.  

&#x200B;

As far as possession there seem to be clues with the dread and sadness from the townspeople which is what Mephisto would do.  If he has to take over Wanda then it takes a lot more power and the others break free - thinking about Agnes and Herb when Monica is ejected - and maybe Agnes has been tortured by the devil and was warning Herb not to break character when not possessed. 

&#x200B;

Lets look at Herb for a minute.  First cutting thru the wall trying to get attention when Wanda was distracted but didnt say anything bad.  Mephisto may have promoted him to a right hand man as he asked about wanting something changed.  He would let Mephisto know to use Wandas powers to change something.  Someone else has the ability to change reality.

&#x200B;

Not sure how Pietro got there or why but someone else mentioned this could be Dr. Strange trying to calm the situation down.  I kinda like this idea because Strange wouldnt know Pietro and could have pulled the wrong one from the multiverse.  

&#x200B;

I also like the idea that the cut scenes are edited by Mephisto as well and that we will probably get an episode of just that. 

&#x200B;

Darcy as the bearded woman - thats my guess."

caliguy420,1613170271.0,"I just thought of it. Director Hayward said all agents have all been called back from space in episode 4. Monica's contact is Nick Fury. He's back on earth I'm assuming or it will be Talos Fury. Yes, Reed would have access to the type of armored vehicle she would need, but it's too early to introduce him to the MCU. And Dr. Strange may make an appearance in the last episode to lead into MOM but I don't think he has access to armored vehicles. Let's stop the speculation about Mephisto. It's pretty obvious he's the greater big bad manipulating the strings or manipulating Wanda's powers and he's prob the one who veiled himself as Wanda and stole Vision's body and is acting like a puppet master in Pietro's body. IDK how they're going to explain Evan Peter's Quicksilver cross over, but I do not think the hex or Westview will be mutant related.

Agnes, on the other hand, dropped Wanda's name. i think she is the one behind all of this and is putting the blame on Wanda. i think Agnes is weak compared to Wanda and is using Wanda to get what she wants."

oddinyourfavours20,1613170599.0,"Hi! I’m new here and wanted to share my thoughts on this episode. 
Anyone else confused by the fact that Vision had to ‘wake’ Agnes up? I thought she was awake already because of that scene with Herb and the freaky “Shoud I do it again” scene.. 
My thoughts on this is that she acted like what Vision was doing to her worked, the ‘waking’ up part. Just to tell Vision extra information/dirt so he can be curious about this even more. Or maybe a more evil reason is that she knew that if Vision would go ‘outside’ it will kill him. I think if Agnes didn’t acted ‘woke’ Vision would suspect her and wonder why his powers didn’t work on her. Her motive behind her is to sabotage Wanda because Agnes is stuck in her world too. And somebody on twitter suspected that she was there to wait for Monica."

Shes lost control of Vision(if she even truly had it in the first place) and Pietro somehow knows Wanda is in control of this all additionally I dont believe she's able to control Tommy and Billy. However she seems in control of everyone else aside from the occasional slip up. In the previous episode when Pietro knocked on the door Wanda swore she didnt do it and looked completely shocked when she saw who it was. 

What I'm wondering is if she made a deal with Mephisto to revive Vision and so she would stay in her own bubble so he can forward his own scheme. Once he saw Wanda was losing control he decided to ""bring back"" Pietro, or rather steal and alternative version of him from a sister universe to the MCU so that Wanda will stay distracted. We already know Marvel's bringing the multiverse to us with Doctor Strange so Im wondering if this is Pietro from the X-men Universe and if we will see some of the other characters return Multiverse of Madness"
IniNew,1613170878.0,"A lot of those could def be references to Mephisto.

The hair thing though was Quicksilver's classic [costume](https://www.classicmarvelforever.com/cms/assets/images/profiles/comic_book/Quicksilver.png).

The ""demonspawn"" comment was absolutely a reference to the [classic story line](https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mephisto_\(Earth-616\)#:~:text=Mephisto's%20soul%20was%20used%20by,order%20to%20ease%20her%20pain.) of Wanda using Memphisto's soul to create her two children. It's also the story where Agnes comes from.

I originally thought he was going to be Memphisto as well, but I'm not so sure anymore. Agnes and Herb have both shown awareness, but also concern if Wanda doesn't get what she wants. There is also the woman ""stuck"" in the loop of hanging the ghost decoration who has a tear run down her face. And when Vision wakes Agnes up, Agnes has full awareness of what's happening to them all. I honestly think Pietro is just ""free"" from Wanda's control because Wanda doesn't want to control him. He's aware because Wanda just wants her brother, not a weird sitcom version of him."

we know that Wanda is letting people partially be themselves while controlling everyone because of one line in the middle of the episode. Vision and Pietro (i know he was recast but she would be trying to get her brothers personality, not this dude’s) are both dead, so i think Wanda is emulating their personalities herself partly (more than the others). i think her “emulation” of them is partly from memories, but also partly from her sub-conscience, with part of her mind that knows what she is doing is wrong, and the part that wants it to happen through Pietro.

KenBoCole,1613171246.0,">As Monica points out in the show and as we see proven correct, “taking the shot” was idiotic.

Her Brother was killed by bullets, and wanda before has been hurt by less, it wasn't far fetched to think a missile could kill her, but this wanda is much stronger and faster. 

>Worst case it would cause the Hex to explode, unravel reality, and destroy the universe.

Wanda dose not have enough power to animate all the npc's in her world, she has to leave the ones near the outskirts in a stasis state. I doubt that she could destroy the world, or universe.

>As I said in another comment, the show is heavily implying that the Director stole Vision’s body to research. 

Where does it imply he stole the body at all? It was said that Vision's living will was not to be revived, and in an era where half the hero's were dusted, Iron Man peaced out to a log cabin, he was probably given Vision's body to study. Him not reviving vision was showing respect. 

>The Director was probably close to finishing his weapons when Wanda stole the body back.

And? If he was developing weapons, how does that make him any worse than Tony Stark? You say that as if making weapons for the government to use against creatures like thanos is evil.

>Now the Director wants to kill Wanda as that’s the only way he’ll get the body back.

If the director only wanted visions body, he would not have just stood their with a cautious look as he saw Vision being ripped apart piece by piece. He would have been like darcy ordering his men to help him.

>That’s pretty much the only way that him attacking Wanda makes sense for the reasons pointed out above.

Or that he is trying to save an entire town's population the only way he knows how.

>Monica hitting him with a harmless energy blast would be really satisfying

It would be an abuse of power, and a dick move. The directors actions were not unwarranted."

> Honestly, I don't understand why so many people want WandaVision to result in some sort of reverse House of M, with Wanda inadvertedly creating mutants. 

Well, we've been waiting for an inclusion of X-Men since they bought the rights from Fox. I find it understandable people are tentatively awaiting how they would include them, do you not? They can hardly have Cyclops or Storm show up with the ""we've been here all along"" card.

So instead of a being Holocaust survivor perhaps Magneto survived some other atrocity in the late 20th century, (sadly there’s no lack of options there), instead of being a long time mutant rights activist perhaps Charles is a long time civil rights activist who now has to step up to defend mutant rights.

Hour_Disastrous,1613173011.0,"Random fun fact: if the ""Sentient Weapons"" referred to in SWORD are robots and AIs like Vision and Ultron, you also have A.I.D.A. from Agents of Shield, the AI who started out as a robot/LMD, was uploaded into The Framework fake reality where she was Madame Hydra, then transferred her consciousness into a living host body back into the real world, which sounds a lot like Vision's arc in WandaVision (transported into Westview, now trying to escape back into the real world).

A.I.D.A.'s physical appearance was based upon a character in Agents of Shield named Agnes.  Who was married to someone named Radcliffe.  Which is kind of an uninteresting fact on its own, but Radcliffe's final fate was to be deleted from the Framework, but if you assume his deletion was somehow ""incomplete"" and he survived, an allegorical incomplete deletion of certain letters from Radcliffe's name does leave you with ""Ralffe""

I also don't think that the corpse shot was real either. Vision made sense because he's a robot that she stole the body of. Unless SHIELD or SWORD kept Pietro's body on ice for eight years, there's no way you'd be able to reanimate it with a few bullet holes. It might be an alternate universe Pietro, it might be a trick pulled by someone else, but I'm certain that it's not MCU Pietro Maximoff reanimated."

She wouldve grown up then, so its unlikely fresh shows from that time would have shown up on a poor Sokovians tv.

Meanwhile, if we get 2010s next episode, that just makes sense since her move to the states as part of the Avengers.

Haden56,1613173481.0,"Completely agree. I think it's less of a proximity thing and more of a relevance thing. Agnes is the nosy neighbor who interacts with the family a lot so she's constantly acting and doing things. We don't see her do anything more unusual than any other character hasn't already done. She's probably terrified of having to be around Wanda so much, who everyone knows is in charge, and wants so much to leave but literally can't."

Recast? Imposter? Alternate version? Could be any of them at this point. I don't think the flash of ""dead Pietro"" is meant to be literal, it's just Wanda remembering the pain from her past that she's trying to avoid."
Giorggio360,1613173578.0,"I think another Avenger is already trapped inside - specifically, I think it might be Dr Strange.

The MCU does decent lip service to why other heroes haven't turned up. In Winter Soldier, Fury mentions Iron Man helped with the helicarriers and he's not around. War Machine says he was in Hong Kong during the first Avengers movie. The first thing they'd say in the writing room is ""Why isn't another Avenger getting involved?"".

SWORD seems very quick to scramble people to this situation. Jimmy Woo, expert on the Sokovia Accords and Ant-Man's minder post Civil War has apparently now been relegated to missing people's ops in New Jersey. SWORD get expert scientists and their crack team their in a day after they realise what's going on. In a post-snap world, they're only doing that if something's going on.

I thought it might be the kid (which I now think is Wiccan) but I think Dr Strange is trapped somewhere in Westview and he's going to turn up soon. If Mephisto is the villain of this and Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness, then having Dr Strange understand what kind of threat he is will be necessary for that film.

I think having him as a member of the community that inadvertently got trapped makes more sense to me. I can't believe that an MCU show would go this long without at least a throwaway line of ""Shouldn't we call the Avengers?"" by now."

HedonistDusk,1613173819.0,"This is all leading to the multiverse, so in my mind, it would actually make sense if he were pulled from another reality/dimension/timeline, aka the Fox one. I'm not guaranteeing it, but there are logical issues with him being a revived MCU Pietro instead, like how does he know anything about after he died? He knew that Vision died. He clearly knows a lot more than MCU Pietro did or would, being dead all this time. Seems like Vision's memory was wiped entirely, knowing nothing about pre-Westview, so how does a revived MCU Pietro know so much if that's really him?

Either way, I see this Pietro as a mole who's probably infiltrated on a mission to figure out what's going on in the hex. He's playing along as her ""brother"", whether or not he's the Fox Pietro, trying to get info. Side note: if he's Mephisto, I see no reason for him to ask Wanda about how she set everything up if HE was the one to set it up. That would simply serve as exposition for the audience, which is kinda bad writing and not quite what the MCU would do.

Also, even we don't know if she really is the kidnapper, or if there's something else going on. And even if she was, which is horrible, doesn't mean you should shoot her with a fucking missile. This is the kinda shit that gets innocent people killed in real life, the justice system is there to protect people, not to punish people. The whole reason we send people to prison and not kill them is because we believe every person deserves a chance at redemption. But the American justice system doesn't offer that chance, it just threats criminals like shit, and then spits them out forever branded as criminals, so they usually have no choice but to go back to crime, because they have no way of functioning in the regular society."

Those are mutates.

It's basically in every way changing what mutants actually are. It's supposed to be naturally occurring. If they're introduced, the multiverse makes more sense. Or Wanda rewrites reality worldwide so mutants start occurring naturally. Or some people already have the X gene but it doesn't activate naturally, Wanda does something that leads to it starting to activate. But unnaturally making everyone in one town into ""mutants"" doesn't really fit with what mutants are in Marvel."

Pietro being Mephisto or something like that just doesn't seem plausible at this stage in the story. Like, there hasn't been even a single clear indication in the last 6 episodes, not even in the dialogue. 

I'll be surprised if I'm eating my words, but writing on projects like this is usually _really tight_. So for there not to be any dialogue that could hint at this in 6/9 episodes? That would be a lot to pack in to the final 90 minutes.

Purely by feats alone he’s taken down Dormammu, comfortably went 1 v 1 with multi-infinity gem Thanos and opened dozens of portals across the universe simultaneously.

It’s the main reason why they made him have to stop a flood during the final fight in Endgame, his power set is stupidly versatile so if you don’t remove him from the equation it opens up a lot of potential plot holes, it’s also the reason they had to remove the time stone from him as it just completely breaks power scaling."

Elemayowe,1613175392.0,"Hmm. No happy ending where Vision is resurrected, I mean I knew from the start but had some hope. If he can’t leave “the Hex” he’s screwed. 

The point we’re at I’m less concerned with how the series ends and more with the implications for the MCU. Monica as Photon is seemingly the biggest one right now. What Wanda going off the deep end means could get real interesting depending on if there’s someone causing it and who that is (tying into DS2 presumably). Are the kids real? And does that point towards Young Avengers like many other cues (Cassie Lang, Ironheart series, Kamala Khan etc)? Darcy and Woo could branch out but it’ll just end up an AoS knock off I’m not sold on that tbh.

Getting real weird with Evan Peters you raise the question of potential multiverse/mutant stuff. Any multiverse shenanigans leads to a universe of possibilities. And Monica’s aerospace engineer friend, are they off potential importance? 

This show feels less like an important story in its own right and more like a catalyst for phase 4, this could branch into so much and I’m excited to see the ground work it lays more than I am the actual story itself."
NotACaveiraMain,1613175431.0,Hopefully Vision has somewhat of a good ending at the end of the show. He deserves better (same for Wanda).
Luxury-ghost,1613175433.0,"I think it's confirmed, but if not explicitly confirmed, then at least it's probable, that Captain Marvel can use those hex-gate things that they use in GOTG2 to travel across space at a tremendous rate. So she can get to Earth from wherever she happens to be, at short notice. So the time delay problem isn't at Danvers' end.

Nick Fury has a tiny transmitter based on 30 year old tech. When Fury makes the transmission, who knows how long it takes for that signal to reach Danvers. This is where the timing problem lies.

So in the closing moments of Infinity War, Fury uses his transmitter, and Danvers shows up days/weeks later. It's conceivable therefore that the same thing may happen offscreen in Avengers and AoU. The issue is the time taken for the signal to arrive with Danvers.

Contrast this with the closing moments of Endgame. Wherever Danvers happens to be, she sees a bunch of people reverse dusting into existence. She surmises that ""oh shit, those crazy avengers did some shit, I should call them. Oh shit, the communication line I have with Black Widow is broken. Something must be wrong. I'll head there right now."" And then she does so. She has the hex gates, so it doesn't take very long.

It's consistent."

AveUnit02,1613175467.0,"I’m not ruling it out, of course, I just think it’s unlikely. My personal opinion. I agree that Fantastic Four has been mad teased in this show, but so has Mephisto and I don’t think he’s showing up either. Marvel loves dropping throwaway lines and Easter eggs into all their projects, they eventually payoff."
TLKv3,1613175468.0,"I really fucking hope she can win some awards for this because she has been carrying the fuck out of this show imo.

I had high hopes and they're being crushed right now but damn I did not expect this show to be *this* good."
ChangeMyDespair,1613175480.0,Good.
a4techkeyboard,1613175483.0,"It is addressing the person who's supposedly done this, though. If anything, if SWORD was actually paying attention and had psychologists or psychiatrists on the case instead of armed people, they'd notice that if it is Wanda doing it, she's feeling all sorts of guilty and unsure."

pierzstyx,1613175557.0,She has spent the last few episodes totally in their system. My guess is that she built herself a bunch of backdoors so she could get in after everything was done.
DaikaijuSokogeki2001,1613175576.0,"It should also be noted that ""Hydra Soak"" from the episode 3 commercial is a possible nod to the soap that Coulson was convinced was brainwashing people in the Framework."

a4techkeyboard,1613175642.0,I think she might have watched some of them but I don't think it's to the extent that she has the details of a prop master and the entirety of TV tropes.

HanShotFirst18,1613175744.0,OG scarlet witch and vision costumes from the comic books!
Strawberrystarmiya,1613175747.0,Was the square the set from Gilmore girls?
Uralowa,1613175777.0,Darcy suggested that _passing_ the barrier is what warps them (presumably to fit the timeframe/narrative of the hex). So most people inside would be fineish.
treathugger,1613175795.0,Good call!

anrwlias,1613175883.0,"Sadly, that's not part of the MCU."
thornae,1613175895.0,"Yeah, the fun thing about this show is that they are a) *extremely* aware of their own metafiction, and b) have had *months* to plan all these easter eggs and visual gags.  

So like it absolutely 100% could be a reference but it could equally also be an entirely throw-away red herring to send you down an empty rabbit hole for a week between episodes.  

(Personally, I've given up looking for any meta references I don't catch on first veiwing. I'll collect them after it's done.)

Mark my words, this show is gonna get *so* many /r/moviedetails freeze frames over the next couple of years."
Noggin-a-Floggin,1613175902.0,"Well, they kept Evan Peters a secret."
GTSBurner,1613175904.0,"I don't think it's ironic, more coincidental - the actor, Jack Noseworthy, one of his debut roles was about a guy with a microchip in his head - which is a key plot point in Terminator 2."
SnitGTS,1613175907.0,Anyone think Hayward might be Ralph?
trouble6266,1613175912.0,"So I haven't seen this theory yet, but what if Agetha is actually one of the sisters of fate.  So far in Wandavision it has been Wanda dealing with the death of Vision, Quicksilver, and her past.  What if after Endgames Wanda went to find a way to bring Vision back and found out about the sisters of fate.  She was able to find one of them and convince/forced her to hep her bring Vision back.  This would make since with the necklace Agetha wears with three figures and why she was screaming that Vision was dead."
Wendigo15,1613175914.0,I feel like he would be the only one to talk her down
a4techkeyboard,1613175922.0,"I agree but the possibilities are that she walked into an existing Hex and her powers protected her, interacted with it, and commandeered it, or she was attacked and she fought it this way and then decided to stay, or she's still fighting whatever but for the moment has forgotten who she's fighting but subconsciously knows shes under attack so when SWORD showed up who she had just attacked she figured it must have been them all along, or she is doing all this by herself and she's just fighting her own conscience."
wtb2612,1613175926.0,I don't necessarily think they're going decade by decade as much as era by era.
KingTutWrapGod,1613175941.0,I'm positive that fear is unwarranted. Why on earth would disney sink millions of dollars into Disney+ projects for the shows that *directly deal with the fallout of the films* to be meaningless?
WhatIsAFerrette,1613175945.0,"Kinda interesting that Agnes has been positioned as a caretaker up until now but Pietro randomly takes over this episode without any participation from Agnes 🤔

I think they're in cahoots. Maybe Pietro is Maphesto 🤷🏽‍♂️ and Agnes is Agatha. Sort of like how we've seen Dormamu had Kaecilius."
Forgotten_Lie,1613175946.0,It would be kind of shitty for Wakanda or Dr Strange to cure the new disease when neither the nation or any past sorcerers did anything about all of the other diseases that affect the world.

MarcsterS,1613175987.0,Especially cause it *ended so abruptly.*
SteveRogers_is_alive,1613175992.0,Thats what I was thinking as well. I just haven’t trusted Agnes this whole time and this feels like she was trying to get Vision to believe in a certain narrative. Several times she’s done things similar to this in front of him now.
nickknack44,1613175998.0,the boys playing ps1 was good
TLKv3,1613176024.0,"Mephisto: ""Wanda, I can give you anything you desire in exchange for a contract. I can empower you. Make your Hex blanket the world... blanket it before time even began eons ago... I can make you *forever*.""

Wanda temporarily accepts, the world is blanketed as Mephisto begins to feed off her Infinity power and the Hex then covers all of time on the planet.

Wanda gets broken through to by one of the squad and realizes she's hurting everyone. She stops, accepts her grief and the Hex explodes... except creating Mutants all over the world since the very beginning of its creation.

Mephisto then freaks the fuck out before Wanda beats the shit out of him in anguish over Vision and takes her rage out on him before throwing him through a rift he opens.

Strange then approaches her asking for her help to finish what she started in Doctor Strange 2."

punchbricks,1613176164.0,"Seems like a whole lot of conjecture to me.

PM_ME_GLUTE_SPREAD,1613176195.0,"I’m not sure so much anymore. The more I think about it, the less sense it makes, plus, it would essentially retcon the entire MCU to date. 

I’m starting to think that it’s just going to effect Monica or that it might also end up with the fantastic 4 in some way. I just don’t see how it works to adequately explain an origin story for the likes of Apocalypse or Wolverine, for example, without being *wayyyy* too “Reddit writes a movie script”."
code_archeologist,1613176210.0,And the message in it... there is something feeding on Wanda's magic.
Apocalyric,1613176237.0,"It could just be fan service that they are using Evan Peter's, and not a real plot point.

Part of me thinks that mephisto has the souls of the townspeople, and Agnes has something to do with it. Basically, Wanda has power to solidify and expand mephistos hold, and he allows Wanda a certain amount of free reign to appropriate the souls at his disposal as a means to keep the arrangement tenable. Also, I think mephisto has influence on these people, and can possess them as needed, and so when it comes to herb or dotty or ""Pietro"", sometimes they speak for mephisto.

I don't think mephisto currently has as much influence as Wanda, but uses what influence he does have as a way to manipulate Wanda into doing his bidding."
LRedditor15,1613176237.0,Definitely. Agnes is probably his servant that's keeping watch on her.
JumpedRainbow9,1613176238.0,"This show stinks. It's boring, not mysterious, I don't care about any of the characters, the cinematography is basic and after 6 episodes nothing makes any sense. Nothing is funny or interesting going on in the show and it feels like a huge waste of everyone's time."

Pocketfulofgeek,1613176299.0,"This episode convinced me that’s not pietro. I already had my suspicions that Evan isn’t just a trick on Wanda but also on us as the audience. We expect him to be Pietro, but other than hope and fan theories we have no proof. 

He was probing for information. He was bragging about following the tropes. He was even mocking her at the end.

I don't understand how people are reading everything into that commercial except what it clearly was. It's about how Vision is trapped and trying to leave will kill him.
halfdeadwizard,1613176464.0,"I already couldn't stand Hayward but this episode made me absolutely hate him! I hope the final showdown of the series is Hayward revealing himself to be a shapeshifting Mephisto (or Nightmare) and a giant badass showdown with Wanda, Vision, Wiccan, Speed, Quicksilver and Photon teaming up to fight him as the Devil himself obviously can't go down that easily with a one on one. I'm scared Jimmy Woo is gonna go out in some kind of heroic sacrifice to save Darcy's life and I really hope not cause he's my new favorite non-powered character. Maybe in Wanda's reality Jimmy will become the MCU version of Gambit (get it? Hehehe 😄)"

Lana_del_Raygun,1613176555.0,"has anyone talked about how oedipal this series is? obviously not in the son killing the father and having sex with his mother way, but similar to the anti-oedipus way used by deleuze and guattari: vision is attempting to find out what it is causing westview to be plagued like oedipus was attempting to find out what was plaguing thebes, and he’s finding out that it’s his own wife. which is also similar to how jocasta figured out what was happening and warned oedipus to stop searching for the truth, only for her to kill herself — like how vision almost killed himself too, trying to get help for the people of westview."
lolzidop,1613176561.0,"No, but considering there are 3 episodes left, one of which is late 00s/early 10s sitcom (Modern Family/The Office) and the other 2 are like Episode 4, it's likely that they'll want the finale to take up the last 2 episodes. Plus the 4th episode was called ""We interrupt this broadcast"" and was placed what would be half way through the sitcom episodes (3/interruption/3/finale). So I really can't see them doing the final 3 as outside/sitcom/outside, because it breaks it up a bit too much for what is the final act."

Ron_Walking,1613176612.0,"I took the eras as major changes to the genre.  Early and even mid 90s weren’t that big of a shift from the 80s.  It wasn’t until the late 90s, represented by Malcolm which started in early 2000, that major shifts started to happen.  I see it less as a thematic choice to skip the 90s and more they wanted each episode to be noticeably distinct. The Malcolm episiod still had mostly late 90s references anyway."

caliguy420,1613176755.0,"It may be speculation but with the introduction of Marvel's first family they're not gonna drop a big name like Reed Richards without making a big announcement of who they casted for such a big role. They made a big announcement to say they're introducing Dr. Doom in BP2 and wouldn't leave a big intro such as Reed Richards to a cameo in WandaVision. After the backlash from the last F4 movie Marvel has to be very formulaic with how they reintroduce them again. So while my thoughts may be speculative, we have to consider how Marvel Studios has worked historically. That leaves me to believe that Monica's contact is either someone already in the MCU or someone who's not a headlining comic hero."

Therefor, I think the shark, which is often displayed as a deadly creature is this “Pietro” and billy is the kid trying to escape the island (town) using his magic. It’s also all “for the children” so perhaps it’s a way to convince billy to take himself/ and his family out of the hex."

Fresh Prince has always felt like an 80s show to me for instance, which makes sense given it started Sept of 1990. 

But Malcolm for sure is the quintessential 2000s family sitcom. The way they filmed it in a lot of ways forshadowed what was coming in the late 2000s and into the 2010s."

Luxury-ghost,1613177129.0,"I mean, you asked me to explain it, and I did very clearly explain it.

The fact that Fury transmits on the pager, dies, and then the Avengers meet Carol *days* later shows that that specific line of communication is very slow. It's therefore not conjecture that when Fury contacts Carol, it takes a while for her to show up.

Natasha and Carol speak in real time during Endgame. It is therefore not conjecture that 2023 technology allows for instantaneous communication between Earth and wherever Carol is.

I just double checked, and the Universal Neural Teleportation Network jump point things are shown in Captain Marvel. It's therefore shown that Danvers can cover huge distances very quickly, and has been able to since the 90s. We also know that there is one close to Earth, because that's how Danvers and the Kree arrive on Earth during the Captain Marvel movie. It is therefore not conjecture that Danvers has the potential to travel interplanetary distances incredibly quickly.

So, I have used on screen evidence to establish that if Nick Fury called Carol to Earth during the events of Avengers and AoU, it likely would have taken days/weeks for the signal to reach Carol. I have also used on screen evidence to establish that between the start of Endgame and roughly half an hour or so into Endgame, the Avengers implemented a real time communications channel with Captain Marvel. I also used on screen evidence to show that Captain Marvel can travel interplanetary distances very quickly.

Conjecture has been minimal. Things changed during Endgame. The narrative is pretty consistent."

I think he is just acting like Pietro as thats what Wanda wanted when she wished for Pietro, but accidentally picked up another Pietro from another universe, so she had to fill in the details for the ""plot"" of ""the show"" to work.

Think about all the planes and cars that likely crashed as a result of pilots and drivers disappearing. It's likely thousands of people just died from crashes like that. 

You also have to think about 5 years of living with this existential crisis that something like that would bring about. 

All in all I think the snap and the time skip is genuinely one of the best plot devices for a movie series like this. It allows for that tragedy and hopelessness to really have an affect on people even if it does end up being reversed. The people who survived it don't end up the same way. I think other than weird stuff like Homecomings miscalculated ""8 years later"" the MCU has done well when it comes to time and spacing out events once you get past the weird phase 1 stuff. Compare how time is used to good effect in the MCU like this to how awful some other series do. I mean the last SW trilogy had 2 films take place in less than a week then a year jump then the whole First Order is gone.

It seems like all he really did in this episode was goad Wanda into reliving her memories and using that pain to control her powers. He even pushed Vision to go patrol while he stayed with the twins and Wanda. Almost like Vision learning the truth threw a wrench into his plans and he had to take matters into his own hands."
Objective_Bottle_941,1613178640.0,Wait can you explain how the Parent Trap connects to Mephisto’s motivation I’m not following
dguy101,1613178640.0,No. The most I expect is an appearance or end credits scene with Strange.
BrunchIsAMust,1613178642.0,She still has it.
workfuntimecoolcool,1613178642.0,"Did anyone else feel kid Pietro was dressed up as Hasslehoff Nick Fury in that cutaway at the start of the episode?

Just me?"
JonSpangler,1613178655.0,Clive Anderson or nobody!
ndrw17,1613178671.0,"It should also be pointed out that she was literally parked at Ellis Street, as if she was already trying to leave and got ""stuck"", but the odd thing is that she was still able to talk and move, even before Vision ""woke her up"", when no one else around them was able to..."
hirotdk,1613178671.0,"The Walkman is attached to him, just like his clothes. It plays at his speed, the same way his clothes move at his speed. The music playing at the speed of the scene is just a diegetic switch for the audience's enjoyment.

If we were to take his powers as a simple ""he moves fast"", the air in front of him would compress so hard as to melt his skin off, the vacuum behind him would cause a cavitation bubble that would destroy whatever was around the area he left. Additionally, the signals of his nervous system can't travel through his body fast enough to allow him to react to stimuli at that speed.

If we were to take his powers as localized time dilation, he would suffocate to death because fresh air wouldn't be entering his lungs when he stands still and the CO2 he exhales would just form a bubble around him.

What I'm saying is that this shit ain't real, and it's time to either suspend your disbelief of acoustical physics or just ignore these films."
rafikiknowsdeway1,1613178677.0,still had time and resources to build huge monuments to the disappeared though
HevyEdge,1613178680.0,maybe ultron will come back too
TheNameIsWiggles,1613178698.0,"""Nightmare"" was said twice."
Pm_ur_fav_nude,1613178700.0,This is the first week where I just REALLY don’t want to wait another week and need my marvel fix now.
The_Shoe1990,1613178703.0,"In the comics, Mephisto would feed off of Wanda's magic powers. That's what I think it was referencing."
GTSBurner,1613178709.0,What if not Reed - but DOOM.
MiamiGrad440,1613178719.0,Maybe she is just “acting” like she is under Wanda’s “spell”...
happysrooner,1613178728.0,"The promo ""maybe it's the case of the Mondays"" feels like the mockumentary style, but the costumes etc point towards Modern Family. I'd love an Office style setup for Vision though"
Sage_of_the_6_paths,1613178738.0,I hope it's John Krasinski. And we know Disney to some level pays attention to fan casts. Rasario Dawson as Ashoka in the Mandalorian is admitted by her to being a fan cast.
djseifer,1613178780.0,*OH FUDGE
No-cool-names-left,1613178786.0,Witchfinder Acting Director Hayward is on the case hunting down that Jezebel Wanda Maximoff.
PatButchersBongWater,1613178800.0,She has it outside of the hex.
totokekedile,1613178804.0,Next episode: Hayward goes to HR.
happysrooner,1613178819.0,Also why was she in their house for the opening credits sequence.
kaje15,1613178821.0,"Yes, but she came into the series as a villain it’s not out of the Blue.

We’re entering an era of the the story with super powerful heroes and no legitimate threats. It wouldn’t be outside the realm of possibility that they turn their most powerful hero evil.  There’s large segments of the first two avengers movies of our heroes fighting each other..(One of those was cause by Wanda). 

I am just saying I can see her as a temporary earth threat before things build up on the massive intergalactic and dimensional scale"
Amon7777,1613178824.0,You just used up your coffee break!
GTSBurner,1613178825.0,"So Disney would then have three female characters with elastic powers?  Female Reed, Kamala, and Helen Parr?"
BreafingBread,1613178835.0,Break next week.
otheraccountisabmw,1613178839.0,And that theme song!
Clovett-,1613178841.0,"I love the show so far... but i'm gonna be honest, the SWORD parts have been the weakest so far. When Darcy said she was going to ""hack"" the SWORD servers i thought they were setting up a punchline of her failing or something... you know, anything to not do the ""super hacker"" cliche... but nope, they played right into it. And the whole SWORD sections have had these sort of points that just don't compare to the amazing detail of the sitcom sections."
Stuck1nARutt,1613178841.0,"I mean, isn't everyone's money?"
Sefriel,1613178843.0,"But softball season is over, sir. Time to kick ass."
glazeglazy,1613178848.0,Thats probably why she blasted him
TheRatWhoSavedUsAll,1613178849.0,Anyone else thinking Monica’s engineer friend might be Reed Richards? At first I thought no and it wouldn’t make sense but we still have another cameo so it could be a chance for John Krasisnki to show up.
ndrw17,1613178854.0,"Considering the entire world is enamored with this show, clearly not the case."
dscotts,1613178856.0,Because that’s what hero’s do.
RootTips,1613178857.0,This is what I'm thinking
Dr_Dickem_MD,1613178863.0,"Not everything, just the mystery revealed.  Your still have to resolve the conflict which for all we know could be the best part of the show"
PatButchersBongWater,1613178870.0,"I’ll talk about it, what do you want to say?"
JAK2222,1613178870.0,Dormammu! I've come to bargain
Pm_ur_fav_nude,1613178892.0,"Ross and Monica are siblings, therefore it’s a family sitcom."
Josphitia,1613178909.0,For some reason the Gushers commercials always scared me
TinsellyHades,1613178916.0,"I liked how they did Fox's Quicksilver. I think it was one of the better characters they had. His powers were amazing to watch, it just that he is 100% OP. He is just that insanely has. Plus he would have to have the strength to run that fast, for as long as he does, so he isn't necessarily a glass cannon. So, he wouldn't be that great in the MCU. He was perfect for DoFP, which one of my favorite X-Men films."
wenzel32,1613178922.0,Yeah he died countless times lol
Sefriel,1613178922.0,"Dammit, Disney..."
rafikiknowsdeway1,1613178925.0,Uh....so what the fuck does it take before calling in whatever avengers are left? like banner and falcon and uh....whoever else is still on earth
StoneGoldX,1613178925.0,"He's Gyrich, when Gyrich is written correctly. On a certain level, it makes sense to be wary of the nuclear bombs with arms and legs."
RaisinInSand,1613178942.0,I'd be down for Evan Peters as MCU Mephisto tbh
kingofthemonsters,1613178942.0,Kids these days amirite
DeadSweetHenrietta,1613178956.0,Probably not. His casting is also pure speculation soooo....
dguy101,1613178970.0,No way. The Richards' most likely won't be introduced until Ant Man.
Sefriel,1613178971.0,He cross classed to monk and maxed his Dex for card and hit modifiers
PatButchersBongWater,1613178995.0,Can’t break the seal.
hemareddit,1613178995.0,"I don't think the issue was the potency of her power, more like variety. She started with telekinesis and telepathy, then she was down to just telekinesis pretty much.


Now though, she's full on reality warping, changing things on a molecular level, transforming objects and living beings at will...


Although I think that's not all her, like her raw potential is there, but her powers are being hijacked by someone far more knowlegable and experienced...Mephisto or another supernatural being. This would explain the explosive growth in power in such a short timeframe."
DataRepresentative56,1613179004.0,"Did anyone notice how towards the beginning of the episode when tommy, billy, and pietro were playing video games billy talked to the camera and it seemed like he was the only one able to see it? Pietro gave him a weird look like “who are you talking to?”"
ebon94,1613179030.0,That’s what does him in at the end of the season
knoxvile10,1613179039.0,It didn't feel like that to me. I want to  believe that she was acting but there weren't any clues that she was.
31_hierophanto,1613179039.0,"Uh, no, Bewitched is actually owned by Sony (Both the original TV show and the movie remake with Will Ferrell in it)."
TheRatWhoSavedUsAll,1613179050.0,I know but a man can hope!
AARonBalakay22,1613179059.0,The kid actors in Hill House were all phenomenal so it’s cool to see them get more roles
PatButchersBongWater,1613179060.0,Why are you watching then?
midnighthana,1613179061.0,"To be honest at one point I was thinking ""They could reveal that Pietro is actually Deadpool in disguise and I wouldn't even blink"""
TheRatWhoSavedUsAll,1613179065.0,"I agree, just won’t be surprised."
DarZhubal,1613179076.0,"The thing is, he definitely died for a reason. He saved Barton and a civilian. He also remembered that one Halloween differently. What if him “getting shot for no reason” and the skewed memories are because he’s from a different universe. What if those events are  actually what happened in his reality and this really is a multiverse Quicksilver?"
happysrooner,1613179081.0,He even lists the things he's supposed to do for the episode and ends it with - isn't that what you wanted ?. He's definitely being mind controlled by wanda to do all this.
GTSBurner,1613179112.0,We learned from the 1/6 insurrection that government IT security is trash.
PatButchersBongWater,1613179116.0,And Tommy as Speed...?
BizzarroJoJo,1613179118.0,"I mean you would have had people fall from the sky, people pop up in the middle of the road getting hit by cars. people popping up inside of new built buildings and stuff. It would be absolutely insane. It's says that at about any given time there are 500,000 people in the air. That means you would have at least had 250,000 people just drop out of the sky and go splat all over cities. it would have been pure hell on a level only something like image comics could do."
Leafygoodnis,1613179121.0,"I feel like that part of the line is probably just to placate her about his memories - like ""yeah, it's *definitely me* and not Mephisto in disguise""


But I think the second part of the line is the truth. ""I heard you calling... And I answered."" I think she was calling out without realizing it. Before the show began, when she was feeling empty and alone. She wanted Vision back. She wanted her life back. She called out, and someone definitely answered. Just not her brother, and not anyone you should be making deals with."
Altheron86,1613179125.0,"Well, I wouldn't mind some light tapping dat."
AARonBalakay22,1613179132.0,It’s like the perfect Claire Dunphy impression
dguy101,1613179137.0,"Nah, I'm sure they're just under Wanda's control. And Hayward is most definitely a bad guy because clearly he wants Vision's body for his own purposes."
Sefriel,1613179151.0,Unexpected X3:TLS reference but I dig it.
lucas776,1613179153.0,"So is Evan peters qs just fan service and the multiverse isn’t actually opened? Because that is way more boring than any of the theories out their

Edit: I don’t hate the show I was just really looking forward to the show introducing the xmen universe"
DeadSweetHenrietta,1613179168.0,I personally want Bill Hader.
BorBurison,1613179169.0,">he’s taken down Dormammu

That was less him and more the time stone tbf"
Altheron86,1613179170.0,"Good question. It seems she is set up overall as the quirky, nutty neighbor."
StoneGoldX,1613179173.0,"I'm guessing we'll find out the answer as to just how canon AOS is when Ms. Marvel hits. Do Inhumans already exist, or do they need to reintroduce them?"
bryandesilva,1613179183.0,"Another good question is how much wanda can enlarge the hex, maybe the entire world? Maybe that's how they are bringing the x men"
glazeglazy,1613179207.0,"All i could think of was ""your not the boss of me now"" lol"
WuntchTime_IsOver,1613179226.0,"Well hes an interdimensional being like Dormamu, he has no physical body and cant enter our realm as a whole. 

In the parent trap, (its been a while so i read a quick summary, disney fans dont castrate me if i get things wrong) the twins in that movie are seperated at birth and live with different parents, meet at summer camp at random and swap places with the other to spend time with the other parent. Ultimately they both want to get the parents back together. 

Its shaky at best and something I'm still trying to completely sort out, but i was just saying maybe he cant enter our realm as a whole being and the twins are each a piece of Mephisto pulling a parent trap in the MCU to keep Wanda/Vision together in order to weaponize Vision for the purpose of giving Mephisto a physical body. Agnes is obviously there to help that along, willingly or other wise. 

Recall the director saying something like ""You dont know what it took to keep the lights on!"" - - Was that something a deal with Mephisto? And now he's trying to reneg and kill Wanda to stop Mephistos plan altogether. 

Again just trying to think out loud more than actually say this what I think is happening"
pilot3033,1613179226.0,"Definitely some 90s in last week, more early to mid. Big *Married... With Children* and *Everybody Loves Raymond* vibes."
mrslippyfists1211,1613179275.0,"Yeah Pietro volunteers real quick to go trick or treating so Vision can wander and find Agnes conveniently waiting across the road from the wall of the Hex. Where she is somehow the only person able to keep on mustering while everyone else is non-responsive. Plus being Agnes she knows Vision would probably choose her out of everyone to ""awaken"". Which he does and then decides to leave the Hex. 

I think they wanted Vision and Wanda separated for 1. So Pietro could try and pick Wanda's brain and 2. They want Wanda to unlock her powers. They tried it with the dog last episode and when that didn't work decided that if Vision was on the verge of dying/leaving that she would do something drastic. Which is why Pietro was being cruel with the dead husband comments cause he knew it would push her to act."
PatButchersBongWater,1613179282.0,?
BorBurison,1613179292.0,Oh hi Roy.
ajohndoe17,1613179305.0,Well now this HAS to happen
Slodes,1613179317.0,"One minor nitpick is she should have asked him about his new accent, people generally don't forget to their own accents."
dguy101,1613179333.0,Forget when it was mentioned but wasn't there mention of someone being under cover in Westview? Maybe Strange somehow brought Pietro back from the multiverse and filled him in on what's going on. I really don't think they're bringing him back for shits and giggles.
ritzbitz8,1613179334.0,I thought the same thing about Pietro!
xXEolNenmacilXx,1613179336.0,That shark in the commercial was feeding off 'yo-magic' too.
DarZhubal,1613179354.0,I don’t know what I’m going to do in three weeks when I no longer have Wandavision to look forward to all week.
No-cool-names-left,1613179360.0,"Ah. My bad. I thought you were like ""Dur, I don't get it. Do the work of explaining for me."" Sorry for the uncharitable reading."
RivetheadGirl,1613179361.0,Did you see her crying?
cardslinger1989,1613179373.0,"Well he’s strictly implied he’s pietro multiple times. Not Peter. They’ve made it perfectly clear his memories are not of the fox universe. 

So yea he’s not Peter."
jlusedude,1613179386.0,"I don’t disagree with your sentiment there but I’m not sure I full agree either. I think they would want to make an announcement unless they planned on introducing them as a surprise in a show. That, they might keep quite."
WhatIsAFerrette,1613179453.0,Spot on! I totally agree!
BreafingBread,1613179463.0,"Which could be just a toss-up as only some languages used feminine articles, while some used masculine articles.

Her saying “that’s my guy” this episode mostly solidifies that it’s a man."
aw_rnd,1613179468.0,"There was an interview with Kat Dennings where the interviewer asked her about how her sitcom experience would help her in WandaVision.  Kat literally said I can't talk about that.  So yeah.  I wonder what her ""character"" will be."
MRoad,1613179477.0,"Friends ran before Malcolm in the Middle, right? Disney made the right choice with MitM."
wenzel32,1613179507.0,TBF Norm never corrects him either because he's pre-occupied with being afraid.
Kaeison,1613179516.0,"I think that it's especially suspicious that, despite having been ""frozen"" before Vision freed her, when Vision put her back under Wanda's control, Agnes was suddenly able to do a U turn and drive back into the city. If she was frozen before, why wouldn't she be frozen again?"

tetoffens,1613179552.0,"The series is meant to be a major tie in to Doctor Strange 2: Multiverse of Madness. We're getting the multiverse and pretty definitely it's starting in this series. We know we're getting it, it's just a matter of how specifically it starts. I wouldn't be surprised if they do throw us a curveball on that and some of the things we think are multiverse related so far don't wind up being though."
TheNameIsWiggles,1613179555.0,"Not a lot of people talking about Agnes being dressed like a witch, followed by literally cackling like a witch while she was herself. I think her reveal is coming soon.

Edit:
Oops, didn't scroll far enough. Definitely people talking about it."
StoneGoldX,1613179559.0,"No, Stryker is pretty evil. Engineering mutant assassins so you can commit genocide is pretty solidly in the ""evil"" camp. I get that mutants are crazy powerful and can destroy us all, but Stryker is heavy on the Josef Mengele scale. 

I can see some rationality in Gyrich, when he's not written as a straight-out villain. But not Stryker, either in the movie, or the comics, where he's a totally different dude."
shockstreet,1613179579.0,It sounds like SWORD isnt a fan of Supes period so I assume thats why
Myfourcats1,1613179583.0,Pietro said he got shot in the street for no good reason.  He was shot for a good reason though.  He saved Clint and the kid.  I wonder what’s up with a Pietro.
wenzel32,1613179585.0,This is the best explanation. It's not a specific year or time-travel. It's Wanda creating a time period with multiple elements of that span of years.
_Surferdude_,1613179607.0,Pietro is a manifestation of Wandas subconsciousness.
the-giant,1613179639.0,Same. I'd also seen Tommy in a not-bad Canadian horror flick called Z on Shudder; didn't realize that til this week.
glazeglazy,1613179640.0,Its like an old video game how the system is stronger when focused on what you are currently doing but the background is slowed up
tinyfisty,1613179646.0,"I don't know what it is, but the MCU has really nailed flying special effects better than anybody else. Vision gently landing on Ellis Ave in front of Agnes' car was so simple and well done, but in any other non-MCU show or movie, that kind of stuff always looks terrible to me."
wenzel32,1613179653.0,Two episodes in a row we get a visual that is VERY similar to X-Men. This time it felt like Xavier.
oakwoodqq,1613179671.0,"It's a male, rewatch the episode."
Sefriel,1613179674.0,"That's a really good spy, that she might not have been seen in the broadcast. I remember thinking Darcy skipped her when describing the pool drinks scene in Ep2, where she told Woo about Rambeau."
StoneGoldX,1613179674.0,"Eh. First, I'm not sure how complex Doom really is.

Second, while I can understand having a problem with metahumans taking the law into their own hands, causing the death of I forget how many to get them to beat each other up places Zemo firmly into the baddie side of things."
pumkinspicedeodorant,1613179677.0,Ya wonder if “Pietro” is really just Doctor Strange in disguise?
logicallunacy,1613179679.0,"If I was a showrunner I would bring him back just for shits and giggles, but that's because I enjoy the chaos

Pm_ur_fav_nude,1613179690.0,"Yea, Tom Holland is still early in his Spider-Man, mcu speaking. He still has a lot of story left and I don’t think we need a lot of time with two Spider-Man at a time."
TinsellyHades,1613179697.0,But...those episodes were....black and white...
Camdino_The_Great,1613179708.0,I understood that reference
kermy_the_frog_here,1613179720.0,Bruh I’m pissed that episodes aren’t as long as they should be!
aw_rnd,1613179725.0,I'm really late to this: but damn Vision is actually alive?  I thought he'd turn into a pile of robot pieces when he got out of the Hex.  Should have turned off the cape before escaping.
Karkava,1613179739.0,There's also the camera *lingering* on the woman glitching in the matrix.
Darth_Korn,1613179741.0,Why wouldn't he know who Vision is? We're they not together in Age of Ultron?
Bethorz,1613179745.0,It can be both things
Sefriel,1613179746.0,But have we all done that because that outfit was in the promo? Hmm.
Routine-Pineapple-88,1613179780.0,"I'm starting to get the notion that everyone who she's completely manifesting consciousness for such as Pietro, Vision, Tommy and Billy, (not the normal townsfolk) are manifestations of her own subconscious and she's starting to utilize them to get through to herself.    
Perhaps manifesting these other consciousnesses/personas is the only way she can get around whatever has gotten into her head preventing her from remembering things, thinking independently and understanding how this is happening. If her thoughts are being experienced by someone else, can the entity vexing her do the same to them, or is it exerting too much power dealing with ""Wanda"" alone, leaving the other personas a little power to think somewhat more freely?

  
\-She knows Vision will always do the right thing, which is why his persona is the one doing the math, tring to get answers from her and trying to break free to get help for the people in the town.  This would be the good side of Wanda who is trying to do the right thing. Vision being Wanda could be how he has the power to un-hack the town folks' minds.  Could also tell us that Wanda herself is scared, which is why Vision said that he was.   
\-Her twin was likely the one who kept her on her toes, knew her better than anyone, and who she likely trusted the most in the world, which is why Pietro's persona is asking tough questions of her that otherwise set her off when Vision posed them- how are you doing this, etc.  Perhaps she manifested the Pietro persona as a way of addressing the questions and issues that Vision posed to her which she doesn't know how to answer.  To me, this is the biggest crack in the surface since it shows that Vision is getting through to her, so she's starting to question herself and realize something is wrong.  Also explains how Pietro knows things that he shouldn't since he supposedly had no consciousness from the time he was killed until the time she ""called to him.""  
\-As for Billy-  Wanda and Vision aren't getting along since the Vision part of her subconscious is untrusting of the ""Wanda"" part of it, making ""Wanda"" (or what's controlling/guiding her) mad at him.  She still loves him, though, so the Billy part of her subconscious maintains that connection, thus reacting to Vision being in danger.  She didn't know exactly where Vision was beyond the Hex, so Billy couldn't know exactly where Vision was, either.  


If so, I think once they all realize she's been compromised and unite, she'll be able to fight against what/whoever is controlling/guiding her.     
\-What if she can't break free from \[Mephisto or whoever's\] control, so she separates herself from that part of her consciousness once again (think cutting off one's hand to escape handcuffs), leaving behind yet another shard of herself that remains a device of \[Mephisto\] and becomes its own entity...  
 ...and if Vision's consciousness and physical appearance was maintained when he was outside of the Hex...  ...that means Pietro, Tommy and Billy could be ""real"" as well... ...and so could this new entity...  
If this world inside the Hex is Wanda's ""dream"" that is going sour...  
  What if Wanda is creating Nightmare and the Hex becomes the Nightmare Realm?"
dguy101,1613179792.0,"So my hypothesis now knowing that Wanda is capable of increasing the size of Hex is that by the end of the show, the Hex is going to engulf the entire Earth. I have a feeling that Wanda is going to snap whether due to Vision dying again or her kids getting taken away causing her to take control of everything to fit her reality and thus cracking open the multiverse.

I don't think Black Widow, the Eternals or Shang-Chi will have any connection to the events of WV. So that of course brings us to SM3 which we all know by some of the casting announcements is going to for sure have some aspects of the multiverse. We'll see new Spider-Man take down the Sinister 6 most likely with the help of Toby, Andrew, and maybe even Miles Morales if we're lucky.

That'll bring us to Doctor Strange 2 which will be all about breaking apart the Wanda created multiverse and taking down the true villain who has been manipulating her this whole time (either Nightmare/Mephisto). I do think one of those will likely be the villain of WV who will get taken down by the end of the season but the other will be the true string puller revealed in Doctor Strange 2. Eventually by the end DS2 the true reality will be returned and Tommy and Bill and X-Men QS will somehow get stuck in our world thus setting up both Mutants and the Young Avengers.

Tear me apart if you don't agree.

EDIT: I think the Sinister 6 will be made up of characters from all three (four?) universes as well: Doc Ock from Tobey universe, Electro from Andrew universe, Mysterio, Vulture, and Scorpion from Tom universe and either Tom Hardy Venom or maybe Rhino from Andrew universe."
kermy_the_frog_here,1613179799.0,Yea it seems like he’s flip flopped sides so many times now idk who’s side he’s on anymore lol

I wonder if there's anything to it. Cause all the super beings were in their super hero costume which would be their true selves. 

And Agnes was a witch. Which is what every one is expecting her to be if she is truly Agatha Harkness. 

And then the only other character from the credits we see in costume (I believe. Correct me if I'm wrong) is Herb. Now there's a theory that Herb Williams is the High Evolutionary Herb Wyndham. I'm not saying that he will be revealed as that. I just thought with that theory it's an interesting choice for his costume. 

He's Frankenstein or more precisely Frankenstein's Monster. Now the High Evolutionary is sort of like Dr. frankenstein (truthfully more like Dr. Moreau) he makes half man half animal hybrid abominations that serve him as his warriors of Wundagore. I think they made him Frankenstein to convey the mad scientist association cause it's easier than a lab coat and whatever.

If this somehow is really Pietro, and he was somehow revived after the events of Age of Ultron and “heard Wanda calling for him” how would he know of Vision’s death? If that was his timeline he would have been long dead while Thanos went on his stone heist. 

What I’m thinking is that Fury, who we see in his SWORD base in Far From Home, sent Talos undercover as Pietro into the Hex to try and stop this ordeal. While in his base, Fury would naturally still get reports and logs on all the supernatural happenings on Earth, whether is be through SHIELD, SWORD, or Talos undercover as him. This means that Fury would know of both Pietro and Vision’s death as well as the Hex. Fury could send Talos undercover as Pietro so that he would not be altered upon entry and retain his own thoughts and memories, explaining how Pietro seems to be somewhat “omnipotent” on the happenings outside of Westview. Another added point is that Pietro, unlike the other “real” people, (Vision and the twins), seems to know that everyone in the Hex is a real person changed by Wanda’s doings, which could only be known by somebody outside of Westview and inside of SWORD/SHIELD.

While I have issues with the acoustical physics too (I’ve got lots of issues with those scenes), my main complaint is about the gimmick of the Walkman more than how unrealistic the scenes are.  They could have just not used it, and still played era specific music during those montages, but they wanted to shoehorn as many era specific references into those movies to double down on the “we’re not in the 2010’s anymore” themes.

Taking the Walkman out of those scenes wouldn’t fix them for me, but at least I’d be a little less annoyed when people talk about how those were the best things about the Fox Quicksilver, and how based on those best things, they want him in the MCU."

All the shit with them and hayward that is happening now should have happened then and they should have condensed the sitcom garbage nobody cares about to at least half its runtime and it would have played waaaaay better.

So it could be taken at face value and I think that's totally valid since we don't have any hard confirmation right now. But he doesn't really have the full memories of Pietro it seems - the one time he references their childhood, Wanda remembers it differently, and then after that he either deflects or mentions dying and then immediately waking up to her calling him (which, knowing that Pietro was shot to death is probably not hard info to obtain). He's very cagey about it which is odd.


If he is XCU Peter Maximoff, being ""recast"" as MCU Pietro, why doesn't he have more elaborate memories? And if he is playing a ""role,"" how is he able to break out of it so casually and talk about the kids/the sitcom reality of it all/vision being dead, etc.?


If he is actually the real MCU Pietro in a different body, why is he so interested in the mechanics of the world immediately? How is he able to catch on so quick? And why would be know Vision died if the last thing he remembers was being riddled with bullet holes? He contradicts himself there.


I think he's probably Mephisto in disguise. He calls Billy and Tommy ""demon spawn"" at one point and is very interested in hanging out with them/developing their powers. Billy is suspicious of him too, suspecting him to secretly be a vampire (a supernatural being who feeds off others?) He wants to push Vision out and let him die after he starts questioning the reality + almost getting Wanda to listen to him. He's feeding on ""Yo Magic"" (Wanda's magic) so the more she uses it, the more it drains. It's not entirely confirmed but I think it's pretty close to it."

I think MOS/BVS  is king on flight in all aspects.

Other productions do what WW84 did. Basically have nothing exciting happen with there being no integration between the environment the person flying. They are just panning through the air. Or it's a closeup for reasons."

Shifter25,1613181611.0,"Given Agnes's reaction this episode, I don't think the ""actor"" is aware. I think the ""characters"" Wanda is controlling are becoming more meta as Wanda is forced to confront her traumas more.

My theory from last episode: when Agnes and Herb were talking, and Agnes stopped him from finishing the sentence ""We're all...""

""We're all Wanda.""

She's controlling all the people around her, but there's a strong subconscious element to her control; they do things that she wants, but not always quite in the way she wants them to."

If they made the credits go faster to 3 minutes, that's still 3 minutes of credits and the same content.  This isn't new.  There's 20 minutes of credits at the end of every movie.

viper2369,1613181692.0,"Late to the discussion I know, but thought of something I think may well just be an Easter egg, but it would be the second episode in a row where they played on a similar scene with Magneto in the first X-men.  

Last week it was turning his own guns on Hayward.  

This week may be a little more of a stretch.  She told the boys don’t go past Ellis Ave, and we clearly see later in the episode that’s right at the boundary of the Hex.  They acknowledged that going through the barrier has done something to Monica’s cellular structure (maybe activated the x-gene in her?).  Then at the end of the episode they show the hex exploding outwards and encompassing more people, with no idea how it’s going to effect them.  

This is what Magneto was attempting to do on Ellis island in X-men."

TOMNOOKISACRIMINAL,1613181750.0,"I agree. I think if they bring in Mephisto or Nightmare it will be in MOM. I don’t think either are involved in the events of WandaVision. Maybe Wanda’s pocket universe will tear holes in the multiverse, allowing some big bads in. Or maybe the huge amount of energy Wanda is wielding will attract some extra-dimensional threats. It just feels like so far everything is set up to be all Wanda’s doing and throwing in some new, all powerful being like Mephisto would be awkward this late in the show."

halfdeadwizard,1613181782.0,"Unpopular opinion, I know. I feel like the season 2 hate is just a bandwagon and the the ninja shift of the storyline people complain about didn't bother me one bit, especially watching Frank snipe em down and saying ""See you around, red"". I would say I like all the Daredevil seasons equally but when it comes to Punisher, season 1 was definitely way better than season 2. Can't forget that Punisher vs Kingpin prison fight, moments like that inspire me to be as much of a badass as I can in real life whether I fail or not. Reminds me of the alleyway fight in The Fist Avenger where Steve gives his first ""I can do this all day""."

Ko8iWanKeno8i,1613181938.0,I thought I couldn’t be the only in thinking this. Way too many hints at how the hex can give powers. It only makes sense that a lot of people will be mutated by it rather than just Monica. The argument of course being that she went through more than anybody else

As for what they’re doing with Vision, I kind of doubt they are trying to reanimate him (especially if Hayward is traumatized by super powered people like I think). It seems like SWORD wants to understand how he works so they can use bits of his abilities. He’s a vibranium/flesh hybrid, he can fly, he can phase through things, stuff like that. 

I can see them using that knowledge to make robots but I don’t think Hayward wants sentient weapons to the level of sentience of Vision."

That is not at all what that wiki link says being a nexus being means."
Vanden_Boss,1613182353.0,That scene actually made me think he isn't Mephisto. He seemed genuinely curious as to how Wanda was doing everything. If he was Mephisto (assuming Mephisto is behind it all) then he would know.

What if Heyward is a Hydra or AIM agent or even more wild, Mephisto or Nightmare? 

My theory is that Wanda didn't break into the SWORD facility where Vision was being held. She broke out. She's admitted to not remembering why or how she even got to that point."

The Incredibles playing in the theatre is a notable anachronism, however. But I guess Wanda can break the rules if she wants. What if she just really likes the Incredibles?

Important note: The Incredibles is a movie about a superpowered family trying to balance their mundane life with their superpowers. The Parent Trap is about twins that get separated and meet a long time later. Very topical movie choices, Wanda."

-	next episode based off modern family
-	reed richards not going to debut

The fact that you disagree with me is irrelevant, it’s the manner in which you did so.

“Idk man, I don’t think the astrophysicist is Richards, also I think the next episode will be Modern Family” would be the sort of friendly banter one might expect to disagree with in a thread filled with fans.

The wall around Westview changes people on the cellular level when they cross through.

Repeated exposure does more harm.

So, what if, at some point, the wall spreads around the entire globe (for an instant) and then snaps back. Forcing everyone to pass through twice. And if the theory is that this is how Mutants are being introduced, then, that'd be a reasonable way to make it a global issue.

that brings me to these questions:

1. why does Pietro have super speed? Vision has his powers because he is still pure vibranium and is being powered by mind stone(i.e Wanda). Is he really from the x-men universe or is it all imaginary in Wanda's head?

2. how tf did she create 2 kids, that too superpowered, out of thin air? is she creating matter? Thanos needed all the infinity stones to do something similar but on a bigger scale."

lilacjive,1613184357.0,I think Vision created Pietro as a distraction so he can figure out what’s going on.
infez,1613184359.0,"Specially twins messing with their parents.

Do Billy and Tommy have a tiny bit of some sort of control? They aged themselves up, they talked to the camera Malcolm in the Middle–style this episode, and when Pietro showed up Wanda seemed surprised."
a4techkeyboard,1613184359.0,"Yes I didn't forget that but I thought it meant that that Hex wasn't hers, but now she's adding her power to it.

You know, like if you move into a house but add a lock and maybe some cameras. She might not have built the house, she could add a lock though."
the_Athereon,1613184366.0,"Second question.

Pietro mentions the fact that Wanda had been hiding the children away somewhere all this time. Which gets me thinking. Is there a limit to how many people she can control at once (evidence being the further from town you go the less people seem alive) and if so, does that mean with the massive influx of new people, someone's going to naturally break free soon?"

KOPBrewHouse,1613184382.0,"I don’t know why everyone thinks Hayward is the big villain, clearly he’s a secondary antagonist, but he’s just a bureaucrat who wants Vision’s body (hold for snickering). I also doubt he’s Hydra, they did that bit back in Winter Soldier. Seems doubtful they’d repeat that plot line.

Also they are very clearly leaning on Quicksilver being someone more sinister. The chances he’s a mutant from some other mediocre dimension with terrible continuity and like 3 good characters is highly unlikely. I love speculation but at a certain point it’s depressing to see the mental gymnastics to keep the “Quicksilver from the X-Men movies” theory going."
LS_DJ,1613184387.0,"It’s also a great amount of time to use because it’s long enough for people to begin to move on and cope with the horror of the snap, but short enough for the people who came back to say “it wasn’t that long”"

justmystepladder,1613184528.0,"Well if you wanted to either A) drive Wanda insane/tear apart the whole charade, B) force Wanda to continue to escalate the use of her powers (say, so that you could resurrect someone?), and/or C) to get rid of one of the only people capable of protecting Wanda  — wouldn’t convincing vision to leave/try to leave play into your plan?"
YogaMushy,1613184531.0,"I dunno.

She was partially responsive before Vision woke her up.

She didn't correct Vision when he called her Agnes.

She then went on her merry way after Vision put her back under.

DeadSweetHenrietta,1613184575.0,"Yeah there is  nothing strange at all.

It's too meta and he's too weird to be an actual version of Quicksilver.

He knows this is fake, but still plays his role.

Claims to have memories from their childhoods that don't match up with Wanda's.

Deflected when she asked him a direct question to test him.

Knows alot, but has some missing information.

Asks alot of questions.

The dead husband joke semed to be intentional to provoke her.

His super speed is MCU QS not Fox's.

He knows what she's done with the kids.

Questions the expansion of her powers.

Meta reference to KickAss, in KickAss 2 ATJ is obviously kick ass and his friend Evan Peters takes the name AssKick.


It's fucky to say the least. He doesn't seem like either version of QS.

Also would like to add Evan Peters is amazing, I was completely against any hint of Fox until this episode."

the_Athereon,1613184611.0,He does seem a lot more sinister than I'd expect someone in his position to be. Something's not right here. And they haven't explained why he wanted Wanda dead either. Maybe he's trying to take back Westview because she'd stole it from him?

WarMachine425,1613184746.0,"Hold on, are they setting up Monica to be the first ""Mutant"" in the MCU? Obviously a departure from the comics, but I think it's possible...

Darcy says that Monica is getting changed on a ""molecular level"".  On top of this, Wanda's Hex in Westview, NJ is only a few miles away from Westchester County, NY... home of Xavier's School.   I could imagine it expanding to the point were it would unlock a few people with some kind of hidden mutant gene who are located in the North East U.S.

Just a theory, and honestly I hope I'm wrong... because this wouldn't explain how Xavier had time to grow up, master his powers, and create a school for young mutants anyway."
klartraume,1613184762.0,"And there's no evidence the kids are 'only' magical constructs, either. Most everyone assumes her children will be part of the MCU going forward and heroes in the Young Avengers.

mike_charlie,1613184774.0,"I was thinking this too, I mean will it have much of an effect due to it not being loads of extra people to control (as in another towns worth) but on the other hand she did turn large amount of buildings and structures to fit into her mindset.

HornyBastard37484739,1613184804.0,"I wonder if something traumatic happened to Hayward  that has something to do with superheroes, like how Zemo hates them because his family died in Sokovia.

Lysdexic-Serpon,1613184932.0,"Him knowing how the other quicksilver died had me doing mental gymnastics.. Then Wanda seeing him with bullet holes threw me even deeper down the rabbit hole.

The only way he could be good is if he was plucked from the other universe and mind warped into having the other quicksilvers memory of death.. And Wanda seeing him and Vision in their dead forms is just her own trauma haunting her.. Not reality."
JWilkesKip,1613184937.0,"I’m still totally on board with the Mephisto theory! In the comics, Mephisto is based on the demon Mephistopheles from German folklore: Faust made a deal with him at a crossroads, exchanging his soul for worldly pleasures. Wanda was at a similar emotional crossroads after the events of Avengers: Endgame. She confides to Pietro how she felt empty and completely alone. Maybe Wanda made a deal with the devil and then got way in over her head?"

shadowCloudrift,1613185318.0,"Oh man that Yo-Magic commercial got me triggered. As a kid growing up in the 90's, sometimes your mom pack a jello, yogurt, or pudding (or have it from the cafeteria) and those goddamn peels sometimes just won't budge. So you then do something drastic like try to open it from the middle, which just creates a mess.

Also as someone who grew up on X-Men Evolution, it felt like Pietro's personality really resembles him with being a smartass and immature like in that show.

Wanda jammed this ""Pietro"" into a person's head, and they're still playing a role, but also themselves a bit, like how Monica was able to ask about Pietro, and Agnes and Herb can still ask about the fiction while they're being influenced.

KatsKilledjake_95,1613185969.0,"I feel like she unknowingly casted, and gave Pietro all the knowledge about previous events, and what kind of world their living in (being her own cognitional one). Subconsciously she doesn’t want to be doing this, so without thinking she just thought of her brother and went throughout the multiverse to grab the closest Pietro she could find (that’s not evil, nor dead).

Shadesmctuba,1613186061.0,"That wouldn’t explain why he looks different though. Talos is a master shape shifter. He would look exactly like Aaron Taylor Johnson’s Pietro. That would somehow involve Talos traveling the multiverse, meeting the X-Men’s version of Quicksilver, coming back to the main universe, and being told to shapeshift to him, possibly not knowing about the original Pietro.

We got a few hints as to the falout in the first act of Endgame, but everything seems to have gone mostly back to normal by the events of Spiderman: Far From Home. So I don't think it was Mad Max style apocalyptic terror, but probably a complete upheaval of most governments and social institutions. We saw refugee flotillas around Liberty Island, many people living with severe PTSD (Steve's support group), severely rundown and nearly abandoned suburban areas (Scott's house), etc."

J3litzkrieg,1613186635.0,"The kids are real, at least to an extent, and definitely aren't in on it with ""Pietro"". Not only do the kids appear to act genuine when confronted with Vision being in trouble, Pietro does the complete opposite. I highly doubt the line about Vision dying twice was something Wanda said to herself, along with a number of different lines he used throughout the episode indicating she doesn't understand who this person really is. As for being ""real"" they've already established that when Wanda creates something ""new"", she still has to use already existing material to do so. If that wasn't true, why would she even need to have real people around to fulfill her fantasy? She could simply magic up some illusions and call it a day. Instead she's literally altering reality and bending real people to her will. IMO, the kids are real, and did in fact come from her own body. She just rushed their physical and mental development the same way she does everything else, because subconsciously she probably realizes she can't keep this up indefinitely... this is her only chance to have the ""normal"" life she wanted with Vision, and she's dead set on making it a reality before the show gets cancelled. 

As for Pietro, my money's still on him being Mephisto... could certainly be a red herring, but I have my doubts."

HippiesBeGoneInc,1613186722.0,"I don't think the recast is a real nod to anything (I mean it is, but it isn't important in that way).

eudaimonia_dc,1613186754.0,"Love the show, but I do wonder how they are going to explain why the Avengers aren't involved.  Wandavision seems to take place a few weeks after Endgame, so why wouldn't the Avengers be responding to what seems to be the disappearance of an entire town in NJ?

Uncanny_Doom,1613186872.0,"The origin is a big deal though. The aspect of mutants being natural is huge for a lot of the X-Men's themes where as Inhumans, who are still a sort of outcast in the Marvel universe, have an element of established lore and history to themselves branching out and creating their own societies and stuff.

I just think it would be foolish to blur these two properties when there are mainstream/casual fans who already get them mixed up and X-Men fans are *particularly* hostile towards Inhumans because they felt threatened by the implications of past comic storylines as if they were real-life.

I can't imagine that making the X-Men like Inhumans in this particular way (essentially being created by a power) would go over well with a lot of people. I can already see the clickbait headlines and threads to come for years complaining about and parroting talking points about it if it were to happen."

Besides stopping the biochemical weapon thing, Wanda threw the bomb *away* from a crowd. People died, but I'm sure that many more people would've died if Wanda didn't do what she did. She mitigated the damage. She did her job. I don't understand why the international community reacted so extremely to it."

Zaladin03,1613187616.0,"After tonights episode, i’m thinking Nightmare and Mephisto are involved. Mephisto because of the evidence we have so far and now after the yo-magic commercial, I’m thinking Nightmare.  In the commercial, the shark says “hungry? I used to be hungry all the time” and the boy asks “what did you do” and the shark replies “snacked on yo-magic”. 

Nightmare’s powers include siphoning from psychic energies of subconscious minds, and that description surely seems pretty accurate for Wanda. Plus we keep  almost each character that has escaped or briefly escaped from being controlled, has described it as a “Nightmare”."

athenasalmond,1613187725.0,"I don't think the hex will envelop the planet entirely, that to me just doesn't make sense. Why would Wanda want that? However, I think that in the last episode, the barrier will explode - or fall, but I like explode better. And since the Hex is containing all the radiation inside, like Darcy said in episode 4, once the explosion happens, that radiation will spread across the world and activate the X genes. But I don't think they'll introduce the mutants yet, so by gradually making people be affected by the radiation released, it's a pretty good way to - just how Marvel likes it - slowly build the world where the X-Men will exist."

Jaqueso,1613188023.0,"Which is either a reference, or foreshadowing, to the origin of those kids in the comics:

“Mephisto later manipulates the sorcerer Master Pandemonium into gathering the five scattered fragments of his soul that were lost in an ill-fated encounter with the aforementioned Franklin.[12][15] When the Scarlet Witch attempts to use magic to conceive children with her husband, the android Vision, she unknowingly summons two of Pandemonium's soul fragments, which are born as her infant twins. The revelation of her children's origin, followed by their loss when they are reabsorbed into him, drives the Scarlet Witch insane.[16]”

PS- Mephisto is essentially a demon."
bon_bons,1613188035.0,MCU and marvel are time and time again distinct entities. If they introduce mutants now that they own Fox they have to explain why they didn’t exist for the past ten years of MCU. I think the guys theory is totally legitimate and even likely.  Also you’re being very rude and condescending about comic books online.
tubular1450,1613188037.0,"CSI territory haha what a perfect descriptor. Agreed on Dennings too, although some of that could be the writing.

I feel like the dialogue outside the hex has been a bit weaker the last couple weeks, it feels very...TV serial, ironically."

schroed_piece13,1613188189.0,"Okay so my theory is that Agnes was pretending in the car to be in a trance and is deliberately leading vision down a path to keep him distracted. Then pietro is keeping on Wanda on this path like “no you’re doing the right thing keep going”.

I think they’re working together. They’re feeding/fed off wandas powers and are now trying to remove vision from the equation."

mwthecool,1613188285.0,"I think Vision is a manifestation of Wanda's desire to exit the construct that she's created. It's subconscious, and that's why it's manifested in him. He's dead in the outside reality, so it's not as if she can grant him his free will back."
thanosball6,1613188295.0,"Yes it fucking would, why give her all this power and the oh no she couldn’t handle the power give me a break. It’s clear marvel wants to depict mental illness but making Wanda into a villains is a terrible way to do so"

faithdies,1613188311.0,"So here's my ""not actually happening but they could take it this route"" theory: they are setting Wanda up as Dr Doom. And Monica is Sue Storm. And then she goes back and rules Sokovia since that's her homeland. They could even lift the line ""you think an entire city could rise up against me and I could stop them?"". 

I don't think they are doing this. But, it was a fun theory to run through."
Kheldarson,1613188314.0,"Here's what I think: it's a semi-improv script with Wanda making up the scene as she goes. Being a reality-warper, she can just put your lines in your head as she needs to. So certain cast members are constantly ""on"" as Wanda might need them at a moment's notice. However, if they're not actively in the scene, Wanda doesn't have direct control. So they're still ""in-character"" but more autonomous, like Vision. It also means they probably play into her scenarios to keep her out as much as possible, like two neighbors chatting over a fence or Agnes ""getting lost"". Little rebellions that play into the scenario but allow free will."
NYEESH,1613188321.0,"I agree. At this point, I'm almost kind of skeptical that they're even going to be able to wrap things up and I would be kind of disappointed if the end is just a cliffhanger that goes into doctor strange 2."

Wizzard_Elle,1613188349.0,"I don’t believe their DNA is being changed, unless they actually go through the wall/boundary. Darcy says Monica already went through twice, which makes sense only if we consider that she’s the only person from the outside who passed the boundary twice that we know of (the beekeeper is still inside, right?). 
Also, Monica keeps brushing off her test results, and refusing tests. I understand her trauma from her mom’s cancer, and how much she must hate this kind of thing. But did she already have powers and that’s why she doesn’t want to talk about it?"

AGR23,1613188358.0,"Speaking of that, i think i saw something similar when Vision was in the outer portion of the Hez where everyone was frozen, before running into Agnes. I think it was also a decoration, but it looked so weird especially when placed next to the frozen people."
eudaimonia_dc,1613188363.0,"That's a fair point.  I just assumed at some level SWORD has to report back to SHIELD, or at least have some sort of protocol to share information with them, so the Avengers would have heard about it.  But maybe SWORD is independent, or Hayward simply hasn't told SHIELD the full story, and so the Avengers (or if they've disbanded, former Avenger members) haven't heard about it.  I would imagine if someone like Hawkeye caught wind that Wanda has seemingly gone batshit insane, he would show up to try to talk to her."
marvelscott,1613188381.0,"I agree. With Agnes, you can see her moving back and forth before Vision arrives. They've clearly made the extra precaution to make sure every other extra doesn't move, so I think it's deliberate.

Also when the twins break the fourth wall, only Pietro notices, so he seems to be aware that there is a wall."
yeti77,1613188397.0,Yeah. That movie had problems. Them laughing off the snap/blip was short sighted.

Maybe the mind stone is somewhere in the center of town and Wanda is using it to amplify her powers. It would also explain the radiation, since Thanos released radiation with his snaps. The mind stone could be acting like some kind of broadcast antenna, which is why those outside the hex can tune into Wanda’s show."

- Not really related to the show but what was that commercial though??
- Why did it end so soon when it was getting good?!

""A mutate is a being who acquired a physical characteristic through exposure to one or more mutagenic agents such as chemicals or radiation. Superhumans who were not born with the potential to access their innate superhuman powers are mutates.
Mutates are typically characters that have been somehow genetically mutated in order to attain their superhuman abilities, for example by exposure to magic, radiation or toxic waste, through the bite of a genetically-engineered spider, et cetera.

Human mutates are sometimes called altered human[1] or non-mutant variant.[2]""

jesuschin,1613190262.0,"So each episodes commercial references a specific Infinity Stone that is being showcased by Wanda in that episode:

The first episode is the Mind Stone (Toaster Vision). It’s an episode that not only is showcasing her telekinesis (floating dinner ingredients in the kitchen) but also showing the mind control in play as Mrs Hart was showing something was amiss during that “STOP IT. STOP IT.” scene.

The second episode is the Time Stone (Hydra Watch). The episode is a typical 60s sitcom but then the end shows the beekeeper coming out of the sewer. Wanda then manipulates time and rewinds the whole scene. Everything changes to color, an  example of her moving time forward after that initial rewind.

The third episode is the Tesseract/Space Stone (Hydra Soap). This 70s episode ends with Wanda shooting Monica out of the bubble she’s created. The Space Stone has been shown to be an unlimited battery as well as capable of creating portals and doorways, Monica is thrown out via the portal through her unlimited energy barrier.

The fifth episode is the Aether/Reality Stone (Lagos Towels). The prior episode showcased how she has altered reality to reanimate the remains of Vision but this episode highlighted the lengths that this power can go to as she upends reality to recast her dead brother with another version from a different universe. 

The sixth episode is the Soul Gem (Yo Magic). This episode shows the scope of how she’s used the soul stone to basically bend the whole towns will to suit her charade. As Vision delves further away in the neighborhood he sees these individuals helplessly paused. One person tearing up as she’s forced to hang and unhang a Halloween decoration in perpetuity until Wanda allows her to play her part."

Valkyrie: I don’t think she has any powers, other than being badass.

Fury: Actually might be a good choice, he’s has the most experience with “enhanced individuals” out of any other non-hero MCU character.

Ant Man & Wasp: possibly some interesting stuff with the barrier and the quantum realm. Otherwise they’d likely just turn into an actual ant and wasp going through the barrier.

swissarmychris,1613191043.0,"> How is Wanda controlling the whole town and more at the end?? Or where did she get the ability to be super strong

Her powers are definitely growing stronger over time. In the comics she's extremely powerful, to the point of being able to rewrite all of reality. In the MCU she's not that strong yet, but she's getting there.

> Why and how does Pietro know about, well, everything?! I thought he was controlled by Wanda like Vision was but now anymore?!?

From the moment Pietro showed up, Wanda insisted that she didn't bring him there and seemed genuinely confused/surprised to see him. As for why he's immune to the Hex, we don't know yet.

> Not really related to the show but what was that commercial though??

I saw the message there as ""Learn to access your magic, or die."" Not sure if it's referring to when Wanda first got her powers, or if it's referencing something else.

> Why did it end so soon when it was getting good?!

Right?

> Is Vision not being controlled cause he's getting off script, and how is he alive outside of Westview? I thought he was dead??

He's always had a mind of his own to some extent. Wanda stole his dead body and reanimated him with her powers, but she seems to not be controlling him like all of the other townspeople.

He's still alive outside of Westview because the changes Wanda's making are permanent. Just like Monica's clothes stayed as a 70s outfit once she left, Vision stayed as his normal self. (Except he didn't seem to be able to stay outside very long -- the Hex may be part of what's sustaining him.)

> What is causing Wanda to lose control? 

It seems like more and more things were getting introduced that were outside of her control. Everything was perfect at first, but then the kids, Monica, Vision's suspicions, and now Pietro are all throwing her off. Plus she just made the Hex significantly bigger, which means it's probably going to be even harder to control."

They both seem like someone's lackeys.  Whether they are Wanda's or someone else's...I guess we will have to wait and see.

This whole episode seemed designed to get Wanda to make the Hex bigger.  Pietro was there to antagonize her about potentially losing vision again, and Agnes's goal seemed to be to convince Vision to try leaving the Hex, knowing full well that Wanda would have to enlarge the Hex to save him.  This certainly makes it seem like someone else is pulling the strings here, not Wanda.

Both Agnes and Herb have talked to Wandain a way that suggests she should know that this Hex thing is all about her, but each time it seems like that has just confused her.

Danvers is able to trade blows and match strength with Thanos, until he pops her in the face with the power(?) Stone, which decisively ends the fight.  Fat Thor is also shown to be able to do the same, albeit less ably since he's so out of practice.  But peak Thor at the end of IW was able to easily defeat full powered Thanos with a single blow.  

In terms of defense Marvel has the aforementioned feat of surviving a blow from the power stone and continuing to fight, while Thor was able to withstand what amounts to a concentrated solar flare from a star.  Both of those are capable of glassing a planet.

Thor just has a lot of anti-feats because he's been around longer and was at one of his lowest points while Danvers was at her best.  His best feats put him squarely on the same level as captain marvel.  Her powers might be slightly ahead of his but Stormbreaker is an incredible equalizer and currently the most powerful artefact in the MCU."

NinetyFish,1613192020.0,"Definitely agree.

I feel bad because I feel like Perlmutter was a reason why we didn't get a Captain Marvel movie earlier, which would have given her time to fit into the MCU better. Once they got the ability to do a female-led movie, they had to rush it and it ended up fitting terribly in to the MCU: why Carol didn't show up to help in earlier crises, how they didn't really have a plan for her in Endgame, how they had to film Endgame before the Captain Marvel movie so Brie Larson just got directed to be generic and bland in Endgame.

Honestly, it may have been better for them to delay the Captain Marvel movie for post-Endgame entirely and have her lead Phase Four and beyond.

Or maybe the flaw was in the Endgame writing. In hindsight, it was super cool to have Cap/Thor/Tony all fighting Thanos at once. But after seeing the first Endgame trailer, there was a lot of theories that Thor and Carol would be fighting Thanos together to distract/delay him while Cap/Tony work to undo the Snap elsewhere."

noneuklid,1613192431.0,"He's bad on a textual level and a subtextual level.  He's bad on a textual level because he's willing to play roulette with everyone inside.  Yes, he's dealing with a (possible) terrorist, but he's doing an *recklessly awful* job of it.  What actually did happen was arguably the best case scenario for him -- why would he think that a missile would kill someone who took on Thanos?  And how would things have gone if killing Wanda had caused the Hex to collapse and everyone in the town to just disappear, or be permanently brain-damaged?  You don't deal with a credible magical nuclear bomb threat on an entire town by picking *call their bluff* as your first strategy.  

He's bad on a subtextual level because his actions seem designed to incite conflict.  He withholds information from his subordinates, picks fights he can't win, and seems perfectly willing to sacrifice others to achieve his ends.  Unlike his terrible tactical choices, we do know that these might be things a real-world intelligence officer would have to do sometimes, but we also know that the ""MCU ethos"" punishes these kinds of behaviors (it's spent years showing us how Stark and SHIELD doing lesser versions of these things has cost the world).

I agree with your first point - the only reason for this Quicksilver to *not* look like Wanda's Pietro is if he's from an alternate universe.

Assuming the rumors are true, we're getting the previous Spider-men as alternate Peter Parkers as well, so this may just be the direction they're going with the multiverse."

scottthang,1613192589.0,"These insinuations that going through the Hex is going to give Monica powers makes me suspect something about Agnes. All along I thought she was Mephisto, but this episode seemed to imply she’s just a regular Westview resident caught up in all this. So why the avoidance of revealing her name?

I think her real name is gonna come out eventually and she’ll turn out to be a notable Super from the comics. Think Sue Storm-level revelation (please note I do not think Kathryn Hahn is playing Sue Storm).

Also WTF was she even doing there? You could say maybe she was fighting Wandas magic and trying to escape but no one else has shown an inkling of that. It's also very weird that she just so happens to be exactly where Vision is.

It's obviously meant to be read both ways but I think the scene makes more sense if you look at her as someone trying to manipulate Wanda for her magic. After she talks to Vision he tries to go through the barrier which leads to the hex increasing in strength.

Just my take."

But we already know Loki has been traveling the multiverse since Endgame...maybe he vists the FoX-Men universe at some point?

He cannot leave the hex (he almost died)

But why can't he? Is it because Wanda supercharged it (turned it red) and now unauthorized passage is fatal? Or is he tied to the hex because he is only alive within it?

Agnes however would be. She seems obvious to us but there's thousands of us all noticing small details and adding them together on this subreddit. I wouldn't have noticed most of them if I didn't look at these weekly threads. The average show watcher probably won't notice her suspiciousness until it's revealed and they'd be mindblown.

Ralph never being around. Their anniversary being the date the Salem witch trials started. Her devil jokes and how ralph looks good in the dark. Her always coming in at the right time with the item they need. Her referring to herself as a tiger in bed and then a tiger shows up on the kitchen table as a possible device to spy on them to know when to come over with the right item. Her being around all 3 times the twins grew up or tried to grow up. She even showed in this episodes intro.

I think there is a chance that Wanda’s magic backfired, and the Sword people literally chucked Pietro’s mortal remains into the hex. 
Wanda was super close with Peitro, so I think she more or less telepathically filled him in on the whole thing because that’s what she probably subconsciously wanted. He also showed up at the literal exact moment Vision was beginning to question Wanda about the town."

Wanda says she didn't do it, but she also doesn't know how she started all of this. She's using her power on a subconscious level. She feels lonely and her power reaches out to fill the void. She can consciously use it, like she's done to create the twins and change the world, but it’s also working independently of her conscious thought.

Hulk, even Smart Hulk, should be nowhere near a mind-controller. Besides, his arm is probably still gorked from using the gauntlet.

The technology (War Machine, Ant-Man and Wasp, etc.)  and ""better than Olympic-level athlete"" heroes (like Hawkeye) are totally out of their league on this unless there's some sort of quantum realm loophole. Perhaps Hawkeye could work well if communication could be established, but we're already past the point where Wanda is in the communication mood after they sent a drone after her.

Of course something else is going on, something is preying on Wanda, egging her on and possibly benefitting from Westview’s situation. Pietro certainly seems to be voicing that creature’s side of things. But Hayworth can’t reasonably know that nor be expected to dig for that when Wanda is behaving in this way and the suffering of so many people is paramount and pressing, not to mention the threat she poses to the world. 

Now I happen to agree the American Justice system is an absolute shizshow, so focused on retribution and profit that it maximizes recidivism and allows rape and worse. However. We’re not talking about the prison or Justice system, but an active hostage situation. Obviously you go by the book and try to talk to the hostage taker down, but if you can get the shot you take the shot. That’s basics."

Who is a cold sniper, established in his intro in the Avengers who prefer spending his time high-up away from everyone, and who spent most of the Avengers movie either actively fighting against the Avengers or being awkwardly distanced from everyone out of regret?

A penknife sometimes works. And when it’s all you got when a puma drops on your head, you don’t just roll over and let the cougar have its way. You pull it out and you fight. Maybe you come out looking like a different person, but you come out. And have several painful skin graft surgeries."

Whether that's shown to simply be Mephisto in the end or not, I was never even sure that hair raid on the facility to get Vision's body was her willful action, that she was already under another's control. Another entity devised this situation for reasons yet to be fully given, Wanda's grief made her susceptible to it and a large part of her has wanted to keep it going for therapeutic value. She told Pietro in the town square she doesn't really know how it all started, and I think that was 100% truth.

jisforjoe,1613195973.0,"Ep. 6 clarified the sequence of events on the SWORD side—it’s confusing from all the cuts back and forth.

Ep. 5–6 are all the same night for SWORD:
- Wanda causes the breach alarm. (5)
- She and SWORD have their standoff. (5)
- Wanda reinforces the Westview barrier, turns it red. (5)
- Darcy is back inside to see Pietro as SWORD begins winding down from the alarm. (5)
- Hayward comes inside with destroyed, pulsating drone all salty. (6)

The end of 5 makes some post-production choices that are inconsistent / confusing, making some think the barrier was breached again, which 6 confirms didn’t happen (or we would see everyone scrambling again to check what breached):

- Alarms blaring when Darcy approaches desk. It’s finally off when she says her “recast” line.
- The barrier is not red in her window view of the town. Ep. 6 corrects this and you can see the red energy from the SWORD camp window."

Edit: Wait no, Pietro and Wanda were there when Vision was ""born"". Pietro unplugs all the equipment with his super speed, then Clint shatters the glass underneath him and drops him out of the room just before Thor arrives. So they weren't actually on-screen at the same time, but you have to assume that during the planning and travel to Sokovia they at least saw each other.

Edit again: Went back and watched the scene, and Pietro comes back into the room as Vision begins his ""I'm not Ultron"" speech. He's standing right there as Wanda and Vision are talking, so they've definitely met.

She can't really talk about that with Vision because it would mean telling him that he's dead, but Pietro is another story.

jisforjoe,1613198614.0,"It helps to separate the town into separate classes, i.e. separate levels of “clearance“ people get when applying for different levels of classified jobs:

- **Regular townies.** Complete WandaVision NPCs. The biggest cohort. Have lives in the real world. Serve as extras in the town, with increasing levels of complexity and personality when Wanda is close or needs them in a “scene.” Mentally tortured by Wanda’s hex. E.g. Norm, the Harts, Phil, Dottie (?), Geraldine (until snapping out at the mention of Pietro), all the new Halloween cast.

- **Facilitators.** One level up from above. Handful of townies. Still hexed, but have a limited special awareness about Wanda, the hex, and the inability to leave. Unfazed by displays of super powers (card trick, super speed, kids aging up). Seem to have decided that appeasing Wanda and helping maintain the status quo is better than the alternative. “Should we take it from the top?” “Small towns, so hard to leave.” “Is there anything I can do? Anything you want changed?” E.g. Agnes, Herb, Dr. Nielsen, mailman (?).

- **Wild cards.** Pietro and the twins are in a class of their own. Pietro’s “vessel” is probably still someone sourced from the general population. The twins probably a combination of Wanda’s powers + unknown forces. Has powers, with twins immune to Wanda. Pietro has imperfect knowledge of their childhood together; deep knowledge of Westview’s enslavement, sitcom tropes, and major events after his death; and curiosity about how Wanda made it all happen. Pietro acts like a mole, out to pry secrets from Wanda. Can’t help himself about saying inconsiderate things, even at the cost of losing Wanda’s trust.

- **Vision.** “Resurrected” from combination of his remains, Wanda’s powers, and unknown force (?). Moral code and sense of reason intact. Zero memory of life before Westview. Originally content by life with Wanda, which is breaking down. Is able (as a fellow child of the Mind Stone?) to snap hexed people out of the trance. Cannot exist in resurrected form outside of the anomaly.

- **Wanda.** Queen bee. What she says goes. Will remix the town at any sign of disturbance to her desired outcomes. Can “pause” the world when she needs to step out or make major changes. Unsure of how it all started, hinting at yet another force we have yet to explain.

It could also just be showing a mix into the early 2000’s and be an error on Disney’s part, but I feel like it’s not an error to show those two films. 

The two films also represent the plot line: the incredibles: a superhero family tie in with Wanda, Vision and the kids.

Disney wants these series to be “movie equivalents” and not a second-rate project like most series have been.

It will most likely be Dr Strange since that’s the only one that makes sense, and since Benedict Cumberbach is a leading man solo film actor it will look better. 

Not sure I’m explaining this well enough though lol. Right now we have Wanda, Vision, Falcon, and Bucky.

I hope we learn more about Vision's backstory.... It seems the townspeople recognize and respect him even more than they do Wanda.

Even if he is Fox Quicksilver, though, it doesn't seem like the actual reveal will come until the very end. Once the Hex is gone and everyone in Westview goes back to normal, we might learn that Quicksilver isn't Pietro Maximoff...he's *Peter* Maximoff, and there's our promised lead-in to Multiverse of Madness."

Notice that the computer girl cautioned Monica about going back into the hex because her blood work was getting all messed up. My theory is that people can only enter and exit the hex so many times before the damage accumulates.

If it was real X-Men Quicksilver, wouldn't he want to engage in this conversation and want to figure out why they remember things differently? Instead he shut it down, like someone who doesn't want to be discovered.

Then it's pretty much confirmed that he isn't a Pietro when he mysteriously figures out that the world is fake, and makes a cold comment about Vision dying twice, not to mentioned him knowing about Vision's death in the first place.

We could justify that Wanda is using her powers to give life to Vision's corpse.

Which would explain why he is somewhat immune to her manipulation, and why he is able to free people's mind from her manipulation.

We could even explain the Hex to be a result of her subconscious mind running lose, as a result of so many traumas in her life so far. Which would explain why she appears to not have full control over what is going on in Westview, such as those people at the edge of Westview.

AveUnit02,1613201880.0,"There’s.. really not that much hype behind it though. There’s only perceived hype because people are attaching it to Reed Richards. She texted him, said he’ll be there in an hour, and it fits the timeline within the show. It’d be mad weird if she was like “I know a guy” and then he just popped up to the camp next scene like “oh here he is” 

Blue marvel is a pretty big character in the comics. I know the general public wants Reed Richards, but that would fall really flat and completely take away from the actual story. Like “here’s why her brother is here... and oh look what happened to Darcy... and then look here who is behind it all... here’s who Ralph and Agnes really are... and alsoooo HERES MR. FANTASTIC!”

ImFriendsWithThatGuy,1613202343.0,I think too many people are relying on some massive idea of Skrulls being involved in the story here or the future. I really don’t think they will play a large part.

I think the creative directors at Marvel enjoy the challenge of making better story telling than that.

Mattyzooks,1613202477.0,"Well, they will most certainly be doing an Office/Modern Family style episode this season but if it isn't next week, they might slip an Arrested Development or even Scrubs style comedy in between.  After Modern Family, are there additional styles to choose? I suppose the dramedy prestige comedies (Louie, Masters of None, Atlanta, and like half of HBO comedies) buuuut if they're sticking with popular family comedy tropes, the last decade outside Modern Family and CBS shows that still follow the 90s/2000s formula, i am curious to see how they keep this going.  Though they could stop the time progression at any episode.  
Quick aside: it'd be interesting if an episode goes haywire and keeps switching homages.  2000s, then 50s, then 90s, then prime time cartoon simpsons/family guy for like a minute, then a genre switch.  Lot of potential to get creative."

I really hope Marvel incorporates a lot of “the snap 5 year gap” elements into the story. It has so much opportunity in terms of intrigue. They were able to milk Sokovia fairly well so hopefully they can get some good stories out of the 5 year gap. Imagine a husband who was blipped who comes back to find his wife married to another man, with 3 kids with the new husband. 5 years is a long time. It’s safe to say that almost every remaining partner of a marriage/couple moved on in some way, which would cause such a massive cluster fuck of anger, envy, guilt, sorrow, and confusion. That would most likely be near apocalyptic of an event considering how fucked up it would be to the *billions* of people involved."

If it was the same MCU character (regardless of whether Wanda made him appear or another force), why make him look different? Makes no sense.

If it's not MCU Pietro but someone else entirely pretending to be MCU Pietro, who has no connection to the X-Men Pietro, then why would that impersonator want to look like the X-Men Pietro? Also doesn't make any sense.

If it's just an illusion ""because magic"", he could've looked like Aaron Taylor Johnson. Making him look different doesn't accomplish anything useful for the puppet master.

The only explanation for him looking like the X-Men Quicksilver is him actually being from that universe, but his behaviour being altered. Like his body is taken over my Mephisto trying to gain Wanda'a trust or something."

Evan Peters played Quicksilver in the Fox X-Men Films last decade, and is now playing Quicksilver *again* in The Marvel Cinematic Universe, despite the fact that those portrayals had different backstories and settings and slightly different personalities.

So he has to live up to not only fans' expectations of who Quicksilver is supposed to be, but he also has to live up to or succeed his previous interpretation of Quicksilver in another universe, while also living up to Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance as the character in Age of Ultron.

To add another layer of complexity, fans still don't know if Peters is playing the MCU Pietro with a new face/body for some reason, or if Peters is playing the X-Men Pietro somehow transported through dimensions into the MCU, though the latter seems to be less likely after episode 6."

Pietro also seemed eager for Vision not to be around, both by him jumping in to take over Trick-or-Treating so Vision could go off on his own and by trying to discourage her from looking for Vision when Billy said something was wrong. 

Could be he's just trying to keep Wanda separate from Vision so he doesn't influence her, but what if he just wants Vision to go exploring so Wanda has to expend more energy keeping him under control?  It definitely seems like Wanda's powers become more and more strained the more she uses them, so what better way to take her on than when she has so many balls in the air?
